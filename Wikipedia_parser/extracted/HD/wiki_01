The Age of Doubt

The Age of Doubt (orig. Italian: "L'età del dubbio") is a 2008 novel by Andrea Camilleri, translated into English in 2012 by Stephen Sartarelli. It is the fourteenth novel in the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series.
Plot.
Inspector Montalbano has a dream in between the tragic and the ridiculous, but it reveals how the two fixed thoughts he has had in recent years also accompany him in his sleep: the idea of death and his relationship with Livia.
In the dream, he's looking at his own funeral taking place and Catarella himself tells him that he's dead, a communication which is commonly entrusted to him whenever there are dead bodies to announce to the Inspector. Attending the funeral are the usual supporting team of police investigators: Coroner Dr. Pasquano, who grumpily refuses to give details on the deceased before the autopsy, Questor Bonetti-Alderighi, who does not authorize Montalbano to investigate his own death, his friend Mimì Augello. They are all there, except for the person who should be there in the first place: Livia, his girlfriend. An irritated Montalbano calls her on the telephone and she calmly tells him that most probably she won't have time to attend the funeral and that, to say it plainly, she will in fact seize this unique opportunity, his death, to feel free from an overlong relationship and look for pastures new.
A loud noise wakes Montalbano, caused by the stormy sea and lapping up to the balcony of his house. The sea and the port of Vigata now become the main background of Montalbano's new investigation, involving two vessels moored side by side at the Vigata docks: a powerful speedboat and the "Vanna", a luxury yacht whose crew has found a dinghy into the sea carrying a disfigured man killed by poison.
Montalbano suspects foulplay involving some of the vessels' crews and asks the collaboration of a female officer of the Port Authorities: enter then Laura, a beautiful and intelligent young woman who will fall desperately in love with the Inspector, who will in turn and simultaneously lose his heart to her, just like a passionate teenager struck by the classic lightning.
Action and introspection alternate in this 14th novel, which sees Montalbano wrestling with doubts and existential thoughts whilst trying to resolve a complicated case of diamond trafficking.

Self-absorption paradox

The self-absorption paradox describes the contradictory association whereby higher levels of self-awareness are simultaneously associated with higher levels of psychological distress and with psychological well-being. 
In 1999, Trapnell and Campbell explored the self-absorption paradox in relation to private self-consciousness or attention to internal aspects of the self. They concluded that the relationship of self-awareness to psychological distress derived from a ruminative aspect of private self-consciousness, whereas the relationship of self-awareness to psychological well-being was attributed to self-contemplative reflection.

P. K. Nair’s fascination with cinema began as a child and he watched his first few films lying on the white sand floor of a cinema in Trivandrum. He was a collector even then - collecting ticket stubs, lobby cards, even weighing machine tickets sporting pictures of the stars of the day. He grew up to be a great collector of films.
1,700 films were made in India during the silent film era, of which only nine survive thanks to the efforts of Nair. He travelled to remote parts of India to collect and save cans of rare films. The fact that Dadasaheb Phalke is recognized today as the father of Indian cinema is Nair’s doing. He tried to save any film that he could get his hands on, be it world cinema, Hindi popular films or regional Indian cinema. He even took world cinema to the villages of India.
He has influenced generations of Indian film students especially the Indian New Wave filmmakers such as Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ketan Mehta, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Jahnu Barua, Girish Kasaravalli, John Abraham (director), Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Kundan Shah.
The film is woven with interviews of several filmmakers and film personalities who have been influenced directly and indirectly by P. K. Nair, among them Krzysztof Zanussi, Lester James Peries, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee, Naseeruddin Shah, Kamal Haasan, Girish Kasaravalli, Jahnu Barua, Jaya Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, Saira Banu, Sitara Devi, Santosh Sivan, Rajkumar Hirani, Shyam Benegal, Mahesh Bhatt, Yash Chopra, Ramesh Sippy, Mrinal Sen and Surama Ghatak.
Besides the interviews, the film has rare footage from early Indian masterpieces like "Raja Harishchandra", "Kaliya Mardan", "Gallant Hearts", "Marthanda Verma", "Jamai Babu", "Fearless Nadia", "Sant Tukaram", "Achut Kanya", "Kismat", "Chandralekha" and "Kalpana" - all films that were archived and thus saved by Nair.
Production.
The production started at the end of 2010 and the film was completed in June 2012.

Mohanan, Abhik Mukhopadhyay, P. S. Vinod, H. M. Ramachandra, R. V. Ramani, Vikas Sivaraman, Mahesh Aney and Kiran Deohans.

Mount Celia Station

Mount Celia Station is a pastoral lease and sheep station located about south of Laverton and east of Kookynie in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.
The station has operated since prior to 1898. In December of that year a station employee, Mr William Pead, was attacked by two Aboriginal men. Pead drew his revolver and fired a shot in the air and one of the mean threw a waddy at him hitting him in the arm causing him to drop his revolver. The other then threw a spear at him which also hit him in the arm causing Pead to flee.
The owners of the station took each other to court in 1910 over a dispute arising from the sale of the property. The agreement struck in 1905 between Charles Robert Heppingstone and Robert John Stewart regarding the sale of the property including all improvements and stock resulted in Heppingstone suing Stewart for breach of contract. The complicated dispute made it to the Supreme Court and was heard by Justice Rooth. Rooth found in favour of Stewart, but described both of the men as being "questionable witnesses".
In 1923 the station was sold to Mr T. H. Pearse of Gums Station near Burra, South Australia. Pearse also took up the lease of neighbouring Yundamindera Station to have a total holding of about . Pearse then stocked the station with sheep imported from South Australia which thrived in the area resulting in heavy lambing in 1924.
The station was placed on the market again by the Yundamindera Pastoral Company in 1925. Being put up for auction in Perth the property the lease of which would expire in 1948. No bids were placed on the property.

Robin Samuel Anderson (Sam or Rob) Chaffey (22 July 1934 – 6 April 1998) was an alpine skier from New Zealand. 
He competed for New Zealand at the 1960 Winter Olympics. He came 48th in the Downhill and 58th in the Giant Slalom, but was disqualified in the Slalom. 
Sam was a downhill ski-racer, national ski champion in 1958, and was involved in setting up and managing Porter Heights, the first commercial ski-field in Canterbury. He was a high-country farmer and a businessman whose activities included setting up a reindeer farm in Alaska and a cattle breeding programme in Brazil. 
He was called Sam at school and in the ski industry, but changed to Rob for everything else by family agreement because of all the Sams in the family (including his father and one of his sons). He married Jan Prain (a sister of skier Trish Prain) in 1958; they had two daughters and two sons. He was born in Timaru, brought up on a farm at the back of Mount Somers, and died at home in Tai Tapu.

Baldsiefen Field

Baldsiefen Field, (Formerly: Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field #8), is a closed United States Air Force field. It is located 10.2 miles east of Valparaiso, Florida. 
Overview.
Auxiliary Field 8 is named Baldsiefen Field for 2nd Lt. Richard Edward Baldsiefen, a gunnery instructor at Eglin, killed 4 March 1942 along with Lt. John W. Smith, in the crash of AT-6A-NA Texan, "41-528", which came down at Auxiliary Field 4. It is designated Site C-52C.
History.
With the onset of World War II, the Eglin Field military reservation was greatly expanded when the Choctawhatchee National Forest was turned over to the War Department by the U.S. Forestry Service on 18 October 1940, and a series of auxiliary airfields were constructed from January 1941.
The history of the Field is largely unknown, although the runways are pockmarked with craters and patches. Those are likely from either bombs or explosive charges being detonated, with civil engineering rapid runway repair teams using them for training.
Current status.
The airfield was incorporated into Eglin AFB on 9 October 1959 and was inactivated. However, the airfield remains under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) as part of the active Eglin base and is not accessible to the public. Baldsiefen is located in an area of the Eglin base called Range 52. It is currently used for training involving rough field landings & takeoffs, cargo extractions, air assault landings & parachute drops. 
It appears to be used as part of the Eglin target range, as aircraft airframes are visible from time to time on the ramp, likely used for ground targets. Current (2012) imagery shows two F-15s, two F-4s, an A-4 and a propeller-driven aircraft on the ramp, with one F-15 sitting out between the runways. 
There also appears to be a vehicle R&M yard south of the airfield, along with a radio relay facility which is staffed by Eglin personnel.

Samuel Chaffey

"For the alpine skier from New Zealand, see; Sam Chaffey"
Samuel Chaffey was born in England and immigrated to Upper Canada in 1816 with his brother Benjamin.
Samuel and Benjamin's move to Canada was a result of the economic slump in England following the Napoleonic War. Their history is tied to a variety of business ventures primarily in milling with water power. The business endeavours of Samuel, in particular, had varied results.
Samuel is remembered in Canadian history because of the expropriation of his last mills. They were dismantled to construct a lock on the new Rideau Canal. The lock-station was named for Samuel Chaffey and the present-day community of Chaffeys Locks soon developed at that site.

2012 Sighetu Marmației explosions

The 2012 Sighetu Marmației explosions took place in the early hours of Sunday, February 19, 2012 in a nightclub situated in the city of Sighetu Marmației, Romania. The first explosion seriously injured 7 people. Another 10 people were injured in the second explosion, including members of a team of investigators at the scene.
First explosion.
The first explosion occurred at around 00:56 EET in a nightclub in Sighetu Marmației. Approximately 120 people were in the club at that time. The nightclub, which was located in the basement of the building, had no central gas connection. A club administrator stated that the nightclub was heated with heating and A/C equipment, and therefore could not explain the cause of the explosion. The police hypothesis is that the explosion occurred due to accumulation of gases coming not from the club, but from a nearby house. According to investigators, 7 young women were smoking in the club's bathroom, which triggered the explosion.
The women, aged 16 to 23, were injured, sustaining burns covering 30 to 60% of their body, affecting mainly their faces and hands. One of them was admitted into the local hospital, while the other six were flown to the Plastic Surgery, Reconstruction and Burns Emergency Hospital in Bucharest aboard a C-27J Spartan military plane. The girls were assisted during the flight by a SMURD medical team, a mission approved following a request made by the Under-Secretary of State in the Health Ministry, Dr. Raed Arafat.
Second explosion.
A second explosion took place at around 10.00 EET. Spokesman of ISU Maramureș, Cornel Băbuț, stated that 10 members of the investigation team were seriously injured with the second blast. Some of the victims were taken to Floreasca Hospital, some to the burns Emergency Service, and the rest of the victims were transported to Bucharest aboard a military plane. Preliminary findings steer towards the fact that there was a high concentration of gas in the area. There was a large crack in the welding of the main pipe that caused the gas leakage. The gas supply was turned off immediately after the second explosion.
Authorities reactions.
The prosecutors' indictment said that Sighetu Marmației "has perpetuated a state of mediocrity, of unprofessionalism, doubled by a thorough clumsy forgery of entire documentation relating to the gas distribution network".
11 people and the gas company were prosecuted for manslaughter, forgery, and abuse in service. Those charged included the former Vice President of the National Agency for Energy Regulation, who knew that the company had no trained employees and did not respect the city gas network.

Madrigal (Breaking Bad)

"Madrigal" is the second episode of the fifth season of the American television drama series "Breaking Bad", and the 48th overall episode of the series. Written by series creator Vince Gilligan and directed by Michelle MacLaren, it originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 22, 2012.
Plot.
In Hannover, Germany, Peter Schuler, the head of fast food operations for Madrigal Electromotive GmbH—the parent company of Los Pollos Hermanos—kills himself with an automated external defibrillator when police arrive to question him about his relationship with Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito).
Back in Albuquerque, Jesse (Aaron Paul) continues to panic over the missing ricin cigarette, worried that someone will find it and poison themselves. Walt (Bryan Cranston) hides the vial of poison behind an electrical outlet cover in his house and creates a fake one, planting it in Jesse's Roomba when he helps search Jesse's house for it. Jesse finds the fake ricin cigarette in his apartment. Jesse tearfully laments what he believes is his own stupidity and apologizes to Walt for suspecting him of poisoning Brock. Walt and Jesse later meet with Mike (Jonathan Banks) and offer him a partnership in a new meth operation. Mike refuses, believing Walter is a dangerous "time bomb". 
Saul (Bob Odenkirk) suggests that Walt use Gus' death as an opportunity to safely quit the drug trade, but Walter needs the money since Skyler (Anna Gunn) gave much of his drug earnings to Ted Beneke (Christopher Cousins) and paid for Hank's (Dean Norris) physical therapy. The main problem challenging Walt and Jesse's plan is the need for a new source of methylamine.
Meanwhile, Hank takes part in a meeting between the DEA and Madrigal's German CEO, who claims Schuler was a lone criminal within the company and promises full cooperation with the law. After the meeting, Hank's boss George Merkert (Michael Shamus Wiles) reveals that he was fired for failing to heed Hank's warnings about Gus. Merkert reflects on his friendship with Gus and wonders aloud who else might be leading a double life, which seems to strike a chord with Hank. 
An American Madrigal executive named Lydia (Laura Fraser) later meets with Mike and asks him to kill eleven men from Gus' operation in order to tie up any loose ends. Mike refuses because Gus paid them enough to keep quiet; however, when he is called in to meet with Hank and Gomez (Steven Michael Quezada), Mike learns the authorities have discovered and frozen Gus' Cayman Islands account, using the RICO Act to halt and seize payments to Gus' subordinates, including Mike, who had $2 million that he was planning to leave behind for his granddaughter, Kaylee.
Duane Chow (James Ning), Gus' methylamine supplier, calls to meet with Mike. Mike correctly suspects it is a set-up and gets the jump on Chris, one of his former men, who has already killed Chow. Chris explains that Lydia had contracted him to kill everyone after Mike refused, as he needs the money since Gus' payments have been seized by the law. Mike kills Chris and later breaks into Lydia's house in Houston, Texas. As he is about to execute her, Lydia's panicked pleas about her daughter affect him. He decides to spare Lydia in exchange for her becoming Walter's new methylamine supplier. Mike calls Walter and accepts a partnership in Walter's new meth operation.
Production.
"Breaking Bad" creator and episode writer Vince Gilligan spoke about opening the episode at Madrigal: "We always like to surprise our viewers, and the idea of suddenly opening in Germany seemed like fun. We also wanted to start showing you the business of Madrigal, the company that financed Gus Fring. Is Madrigal all corrupt? Or was it just a couple of executives?" He also spoke about Jonathan Banks, who was the main focus of the episode, and Mike's evolving over the series: "It’s a testament to the great actors on this show — Aaron Paul, Dean Norris who plays Hank — that those characters became more important over time. Jonathan Banks is just fantastic in the role." When asked if Mike was watching "The Caine Mutiny" in the episode, Vince stated: "That is "The Caine Mutiny", one of my very favorite movies. I was very lucky with that, actually, because it can be very expensive to use clips of movies, which is why you don't see too many clips on the show. But "Caine Mutiny" is owned by Sony/Columbia, our parent company. And yes, it may have some connection to where Walt is at this point."
Reception.
Ratings.
The episode was watched by approximately 2.29 million American viewers on its original broadcast, down from its series-high ratings of 2.93 million viewers the previous week.
Critical reception.
The episode received critical acclaim with many critics considering it a step up from the season premiere and praising Jonathan Banks' performance. Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" called "Madrigal" "terrific", stating: "One of the methods to "Breaking Bad"s endless fascination is the way it unfurls maps of inter-dependence. Certain characters may like to see themselves as independent agents, as lone wolves, but everyone is dependent upon someone else — someone else's errors, or rare twinge of good conscience — and thus must remain part of a group. It's a braided metaphor for the reasons we form societies." He did, however, wish the episode ended "more forcefully" with Mike making the reluctant phone call to Walt, rather than ending with the Walt/Skyler bedroom scene. "TV Fanatic"s Matt Richenthal gave the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars, commenting: "Through its attention to detail, direction and dialogue, "Breaking Bad" possesses an uncanny ability to enrapture and enthrall. You can't help but be invested in every moment." He also commented on Jonathan Banks' performance: "Overall, just a terrific showcase this week for Jonathan Banks. His portrayal of Mike paints the picture of an exasperated career criminal who excels at the game...and is resigned to his fate. He's funny... and he somehow manages to be the moral center of this operation, despite his willingness to kill and kill and kill."

List of Jewish Kabbalists

This page lists figures in Kabbalah according to historical chronology and schools of thought. In popular reference, Kabbalah has been used to refer to the whole history of Jewish mysticism, but more accurately, and as used in academic Jewish studies, Kabbalah refers to the doctrines, practices and esoteric exegetical method in Torah, that emerged in 12th-13th century Southern France and Spain, and was developed further in 16th century Ottoman Palestine. These formed the basis of subsequent Jewish mystical development.
This is a partial list of Jewish Kabbalists; secondary literature incorporating Kabbalah is enormous, particularly in the voluminous library of Hasidic Judaism that turned esoteric Kabbalah into a popular revivalist movement. Hasidism both adapted Kabbalah to its own internalised psychological concern, and also continued the development of the Jewish mystical tradition. Therefore, only formative articulators of Hasidic thought, or particularly Kabbalistic schools/authors in Hasidism are included here. In the Sabbatean mystical heresy that broke away from Judaism, only the founders are listed. Solely academic-university Jewish studies researchers of Jewish mysticism, not being "Kabbalists", nor necessarily Jewish, are not listed here; nor are separate non-Jewish derivative/syncretic traditions of Kabbalah.
Rabbinic figures in Judaism are often known after the name of their magnum opus, or as Hebrew acronyms based on their name, preceded by R for Rabbi/Rav.
Early Jewish mysticism.
Talmudic tannaic sages: "Maaseh Merkabah" (mystical Chariot)-"Maaseh Bereishit" (mystical Creation) (1st-2nd centuries). "Yordei Merkabah" (Chariot Riders)-"Heikhalot" (Palaces) mysticism (1st-11th centuries). are variously Traditional/Attributed/Anonymous/Pseudepigraphical:
Hasidei Ashkenaz (1150-1250 German Pietists). Mystical conceptions influenced Medieval Kabbalah:
Medieval emergence and development of Kabbalah (12th-15th centuries).
Provence circle (Southern France - Provence and Languedoc 12th-13th centuries):
Catalonia/Girona circle (North-East Spain 13th century):
Castile circle (Northern Spain 13th century). Developed Demonic/Gnostic theory:
Ecstatic/Prophetic-Meditative Kabbalah (13th century):
Publication of the Zohar (1280s-90s Northern Spain):
13th century Kabbalistic commentary:
14th-15th centuries saw a slowing continuation in Kabbalistic commentary:
Fusional influences (15th-17th centuries).
Influence of Medieval Jewish rationalism in Spain declined, culminating with the expulsion. Jewish fusions of Philosophy and Kabbalah were shared by wider non-Jewish Renaissance trends (not listed here):
16th century Kabbalistic renaissance.
Emigrees, some from Spain, some founding new centre of Safed in Ottoman Palestine:
Cordoverian school. Rationally-influenced systemisation of preceding Kabbalah:
Lurianic school. New mythological systemisation of Kabbalah. Basis of modern Kabbalah. "Kitvei HaAri-Writings of the Ari" written by disciples:
Safed dissemination:
16th-19th centuries Kabbalistic commentary.
Central European Kabbalist Rabbis:
Italian Kabbalists:
Sephardi-Mizrachi (Oriental) Kabbalah:
Sabbatean mystical heresy (founders only):
Eastern European Baal Shem/Nistarim and other mystical circles:
Mitnagdic/Lithuanian Kabbalah:
Hasidic popularisation of Kabbalah (18th century-present).
Kabbalistic notions pervade Hasidic thought, but it developed a new approach to Kabbalah, replacing esoteric theosophical focus with successive psychological internalisation. Therefore, only a minimal listing of Hasidic figures is given here; founding formative figures or commentators on esoteric Kabbalah texts/tradition.
Founding East-European Hasidic Masters:
Other Hasidic commentators on Kabbalah:
20th century Kabbalah.
From diverse traditions in Kabbalah (excluding Hasidic thought's internalisation approach):
Modern teachers of Jewish mysticism.

Squash Rackets Federation of India

The Squash Rackets Federation of India or SRFI is the Indian governmental apex body for the game of squash. It conducts the National Squash Championship, and promotes the game through the different state level squash bodies, and provides training facilities and selects the squad for the Indian team. It also chooses coaches for the national team (presently Cyrus Poncha and Major S. Maniam). The rise of squash worldwide with many players in the top 100 worldwide and India's higher rankings worldwide are a testament to the hard work put in by the administrators and players over the last decade.
Among the major facilities created by the SRFI is the ICL-TNSRA squash academy, which hosted the World Team Championship in 2007.
In 2000, the squash association of Maharashtra felt that the chairman of the SRFI, N. Ramchandran, was hindering the chances of players. Conflict between the SRFI and squash athletes came to a fore in 2005, when the government was conferring the Dronacharya award on SRFI affiliated squash coach Cyrus Poncha. India's number one squash player Joshna Chinappa wrote a letter to the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs that she never trained under Poncha, and that he had misused her name to get the Dronacharya award. 
The SRFI chairman Ramachandran then produced testimonials from Joshna where she acknowledges the support of SRFI and Poncha.
In 2008, the SRFI chose a woman's squad for the Asian championships without Dipika Pallikal, who was then training in Egypt, after having recently won the under-17 British Open. The federation cited irregularities in the paperwork in informing the group about her absence due to training, but it was felt that this might have been a rivalry with the Mittal Champions Trust which had been sponsoring her training abroad. 
The SRFI maintains the website indiasquash.com, which announces the national squash calendar and other details.

Interactive Theorem Proving (conference)

Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP) is an annual international academic conference on the topic of automated theorem proving, proof assistants and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and formalization of mathematics.
ITP brings together the communities using many systems based on higher-order logic such as ACL2, Coq, Mizar, HOL, Isabelle, NuPRL, PVS, and Twelf. Individual workshops or meetings devoted to individual systems are usually held concurrently with the conference.
Together with CADE and TABLEAUX, ITP is usually one of the three main conferences of the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR) whenever it convenes,
History.
The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11–14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the Federated Logic Conference. It is the extension of the Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics (TPHOLs) conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009. 
The first three were informal users' meetings for the HOL system and were the only ones without published papers. Since 1990 TPHOLs has published formal peer-reviewed proceedings, published by Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. It has also entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.

St. Peter's College of Toril

St. Peter's College of Toril (SPCT)... is a private Filipino Catholic school in Toril, Davao City. It is owned and administered by the Presentation of Mary Sisters, and guided by foundress Anne Marie Rivier. The school focuses on the teaching of religion, the integration of faith in all subject areas, and provision for daily living of the faith within the school campus. It believes that Catholic education is the formation of the total person rooted in the person of Jesus Christ.
SPCT is a member of the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), the largest organized group of Catholic schools in the country, with about 1,194 members as instituted in 1941.
History.
The history of the St. Peter's College of Toril dates back to July 1, 1948 when the PME (Pere des Mission Etrangeres) priest missionaries of the Foreign Mission of Quebec opened a Catholic School known as Saint Peter's High School. The school was a twin project of Santo Rosario Parish as the priest believes that a formal program of religious instruction to the youth of Toril was complimentary to their task of evangelization. Father Jean Bernard Bazinet, P.M.E. was the first parish priest and the first school director. The first school enrolment consisted of first, second, and third year high school levels and so in 1950,the school first produced its first thirty two (32) high school graduates.
Realizing, an urgent need for a more permanent management of the school, Msgr. Clovis Thibault, Bishop of Davao offered the administration of the school to the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary (PM). The offer was accepted in 1952 but the PM Sisters arrived in Toril only on May 25, 1953. Sr. Marie de Anges became the principal and at that point, the name of the school was changed to Saint Peter's College of Daliaon.
In 1963, the primary grades and the college department were opened. Courses offered were AB, BSE, and BSC. In 1977, the two-year Junior Secretarial course was offered but was closed in 1996. The following year, the intermediate grades were also opened. In 1978, preschool education or kindergarten was offered. In 2001, BEED was offered and in 2007 the BSBA course.
At the very start, the school consisted only of a two-story building with eight (8) rooms and gradually other buildings were constructed; significantly in 1986, the Rivier Building; in 1995, the science building was donated by the Alumni; in 1998,the school gymnasium; in 2002-2003 the John Vianney Building and the latest was the Presentation de Marie Building in 2009.
On November 23, 1989, the name of the school was changed to Saint Peter's (SPCT) and as the school administrators continued to explore ways to upgrade school standards, the grade school and high school applied for PAASCU (Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools Colleges and Universities) in 1990. Presently both departments, the elementary and high school are PAASCU Accredited-Level II.
In 2008, after years of hard work and dedication by administrators, faculty and staff, and support of parents, alumni and benefactors, SPCT, celebrated its 60th foundation anniversary.

Bangalore Military School

Bangalore Military School (Rashtriya Military School Bangalore or King George Royal Indian Military College) is a residential school in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, established on 1 August 1946. Bangalore Military School is one of the only five institutions of its kind in India; the other four being Ajmer Military School, Belgaum Military School, Chail Military School and Dholpur Military School. The cadets enrolled in these schools are known as Georgians, after their founder father King George.
History.
King George V (1865-1936) was the king of Great Britain and the emperor of India from 1910 to 1936. Though during World War I he had no direct responsibility, his duties took him to 450 military and naval installations, 300 military hospitals and to several other places for personally distributing as many as 58,000 decorations. It was during these visits that King George V was so impressed with the courage and fighting abilities of the Indian troops that at the conclusion of the war, he decided to set up some institutions for education of children of Indian Jawans. Hence these schools were named King George Royal Indian Military Colleges. Initially, these schools were opened between 1925-1930 at Jhelum, Jullundhar and Ajmer. In 1945 when World War II came to an end, two more King George Royal Indian Military Colleges were started at Belgaum and Bangalore by King George VI.
With the nucleus of 100 south Indian Boys, 50 from Jullundhar and 50 from Ajmer, the King George VI Royal Indian Military College (KGRIMC) had its origin in Bangalore in 1946. During World War II, the site of present school was used as a convalescent home for British troops. In the beginning, the staff were entirely military personnel, with exception of office staff who were civilians. Lt Col RHD Ross of the 8th Punjab Regiment, later transferred to RAEC was the first Commandant. In 1948, Lt Col Ross retired and left for UK. His place was taken by Maj TW King the first Indian Officer in Command. Initially, all instructors were officers, but they were gradually replaced by JCOs. In Lt Col TW King's time civilian masters began to be appointed.
Re-organisation of Military School.
Till 1952 Regimental Centres sponsored the sons of JCOs/ORs for admission to KGRIMCs. The aim then was to give education up to Army Special Classes and then make them VCOs. Some of them were also commissioned as officers.
In 1952, KGRIMCs were reorganised as residential public schools on the recommendations of a committee headed by Dr Hridaya Nath Kunzru. On reorganisation, public school education was, for the first time, brought within the reach of middle class. Admission was thrown open to sons of service officers and civilians as well. Instead of Army Special Exams, boys were now required to pass Senior Cambridge Exams. The motto then was Play The Game.
In 1966, King George Schools were renamed as Military Schools. Affiliation to the University of Cambridge was replaced by the Central board of secondary education (CBSE). The motto of the schools was changed to Sheelam Param Bhushanam which translates to Character is the Greatest Virtue.
In July 2007, the school was renamed as Rashtriya Military School Bangalore (RMSB), to reflect the 'All India' outlook of the school.
Category 'A' establishment.
Like all other Rashtriya Military Schools, Rashtriya Military School Bangalore is a Category 'A'(at Par with Rashtriya Indian Military College, National Defence Academy) Establishment under the direct control of DGMT(MT-15). All instructions pertaining to finance, training, admission and recruitment are received directly from AHQ (MT-15). General Officer Commanding, Karnataka Kerala and Goa Sub Area is Chairman Local Board of Administration.
Subdivisions.
In 1993, two "holding houses" were introduced- Cariappa for students joining Std. VI and Vishveshwarya for Std. VII. Similarly in 2002, a separate house by the name of Fifth House was instituted for the students joining Std. VI. These were disbanded later.
Admissions.
Admission to class VI
Students are not admitted directly to the school. Students aged in between 10-11 appear in CET for all military schools,
Admission to class XI
Admission to class XI is based on marks secured in the X class.
Reservations
Academics.
The school is affiliated to the CBSE of India. Unit tests are held quarterly in addition to half yearly and annual examinations. Students appear for AISSCE (10th) and AISSE (12th) along with other CBSE affiliated schools in India. Student to staff ratio is about 2.5:1 and student to teaching staff ratio is 10:1 which is far above the national average of India. Staff are recruited by central government from all over India. School curriculum includes eight periods of 40 minutes each. Daily two hours of compulsory prep is included in a routine for students to concentrate on studies.
Sports and physical education.

CRIU

Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace, or CRIU, is a software tool for the Linux operating system. Using this tool, it is possible to freeze a running application (or part of it) and checkpoint it to persistent storage as a collection of files. One can then use the files to restore and run the application from the point it was frozen at. The distinctive feature of the CRIU project is that it is mainly implemented in user space.
The project is currently under active development.
History.
The initial version of CRIU software was presented to the Linux developers community by Pavel Emelianov, the OpenVZ team leader, on 15 July 2011. In September 2011, the project was presented at the Linux Plumbers Conference.
In general, most of the attendees took a positive view of the project, which is proven by the fact that a number of kernel patches required for implementing the project were included in the mainline kernel.
Linus Torvalds, however, was a bit skeptical:
Project version 0.1 was released on July 23, 2012.
First major release.
On 25 Nov 2013 the team has announced the first major release of the tool—v1.0. The v1.0 tool supports x86_64 and ARM architectures and can work on unmodified Linux kernel version 3.11 and above.
Use.
The CRIU tool is being developed as part of the OpenVZ project. Though its main focus is to support the migration of containers, allowing users to check-point and restore the current state of running processes and process groups. The tool can currently be used on x86-64 systems only and supports the following features:
No kernel patching is required, all the needed functionality is available since Linux kernel version 3.11 from .
TCP connection migration.
One of the initial project goals was to support the migration of TCP connections, the biggest challenge being to suspend and then restore only one side of a connection. This was necessary for performing the live migration of containers (along with all their active network connections) between physical servers, the main scenario of using the checkpoint/restore feature in OpenVZ. To cope with this problem, a new feature, "TCP repair mode", was implemented. The feature was included in the v3.5 mainline Linux kernel and provides users with additional means to disassemble and reconstruct TCP sockets without the necessity of exchanging network packets with the opposite side of the connection.

World Resources Forum

The World Resources Forum (WRF) is the science-based platform for sharing knowledge about the economic, political, social and environmental implications of global resource use. WRF promotes innovation for resource productivity by building bridges among researchers, policymakers, business, NGOs and the public. The WRF Conference is an event in a series of high profile conferences on global resources issues, formerly known as R-conferences (Recycling, Reducing, Re-using), being organised since 1993. The WRF provides information about natural resources, trends and limitations in use and production, and serves as a platform on which to discuss their economic and political implications. The WRF is directed at academics, politicians, research-oriented practitioners, entrepreneurs, consultants and other professionals in the areas of sustainable development.
About.
The WRF brings the issues of global resource consumption and resource productivity higher on the agenda of policymakers and business leaders. Aspects covered by the WRF include the scarcity and security of supply as well as the price risks of key resources. The issues of pollution and energy use over the life-cycle of certain resources but also their social impact – in particular in developing countries – are topics examined by the WRF as well.
The WRF is set up as an association, with a General Assembly and Board. The WRF Secretariat, based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, is responsible for the coordination and organisation of the following activities:
Founding members are the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) the Swiss interdiscip­linary research institution and service provider for materials science and technology (Empa) the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) International Resource Panel, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and the city of St. Gallen.
Other members include the German Federal Environment Agency, the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences (A+)., the Rhomberg Group, the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), the Mercator Foundation Switzerland, the Association for Quality and Management Systems (SQS), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and others.
WRF2014.
World Resources Forum 2014 will be held in Arequipa, Peru, from 19–22 October 2014.
WRF2013.
World Resources Forum 2013 was held in Davos, Switzerland, October 7–9, 2013., and attracted over 400 participants from 53 countries and international organisations.
WRF2012.
World Resources Forum 2012 was held from October 21–23 at the China National Convention Center in Beijing, China, and attracted over 700 participants. Main theme of this forum, co-organised with the Chinese Academy of Sciences/Institute of Process Engineering, was Resources and Green Economy. The meeting report was published in April 2013. Summary reports and photos are to be found on the WRF website.
WRF2011.
More than 400 participants from over 40 countries and international organisations attended the World Resources Forum 2011 in Davos, Switzerland, from 19–21 September 2011, and exchanged their views and perspectives on best practices, policy options and research on natural resource management and promoting and implementing a Green Economy. Results were documented in a chairman's summary, meeting report and were submitted to the Rio+20 Earth Summit's compilation document, as well as other stakeholders, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Swiss government adopted the recommendations and integrated these in their statements in Rio.
WRF2009.
The R'09 conference on resource management and technology for material and energy efficiency was run simultaneously in Davos and Nagoya from 14 to 16 September 2009. The main goal of the ninth event in the R' World Congress series was to promote technologies and frameworks for enhancing the material and energy efficiency of products, services and processes (from production and use to recycling), including developing sustainable solutions for tackling the growing mountain of e-waste.
The conference was organized by Empa in cooperation with the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences (SATW), the EcoTopia Science Institute of the University of Nagoya, and the Factor 10 Institute. For the first time, that year's conference was followed by the World Resource Forum (WRF), where politicians and scientists had the opportunity to discuss new economic frameworks promoting the sustainable use of resources. The innovative two site conference concept saved considerable amounts of CO2, so the conclusion of a scientific paper, published in Elsevier's Telematics and Informatics Journal
At the Davos meeting, WRF attendees adopted a declaration that calls for western economies to massively reduce their material inputs and for the world to dramatically increase resource productivity. They also agreed that, because the price of natural resources is low compared to that of labour, industry will not purposely drive those changes. Only governments can provide the necessary framework and incentives.

Upper Rhine Railway Company

The Upper Rhine Railway Company (, OEG), formerly the "Oberrheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG" (Upper Rhine Railway Company Ltd), later "MVV OEG AG", later operated by "MVV Verkehr AG" (the operator of the Mannheim Tramway) and now part of Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr (Rhine-Neckar Transport), is a metre gauge railway between the three cities of Mannheim, Heidelberg and Weinheim. A small section of standard gauge line between Heidelberg and Schriesheim was used only for moving freight. It is known by the acronym of "OEG" of the original operating company. It is listed in the timetable of Deutsche Bahn as route 669 and forms part of the network that is administered by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN).
The OEG is a non-federally own railway, which was built under the German ESBO narrow gauge railway regulations and operates in Mannheim and Heidelberg as a tram. It operates partly on the tracks of the "MVV Verkehr AG" and the "Heidelberger Straßen- und Bergbahn AG" (the Heidelberg Tramway, HSB). Because the OEG uses trams, it is perceived as a tramway rather than as an Interurban. Until December 2009, the OEG also operated the city buses in Weinheim, some bus routes in the southeast of Mannheim and several other bus routes in the vicinity of Schriesheim and Ladenburg.
History.
Although Mannheim and Heidelberg were connected by the Rhine Valley Railway in 1840 and Weinheim was also connected by the Main-Neckar Railway in 1846, there were aspirations in the 1880s to build a narrow gauge railway to connect these three cities and the smaller places along the Neckar river and the Mountain Road. Specifically, the operator of the quarries in Schriesheim and Dossenheim wanted better facilities for the transport of freight as the Main-Neckar Railway bypassed the Mountain Road at this point.
In 1883, a company operating in the region as "Gebrüder Leferenz" (Leferenz Brothers) were granted the concession for a line from Heidelberg to Schriesheim, with a continuation to Weinheim. This could not be realised at that time for financial reasons.
The first years of operation.
In 1886, the "Centralverwaltung für Secundärbahnen Herrmann Bachstein" (Hermann Bachstein Branch Line Central Organisation) was awarded the concession for the line from Mannheim to Käfertal and Viernheim to Weinheim, which was opened as soon as 1887. The consortium acquired the concession of the Leferenz Brothers and opened the line from Weinheim along the Mountain Road via Lützelsachsen, Hohensachsen, Großsachsen, Leutershausen, Schriesheim, Dossenheim and Handschuhsheim to Heidelberg in 1890.
In 1891, the line was continued first from Heidelberg to Edingen and a few weeks later the remaining line was opened via Neckarhausen and Seckenheim to Mannheim.
Finally in 1892, the gap was closed between the two stations in Mannheim (the Weinheim station north of the Neckar and the Heidelberg station south of the Neckar). These were connected over the Friedrich Bridge (now the Kurpfalz Bridge), but the link was only used for internal operations.
Takeover by the SEG.
The Bachstein company was absorbed into the South German Railway Company ("Süddeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG", SEG), founded in 1895, which took over the operations of the "Mannheim-Weinheim-Heidelberg-Mannheimer Eisenbahn" (MWHME) in 1897.
In 1903, the line from Mannheim towards Käfertal and Käfertaler Straße and Mannheimer Straße on the former Kronprinzenstraße (now Friedrich-Ebert-Straße) was moved and the SEG has since run together with the urban trams to and from Käfertal. A section of the old line in Mannheimer Straße remained as a connecting track to the national railway (at Käfertal station on the eastern branch of the Ried Railway) until 1971.
To enable a direct connection to the Dossenheimer and Schriesheimer quarries, in 1906, a freight-only railway line was opened from Heidelberg SEG freight yard over its own bridge over the Neckar through the Neuenheimer Feld to Dossenheim and further on to Schriesheim, allowing freight trains to avoid running through central Heidelberg. This line was built as a dual gauge track, allowing metre gauge and standard gauge freight trains to run, with some stations and company sidings built only with standard gauge track.
The final extension of the line followed on 1 May 1909 with the connection from Käfertal via Wallstadt to Heddesheim. This was unpopular with the citizens of Wallstadt but had a cheaper fare and more frequent service and better connections to the city of Mannheim than the Mannheim tram that ended in nearby Feudenheim, so many people walked from Freudenheim to Wallstadt.
For many decades a branch line, which was opened in 1888, ran from Käfertal Wald station to Käfertaler waterworks. This siding was used to supply the water plant with coal, which was necessary for the operation of the steam-driven pumps.
The OEG era.
After the death of Hermann Bachstein in 1908, the Rhenish industrialist Hugo Stinnes took over the majority of SEG in1909 with the aim of taking control of the electric tramways of the Ruhr and other major cities as part of the RWE ("Rheinisch-Westfälisches Elektrizitätswerk AG") power company so that they could be connected to the electric grid of western Germany. In order to focus on electric trams, a few railways were spun off the SEG and transferred to newly established companies.
In order to carry out the electrification of the line and to allow the expansion of its tram network, the city of Mannheim in cooperation with the SEG, which had acquired the Mannheim-Weinheim-Heidelberg-Mannheim railway, founded the "Oberrheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG" (OEG) in 1911. In order to prevent domination by the RWE, the city of Mannheim held a majority of the shares of the company. The Schwetzingen–Ketsch Tramway ("Straßenbahn Schwetzingen–Ketsch") and two power plants in Ladenburg and Rheinau were acquired by the OEG. 51% of the share capital was held by the city of Mannheim and 26% by the SEG. The rest was accounted for by three other shareholders.
A target in the early days was an extension of the Mannheim–Weinheim line via Birkenau and Fürth to Reichelsheim with access to the SEG-owned Reinheim-Reichelsheim railway; this could not in the end be realised (the Weschnitz Valley Railway—"Weschnitztalbahn"—between Weinheim and Fürth is standard gauge). Nevertheless, in 1912, the line was relocated in Weinheim, including the construction of the OEG bridge over the Main-Neckar Railway. The old line ran from Stahlbad directly to the east—following the course of today's Breslauer Straße—to the freight yard, which was crossed by a bridge, then along the Mountain Road north to the Pfälzer Hof inn (at the site of the current town hall). The line built for the new OEG bridge was relocated to the route of today's Stahlbadstraße and Mannheimer Straße and the branch line from Bahnhofstraße to Pfälzer Hof was dismantled.
In 1913, the OEG tram route was opened from Neckarau to Rheinau (then called Rhenaniastraße). During the construction of the line, Rheinau was not yet incorporated in Mannheim, which according to existing cooperation agreements was in the jurisdiction of the OEG. With its incorporation in 1913 this changed, so the line was then run by the city's tramway and passed into its possession in 1921.
In 1914, the first section of the Mannheim–Feudenheim–Ilvesheim–Ladenburg–Schriesheim line was opened to Feudenheim for temporary freight traffic. In addition, the line was operated for two months by the city’s tram services, prior to the commencement of OEG operations. Land on the adjacent section had been purchased and works had commenced (including on bridges) on the remaining route, but work had to be abandoned because of the First World War. Since the building could not be completed even after the war for economic reasons, the OEG began operating its first bus line on the route in 1925. It was intended to be temporary, awaiting the finishing of the line, but it has continued to this day. The freight traffic to Freudenheim was abandoned along with the line in the late 1920s.
Electrification.
The first section to be electrified was the Käfertal–Viernheim–Weinheim section (which was duplicated at the same time), which was completed in 1915. The electrification of this line also meant that the OEG supplied the town of Weinheim with electricity until 1934. Simultaneously, the tracks of the municipal tramway in Mannheim lying to the north of the Neckar were electrified from the Mannheim station of the OEG ("Bahnhof Mannheim OEG" or "Weinheimer Bahnhof"), extending through Paradeplatz, Planken and Wasserturm to the forecourt of Mannheim Central Station. The original design of the contact wire, with the catenary completely warped with cross braces, remained between Käfertal and Viernheim until the integration of the OEG into the VRN.
The First World War delayed the first planned extension of the electrification. It was not until 1928 that the Mannheim–Seckenheim–Neckarhausen–Edingen line was electrified and the line between Mannheim and Seckenheim was duplicated. In Mannheim, a new station at the Kurpfalz bridge called "Bahnhof Mannheim-Kurpfalzbrücke" or "Heidelberger Bahnhof" (meaning the station on the line to Heidelberg) connected the tracks to the Mannheim tram network.
Some of the OEG-bound trains now ran on the Paradeplatz–Schloss–Bismarckstraße route to the forecourt of Mannheim Central Station (with a link through Tattersallstrasse to Bismarckstraße), but this link was closed in 1943 after devastating air raids by the Allies.
At the same time a direct, two-track, electrified line was built between Seckenheim and Wieblingen south of Edingen; this was about six kilometres shorter than the single-track line through Neckarhausen (which continued to be operated until 1969). The original Edingen–Wieblingen section was shut down at the same time. Together with the electrification and the new line, Edingen station was relocated to its present location and a new depot was built.
The Käfertal–Heddesheim branch line has been electrically operated since 1946 (it was electrified with material from the disused Feudenheim–Mannheim line).
The last section of the Weinheim–Heidelberg route was electrified between 1949 and 1956 in several sections. Electric trams were able to run around the whole circuit on 1 September 1956.
The OEG lines are electrified with direct current, initially at 1,200 volts, but at 750 volts since 1974. The vehicles are equipped to operate on the tramways in Mannheim and Heidelberg, which use a voltage of 600 volts, although in Heidelberg the polarity is reversed.
After the Second World War / first modernisation.
Like most transport companies in Germany, the OEG had a huge increase in ridership after the war to cope with, especially in 1945 when only half of its fleet was available. In 1947 patronage reached a peak of 25.6 million passengers. One of the reasons for the increase was the phenomenon of so-called “foraging trips”, when cheap fares encouraged people to barter for food with farmers. Ridership returned to normal after the currency reform of 1948.
After overcoming the post-war difficulties, the OEG had to deal with incipient mass motorisation. Its goal was to become faster and more convenient in order to hang on to patronage. A first step was the purchase of four open coaches, together with trailer carriages from Waggonfabrik Fuchs.
Also, the network was partly not up to date at it included the non-electrified single-track section along the Mountain Road from Handschuhsheim to Weinheim. It ran at grade along federal highway B 3 and was very accident prone as a result. Therefore, it was moved from 1952 to 1955 on to its own route. An exception to this day is in the built up area of Großsachsen. In 1952, a carriage shed was completed in Schriesheim, which then housed buses in addition to rail vehicles (until 1969).
The modernisation of the fleet was continued with the delivery from 1957 to 1963 of large carriages from Waggonfabrik Rastatt, including the OEG’s first articulated train sets in 1960. At the same time the improvement of the safety of level crossings began with the installation of flashing light systems; this equipment was later augmented with half-barriers.
In 1959, there was the extension of the concession for the railway operations. Due to appeals against its continued operation this was granted on a provisional basis only. Only in 1964 was the license reissued for passenger operations until 2009 and for freight until 1989.
In 1960, the local signal boxes began to be replaced by an automatic block signaling system. The first line to be modernised was from Mannheim to Seckenheim. In 1967, the Schriesheim–Handschuhsheim section was resignalled. In 1969, the whole line from Weinheim to Heidelberg was resignalled. By the end of the 1980s the entire route network had been equipped with automatic block signaling. Today, the lines are controlled by three signal boxes in Edingen, Schriesheim and Käfertal.
In 1966, the eight-axle articulated trams of DÜWAG was introduced to the OEG network, which continue to be the backbone of operations today.
In the 1960s, continuously welded rail began to be installed. The remaining semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals, which are easier to maintain.
In 1968, as part of the upgrade of the B 38, the line in Viernheim was moved slightly to the southeast. Up to that time the line ran to Kiesstraße curving next to Mannheimer Straße then turned right–approximately following the course of today's road called "Auf der Beune"–crossed Heddesheimer Straße and then ran just off Ringstraße (now called "Berliner Ring") to Viernheim OEG station. It thus run largely on what was then the outskirts. The newly built line, on the other hand, swings away from the Mannheimer Straße after Jahnstraße and runs past the former "beer cellar" and under the new Heddesheimer Straße bridge on an altered route to Viernheim OEG station. The community had negotiated for the line to be moved to this route as early as 1911, along with the construction of the Berliner Ring on the same route.
Viernheim Haltepunkt (“halt”) was moved as a result of this new construction from its previous location between Sandstraße and Kiesstraße to Jahnstraße. In 1972 it was transferred again to the west, however, this time to give access the newly opened "Rhein-Neckar-Zentrum" shopping mall. In the meantime, it was also renamed "Tivoli", as it is adjacent to the Viernheim district of Tivoli. "Kapellenberg" station, which has since been built further to the northeast on the new route, is now close to the original "Viernheim Haltepunkt".
Closures.
Because the Seckenheim–Neckarhausen–Edingen line was less used because of the direct line that was built in 1928/29, it was replaced by a bus route in 1969. The kilometre stones on the Neckar river embankment in Neckarhausen are still visible today.
Because of growing competition from road transport for freight, profitability fell significantly in the 1960s, so that the dual gauge freight line between Heidelberg and Schriesheim was closed in 1970 and in 1971 the carriage of freight was abandoned. An exception was the annual sugar beet harvest, which was transported using Rollbocks, which operated until 1983. Otherwise, the OEG operated freight traffic until the early 1990s using road transport.
Further modernisation.
The initially sections terminated in Mannheim at separate OEG stations on either side of the river Neckar near the Kurpfalz bridge. In 1973 the line from Weinheim was extended over the Friedrich-Ebert Bridge over the Neckar to Mannheim Central Station and the Weinheimer station was closed. The grounds of the former station are now used for part of the Neckar promenade, completed in 2006, and at almost the same location a new tram line has been opened along Schafweide.
The depot in Viernheim was closed in the mid-1970s. It was unnecessary, because the main workshop in Kafertal was closed for the establishment of the central transport workshop. Personnel and rolling stock were moved from Viernheim to Käfertal. On its grounds the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Eisenbahngeschichte (German Railway History Company, DGEG) operated a museum of narrow-gauge vehicles from 1976 to 1986. The listed building was in a poor state for a long time and was closed to the public since the removal of the historic OEG carriages. The sidings were removed and the sheds were cleaned up in 2008 and it was converted into an office complex in 2010.
In 1976, professional mobile radio was introduced. By 1977 the railway tracks in the Käfertal OEG station had been completely remodelled since at that time it was in the same condition that it had been when it was built before the First World War and therefore no longer met current requirements. A turning loop was created there. In 1980, Schriesheim station was adapted to the needs of the times and the carriage shed was converted into the central bus depot.
In 1982, the OEG acquired four train sets from the Bielefeld Stadtbahn, which each consisted of a six-axle motor carriage and a four-axle trailer. These one-way vehicles could be used only on the Mannheim Central Station–Käfertal–Heddesheim route because it was the only route with turning loops at its endpoints. This freed up railcars, which were urgently needed for the circular route, where the withdrawal of vehicles that were not suitable for one-man operations had created a bottleneck.
After planning began in 1983, the OEG opened a new route in Heidelberg in 1993: instead of using Bergheimer Straße, it now runs on the tram line along Kurfürstenanlage to Heidelberg Central Station. For this, a new track was built from the direction of Wieblingen, starting shortly before the former OEG freight yard, which was partially demolished at the same time, passing under the and Czerny bridge to the Central Station and connecting with the existing tram route.
In 1995, the concept of "MVG 2000" was implemented that also brought big changes for the OEG. Up to this time, trains coming from Weinheim terminated in the forecourt of the Mannheim Central Station and from Heidelberg in Mannheim Kurpfalz Bridge station ("Bahnhof Mannheim Kurpfalzbrücke"). The circuit was now closed with trains running through the centre of Mannheim. To achieve this, a short connecting line was built from the front of the "Collini-Center", bypassing the Kurpfalz bridge station branch and connecting to the tram line on Friedrichsring. This connection was a restoration; there had been a similar link until 1928 or 1974. The OEG was connected to the Mannheim tram network and now ran with the line designation of 5R (and 5 for trains running only on the Käfertal–Mannheim–Edingen section). Under the MVG concept, the route to Heddesheim became part of the tram network and was operated by "Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen GmbH" (VBL, Ludwigshafen Transport, the operator of the Ludwigshafen Tramway). Since then VBL, rather than OEG, has operated tram line 4 from Heddesheim to Ludwigshafen, Oggersheim and Bad Durkheim.
The OEG was thus connected to the two major Deutsche Bahn stations in Mannheim and Heidelberg within a few years.
In 1996, the distribution of the losses of the OEG were revised. Mannheim now contributes 58.2%, Rhein-Neckar-Kreis 30%, Heidelberg 7.2% and Viernheim 4.6% of the losses occurring every year. Until then, the city of Heidelberg had paid nothing at all.
In addition, in 1996, "Weinheimer Busunternehmen GmbH" (Weinheim Bus Company, WEBU) was established, owned by "Stadtwerke Weinheim GmbH" (the Weinheim municipal utility, 71.6%) and OEG (28.4%), that has since managed Weinheim city buses. OEG continued to operate bus services for WEBU until 31 December 2009.
In the 1990s, the Heidelberg–Schriesheim section was duplicated to allow better time-keeping. The duplication of the remaining section of the line between Schriesheim and Weinheim was carried out from March 2011 with a seven-month closure of the line with trains replaced by buses.
As a result of the upgrade of the OEG, it was integrated in June 1999 as a full line of the Heidelberg tram network. Have formerly only stopped been between Bismarckplatz and Handschuhsheim Nord at Burgstraße, Handschuhsheim OEG-Bahnhof and Kußmaulstraße, OEG trains has since served all stops (except for the Froschäckerweg stop, but this has now been closed) and replaced in this section tram line 1, which was previously operated by the Heidelberg Tramway (HSB). The Adenauerplatz stop between Bismarckplatz and Poststraße is not, however, served by OEG because of the short distance to the neighbouring stations operated by the OEG.
In 2000, MVV GmbH acquired a share of 94.6% of the OEG from the city of Mannheim and renamed the company MVV OEG AG. 5.18% remains directly owned by the city of Mannheim, 0.2% by the city Heidelberg and 0.02% by the city of Weinheim. Since 2002, the OEG network has been operated together with the Mannheim trams of "MVV Verkehr AG".
Transition to the RNV.
As of 1 October 2004, the "MVV OEG AG" and "MVV Verkehr AG", "Straßenbahn Heidelberg", "Verkehrsbetriebe Ludwigshafen" and Rhein-Haardtbahn jointly own Rhine-Neckar Transport ("Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr GmbH", RNV) and operations have been carried out jointly since 1 March 2005. The infrastructure and the concessions remain with the OEG, with the rolling stock going as part of the capital contribution to Rhine-Neckar Transport, which now provides transport services on behalf of the OEG. Since 2005, responsibility for losses incurred will be distributed to the respective districts of Mannheim, Heidelberg, Viernheim and the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis in proportion to net-kilometres operated. The council of the city of Mannheim decided in 2009 to merge MVV OEG AG and MVV Verkehr AG. After acquiring the remaining 0.22% of shares from Heidelberg and Weinheim, Mannheim now holds 100% of the shares. The merger was finalised on 16 March 2010 with the deletion of MVV OEG AG from the share register. As a next step, MVV Verkehr AG became a limited liability company on 31 March 2011.
Since the unification of the area of the RNV, the OEG service has operated as line number 5 since 10 December 2006.
In contrast to the upgrade of signalling carried out after the Second World War, all signalling is being centralised at a traffic control centre at the Mohlstrasse depot in Mannheim, which will cover all the operations of Rhine-Neckar Transport. The signalling is being converted to electronic interlocking technology. Since 10 April 2008, the Weinheim–Schriesheim–Handschuhsheim Nord section is controlled remotely. The Schriesheim dispatcher has since worked out of the RNV control centre at Mohlstrasse. On 10 March 2011, control of the Edingen signal box was also switched to the central control point, so that the signal box is now vacant.
Already the long planned modernisation of the nine kilometre long single-track line between Weinheim and Schriesheim began on 10 March 2010 with a symbolic groundbreaking ceremony. Here, the duplicated track will in future allow operations at 10-minute intervals. A major restructuring of operations was required by the full closure of this section of track. Between 21 March 2011 and 5 November 2011, all trains on the section between Weinheim OEG station and Schriesheim station were replaced by buses, resulting in most cases in a significant extension of travel time. Weinheim OEG station was rebuilt during the summer school holidays. The trains during this period ran through without stopping to the Händelstraße stop, which was equipped for this purpose with a temporary set of points connecting the tracks. Trains have run through again on the now double-track line since 5 November. Only two short sections in the thoroughfares of Großsachsen and Schriesheim remain as single track. In the course of restructuring the entire Weinheim–Heidelberg route was equipped with a new electronic interlocking system. At the timetable change on 11 December 2011, the newly built Großsachsen Süd stop was also opened. The rebuilding of Schriesheim station should be completed by mid 2012.
Ticket-vending machines.
In the late 1960s, the OEG acquired the first in a series of 15 ticket machines. Accordingly, in 1969 and 1970, at first some trains, then all trains, operated without conductors. The OEG ordered a further 54 ticket machines, which were set up in 1973 and 1974. Thus the OEG was the one of the first non-federally owned railways with machines at stations as a prerequisite for one-man operations. In 1975, the majority of stations were equipped with ticket machines. Since 1 July 2005, tickets have only available at vending machines or as advance bookings. This is intended to reduce stopping times and to improve train punctuality. To date, however, not all stops have machines. One problem is the possibility of malfunctioning machines.
Operations.
Originally, the OEG had four independently-operated passenger lines:
After the completion of the electrification of the Mannheim–Heidelberg–Mannheim–Weinheim triangle of OEG lines in 1956, every second train of the trains bound for Weinheim continued to Heidelberg, creating the so-called "round trip" trains. From 1965 trains running from Mannheim to Heidelberg continued on the circuit, so since that time all trains have operated as round trips except for extra peak-hour trains.
As a result there was the following line network:
In 1995, the trains from Weinheim and Heidelberg continued through central Mannheim. Thus, the OEG trains have operated since then on a circuit, if they do not reverse at Edingen/Schriesheim or Käfertal/Weinheim. At the same time the line via Käfertal to Heddesheim is now operated as part of the extended tram line to Käfertal from Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim, operated by the MVV on behalf of the OEG.
The network from 1995 was as follows:
In 1995, the complete circuit was given the line number of 62 and the short service between Käfertal and Edingen was given the line number of 63 in VRN’s network-wide scheme. Since the MVV in Mannheim, however, used the designation of 5 for the OEG in its Stadtbahn network, after some time the route numbers were changed to 5R (instead of 62) for the entire circuit and 5 (instead of 63) for the short service between Käfertal and Edingen. In the timetable of the VRN the route was listed under the table numbered "R 65". The distinction between 5 and 5R was finally abandoned in late 2006 and since then only the number 5 has been used, which is now used for the table number in the timetable.
The course of the OEG circuit in the city of Mannheim resembles the figure"8" with the line intersecting on the south bank of the Neckar River (at the Friedrich-Ebert Bridge), but there are no stops allowing a change of trains at this barely perceptible intersection.
This complete circuit is particularly demanding in terms of reliability and punctuality, neither delayed nor early services are welcome. The OEG does not yet have any passing tracks in Mannheim or in Heidelberg, where it has no allowances for recovery time in its timetable, as this would disturb tram traffic. This means that the OEG rail operations at times have significant and repeated irregularities: a delay of ten minutes or more frequently occur at certain times of the day. Scheduled connections are often not achieved. The OEG therefore now has more allowances for recovery time in its timetables at Schriesheim, Edingen and Käfertal, but the standing time of the trains, especially if these stations are halfway on passenger’s journeys is disturbing.
The OEG operates with bidirectional vehicles at both ends of the sets and need no turning loops. The OEG is the only line in Mannheim with this characteristic, while at the tramway at Heidelberg has been a consistently bi-directional operation since 1974.

El Paso Stanton Street Port of Entry

The El Paso Stanton Street Port of Entry, located at the Good Neighbor International Bridge is limited to processing passenger vehicles that are enrolled in the SENTRI program. It is open from 6:00 AM - midnight weekdays, and 8:00 AM - midnight Saturdays and Sundays.
Since its reconstruction in 1967 as part of the Chamizal Treaty between the US and Mexico, the Good Neighbor International Bridge (known locally as the Stanton Street Bridge) was dedicated to southbound traffic. In 1998, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Customs Service chose this bridge as the best location to set up a dedicated commuter lane to relieve congestion in the busy El Paso-Cuidad Juarez metroplex. The General Services Administration constructed a port of entry on available land just west of the bridge and it was opened to pre-enrolled northbound traffic in September 1999.

Cecil Lyster

Cecil Rupert Chaworth Lyster CBE (14 December 1859 – 26 January 1920) was a British physician, electrotherapist and radiologist.
Lyster was the son of Alfred Chaworth Lyster and his wife Elizabeth (née Kennett). He began his career as resident medical officer at Charing Cross Hospital in London and then served as resident obstetrical officer from 1881 to 1882. Following travels in the United States and Europe, he was appointed medical superintendent of the Bolingbroke Hospital in 1885. Specialising in electro-therapeutics and radiology, he became medical officer-in-charge of the Electrical Department of Middlesex Hospital in 1902, while still continuing to work as a doctor at the Bolingbroke Hospital. He held these positions until his death.
Lyster was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920 for his work in the First World War. He married Edith Thompson (died 1919) in 1903; they had no children. Lyster died from cancer caused by exposure to x-rays during his research, the day before his CBE was gazetted. The gazette was later ante-dated to two days before his death.

Ouvertüre zum &quot;Fliegenden Holländer&quot;, wie sie eine schlechte Kurkapelle morgens um 7 am Brunnen vom Blatt spielt

Ouvertüre zum „Fliegenden Holländer“, wie sie eine schlechte Kurkapelle morgens um 7 am Brunnen vom Blatt spielt (Overture to the "Flying Dutchman" as Sight-read by a Bad Spa Orchestra at 7 in the Morning by the Well) is a musical parody for string quartet by Paul Hindemith, based on the overture to "The Flying Dutchman" by Richard Wagner. The piece dates to c. 1925 and in performance lasts approximately eight minutes.
Background.
In his youth, Hindemith supplemented the family income by performing at dances, inns, and in cinema, operetta, and spa orchestras. Later, his sense of humour occasioned numerous parody pieces, dramatic, instrumental, and vocal. These include a "Gouda-Emmental March" ("Gouda-Emmental Marsch"; 1920; lost); "The atonal cabaret" ("Das atonale cabaret"; 1921; lost); "Song in the style of Richard Strauss" ("Lied 'im Stile Richard Strauss'"; c. 1925), with text from the journal "Bees and how to keep them"; and "The Expiring Frog" ("Recitative e aria ranatica"; 1944), inspired by "Encyclopædia Britannica" and Charles Dickens. In 1920 he wrote to Schott, his publisher, "Can you make use of foxtrot, Boston, rags and other kitsch? When I can think of no decent music, I write such things." His failure to arrange publication explains the loss of many of these works.
Music.
As might be expected from the title, the composition sees Wagner's overture mangled. Yet all the errors, the playing out of tune, rhythmic imprecision, and interpretative deficiencies to which such an ensemble upon such an occasion might be prone are "written out meticulously", demanding great technical proficiency in execution, even if the end result is "pitiful". From bar 261 the piece dissolves into a waltz (part of "Les Patineurs" by Waldteufel), before returning to Wagner and closing with a shimmering finale. It is not clear whether Hindemith is satirizing Wagner, incompetent performers, "ostentatiously dissonant composers", or the introduction of popular elements into serious music. Regardless, according to the American music scholar Daniel Albright, of all the reworkings of "The Flying Dutchman" in twentieth-century music, this is "the most explicitly amusing".
Recordings.
Recordings include those by the Buchberger Quartett (WER 6197-2); Kocian Quartet (PR 250 093 94); Leipziger Streichquartett (MDG 307 1362-2); and the Solistes de l'Opéra National de Paris (UT3-005). The score and parts are published by Schott (ISMN: 979-0-001-08328-7).

Academic theater is an honorary title awarded to the biggest and oldest state theaters. Established in the Soviet Russia, it was adopted by the Soviet Union. Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union the title was adopted by the former country members of the Union.
The title was established in 1919 and was given to six oldest theaters of the Soviet Union: Bolshoi Theatre, Maly Theatre, Moscow Art Theatre, Alexandrinsky Theatre, Mariinsky Theatre, and Mikhaylovsky Theatre. All academic theaters in 1920 were organized into one association that existed only for a year. During the 1920s, 1930s the number of theaters with the title increased significantly.

Chemisches Zentralblatt

Chemisches Zentralblatt is the first and oldest abstracts journal published in the field of chemistry. It covers the chemical literature from 1830 to 1969 and describes therefore the “birth” of chemistry as science, in contrast to alchemy. The information contained in this German journal is comparable with the content of the leading source of chemical information Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), which started publishing abstracts in English in 1907.
"Chemisches Zentralblatt" was originally founded as "Pharmaceutisches Centralblatt" by Gustav Theodor Fechner and published by Leopold Voß in Leipzig in 1830. In the first year, 544 pages containing 400 abstracts were published, reporting all relevant research results in pharmaceutical chemistry. In the following 20 years the relevance of chemistry grew so much that in 1850 the title changed in "Chemisch-Pharmazeutisch Zentralblatt", and in 1856 it became "Chemisches Zentralblatt". In 1969, after 140 years the expenses for the collection of primary literature in many languages and the production of abstracts were too high and the publication of "Chemisches Zentralblatt ceased".
In these 140 years, scientific editors reported research progresses in chemistry with approximately 2 million abstracts, publishing over 650,000 pages. Additional 180,000 pages contain indexes such as index of authors, subject indexes, general indexes, register of patents, and formula register.
"Chemisches Zentralblatt" was completely digitized by "FIZ Chemie" in Berlin. "FIZ Chemie" scanned the entire work and developed a full text searchable database for the web. In addition the database can be purchased and integrated in Intranets. The chemical software company InfoChem, based in Munich, developed an Internet-based database, the "Chemisches Zentralblatt" Structural Database. This database provides access to the chemical content within the "Chemisches Zentralblatt" by performing chemical structure and substructure searches.

Isaiah Wilkerson

Isaiah Jamal Wilkerson (born November 13, 1990) is American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA D-League. He finished his collegiate career in 2011–12 as the Great West Conference Player of the Year. He became the first player from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) to win the player of the year award and only the third overall winner in Great West history.
High school.
Wilkerson was born in Staten Island, New York to parents Beaun and Linda Wilkerson. He attended Curtis High School where he starred on the basketball team. As a senior in 2007–08, he helped lead Curtis to a school-record 25 win season (including a 14–0 mark in conference play). The "New York Daily News" named him to their First Team All-Staten Island group after Wilkerson averaged 16.6 points per game. He scored 20 or more points in seven different games including two 24-point performances.
College.
Wilkerson did not enroll at NJIT immediately to play for the Highlanders. It was not until the second semester that he became a student, so his first career game on December 20, 2008 came without the benefit of having a single practice yet with the team. In 22 games that season he averaged 12.5 points and 3.5 rebounds. The following year, he scored in double figures 22 times while averaging 13.0 points and 4.9 rebounds per game. Wilkerson was named an honorable mention for the All-Great West Conference team. In his junior season in 2010–11 he once again creased his averages to 13.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, leading NJIT in both statistical categories, and was named All-Great West First Team. The Highlanders finished in second place with a 9–3 conference record. The following year—Wilkerson's last—saw him average career-highs of 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. The Highlanders made it to the championship game of the Great West Conference Tournament but lost to North Dakota, 75 to 60. He was then named the conference player of the year. Wilkerson was also the only men's basketball player from any of the eight New Jersey NCAA Division I schools to be named to an All-American team, which the Associated Press did when he was put on the honorable mention squad.
For his career, Wilkerson scored 1,577 points and grabbed 616 rebounds; the rebounding total is the NJIT program record for their Division I era. His point total had been NJIT's all-time scoring mark in the Division I era at the time of his graduation, but the following season, former teammate Chris Flores surpassed him as the school's all-time leading scorer.
Professional.
In November 2012, Wilkerson was acquired by the Tulsa 66ers for the 2012–13 season. In November 2013, he was re-acquired by the 66ers.

Aarberg Castle

Aarberg Castle () is a castle in the municipality of Aarberg in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.
History.
While the builder of the castle is unknown, the city itself was founded between 1220 and 1225 by count Ulrich III of Neuchâtel. The count had recently acquired the rulership over this region and needed a central location from which to rule. The island and the key bridge was a natural location for a town. The castle may have been built around the time of the founding of the city. 
The city was besieged in 1339, 1382 and 1386 but not taken. In 1358 the Graf (or Count) Peter von Aarberg was in financial difficulties and began looking for someone to buy the city. After years of unsuccessful attempts, in 1377-79 he was able to sell the city and his rights as ruler to Bern. The Bernese bailiff took up residence in Aarberg Castle in 1379. In 1380, the old castle roof was replaced with a new shingle roof. In 1419 and again in 1477, the town and castle of Aarberg were nearly destroyed in a fire. Both the town and castle were rebuilt following the destructive fires.

St John's Church, St John's in the Vale

St John's Church, St John's in the Vale, is in the valley of St John's in the Vale, Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Derwent, the archdeaconry of West Cumberland, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Mary, Threlkeld, and Wythburn Church. The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.
History.
The church was built in 1845, replacing an earlier church, and re-using some of its fabric. The interior was reordered in 1893 by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. Some of the fittings currently present in the church result from this reordering.
Architecture.
St John's is constructed in slate and igneous rock, with some galleting. It is roofed with green slate. The plan is simple, consisting of a six-bay nave and chancel in one range, a small west tower, and a north porch. The windows along the sides of the church have two lights, and the east window has three lights. The tower has twin bell openings, and a battlemented parapet.
Inside the church is an open timber roof. The altar was designed by George Gilbert Scott, and was moved here from Crosthwaite Parish Church in 1848. Panelling in the church, formerly from box pews in Crosthwaite Church, was moved here in 1893. The pulpit, its sounding board, and the sanctuary rails date from the 18th century, and also came from another church. Also in the church are carved Royal arms of George III, and memorial tablets dated 1774 and 1853. The stained glass in the east window dates from 1895 and was made by Shrigley and Hunt

23 July 2012 Iraq attacks

The 23 July 2012 Iraq attacks were a series of simultaneous, coordinated bombings and shootings that struck the Iraqi security force and Shi'ite Muslim communities. At least 116 people were killed and 299 wounded in the attacks, making them the deadliest attacks in the country since May 2010. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the attacks. 
Background.
The attacks occurred about seven months following the withdrawal of the United States military forces from the area, leaving the security of the country in the hands of the Iraqi security forces.
Attacks.
Numerous attacks were conducted within hours of each other on 23 July 2012 across thirteen different cities in Iraq. Naharnet reported the number of towns and cities attacked as eighteen. The number of attacks, on the other hand, was given to be thirty. Two more attacks occurred late on 23 July 2012, increasing the number of attacks to thirty-two. Rod Nordland stated that the number of attacks was forty. The major targets of the attacks were security forces, government buildings and Shia Muslim neighbourhoods.
The first attack took place on an army base in Salahedin province around dawn. In Taji, nearly north of Baghdad, a series of bombs around a number of homes went off simultaneously; as police arrived and residents began searching the wreckage for survivors, a suicide bomber detonated himself, killing more. At least 41 people were killed in this attack, considered the worst of the overall event. A car bomb exploded near a government building in Sadr City in Baghdad, killing 16. At least five car bombs went off in Kirkuk. The insurgents attacked a base in Dhuluiya, killing 15 soldiers. In al-Husseiniya, a predominantly Shiite suburb in northeastern Baghdad and in Mosul, a total of six people were killed in bombing attacks. Explosion in Yarmouk, another neighborhood of Baghdad, killed at least four people and injured another 24. Nearly five people were also killed and 22 or 25 injured when a car bomb exploded near a busy market in Diwaniya. Of all the sites attacked, only Diwaniya is an undisputed Shiite territory. There were checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in the ethnically mixed Diyala Province, resulting in 11 dead and 40 wounded. In the western city of Heet, a car bombing occurred near an army patrol, killing one soldier and injuring 10 others. The other towns and cities suffered from bombings were Saadiya, Khan Beni-Saad, Tuz Khurmatu, Dibis, Samarra and Dujail.
In addition to all these attacks took place daytime, there were two more attacks late in the day. One of these attacks was a car bomb blast near a café in the Shi'ite Ameen district in southeastern Baghdad, killing six men and wounding 24. The second was a roadside bombing near Baquba, a city northeast of Baghdad. The second blast killed three people and injured seven others.
Perpetrators.
Though no group claimed responsibility immediately after the killings, the attacks were believed by Iraqi officials, media and specialists to be orchestrated by Al Qaeda, seeking to gain control of the country following the departure of the American forces. An announcement purported to be from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had been broadcast on 21 July 2012; in the announcement, al-Baghdadi declared the intention towards a new offensive to retake the country, a move claimed to be supported by the Sunni population of Iraq. Previous attacks that have targeted the security forces have been attributed to al-Qaeda.
On 25 July 2012, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a statement on radical Islamist websites, indicating that it was responsible for the recent attacks, calling the attacks "Destroying the Walls" campaign. ISI also stated that it was just the start of a "new stage of jihad".

TauD protein domain

In molecular biology, TauD refers to a protein domain that in many enteric bacteria is used to break down taurine (2-aminoethanesulphonic acid) as a source of sulphur under stress conditions. In essence, they are domains found in enzymes that provide bacteria with an important nutrient.
Function.
This protein family consists of TauD/TfdA taurine catabolism dioxygenases. The "Escherichia coli" tauD gene is required for the utilization of taurine (2-aminoethanesulphonic acid) as a sulphur source and is expressed only under conditions of sulphate starvation. TauD is an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase catalyzing the oxygenolytic release of sulphite from taurine. The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase from "Burkholderia sp." (strain RASC) also belongs to this family. TfdA from "Ralstonia eutropha" (Alcaligenes eutrophus) is a 2,4-D monooxygenase.

No Rent Manifesto

The No Rent Manifesto (18 October 1881), was a document issued in Ireland, by imprisoned leaders of the Irish Land League calling for a campaign of passive resistance by the entire population of small tenant farmers, by withholding rents to obtain large rent abatements under the second 1881 Irish Land Act. The intention being to "put the Act to the test" and prove its inadequacy to provide for the core demands of the tenants – the 'three Fs' of fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale – as well as providing sufficient funds for occupier purchase.
Land War origins.
Following the Irish Famine Irish politics lacked direction. Only with the formation of the Home Rule Party in 1870 under its founder Isaac Butt did a Nationalist movement begin to form, albeit with a vague policy of self-government for Ireland. While it won support from the majority of nationalists it lacked the dynamism needed to gain widespread support. Most Irish people, particularly tenant farmers, were more concerned with everyday needs. In the second half of the 1870s crop failures caused serious hardships. Wages fell and evictions were on the increase. Tenants began to demand rent abatements. This marked the beginning of the Land War in 1879 which lasted until 1882.
Land League emergence.
The short comings of the Home Rule Party brought a young ascendancy landlord, and MP for Meath, Charles Stewart Parnell into the foreground, who was all too aware of its shortcomings. In contrast to Butt, he was of a more militant nature. In the House of Commons he was considered a radical 'obstructionalist'. 
Following discussions with the Fenians John Devoy and Michael Davitt in June 1879, he launched the New Departure to fuse land agitation with the Home Rule movement. This was followed in October 1879 by the foundation of the Irish Nationalist Land League at a meeting in County Mayo where Parnell was elected president of the League. Andrew Kettle, Michael Davitt, and Thomas Brennan were appointed as honorary secretaries. The Land League united the different strands of land agitation and tenant rights movements under a single organisation. The government had introduced the first ineffective , followed by the equally lacking Acts of 1880 and 1881. Parnell, although close to advanced nationalists and land reform, carefully retained his constitutional credentials in London.
Land League banned.
But now in 1881 Parnell decided to move towards direct confrontation with the government. The prime minister William Ewart Gladstone had made a considerable advance with his second Land Act to meet Irish demands. But the crucial faults of the Act were that it left the definition of a fair rent to the discretion of the Land Court judges, and that those in rent-arrears were denied recourse to the fair-rent clause. For Davitt, no rent was the only fair rent.
The support newspaper of the Land League, "The United Ireland" edited by William O'Brien was quick to expose the short comings of the act. Parnell and O'Brien were convinced of the need to stem the flock of tenants, urged by the clergy, seeking rent abatement in the courts, as they were certain that the act would leave most of the rents unchanged. Together with all of his party lieutenants Parnell went into a bitter verbal offensive against the act, urging tenants to withhold rents.
Gladstone's cabinet decided "to transmute Parnell, by imprisonment, into a symbol of the Irish nation" where he was interned under the Irish Coercion Act in Kilmainham Jail on 12 October for "sabotaging the Land Act". Two days later the Land League was banned. Several other members of the party joined their leader in Kilmainham jail. O'Brien followed three days later, having been guilty with his publication of "treasonable practices".
No Rent Manifesto.
At this point Parnell decided it was the time to launch a "no-rent" campaign in Ireland. He chose the new jail arrival to draft such a plan with the words "O'Brien, of all the men in the world, you are the man we wanted" tasking him to draft a "No Rent Manifesto". It appeared on the front page of the "United Ireland" on 22 October, and published abroad in the New York Times. It bore the signatures of the League executive board, Dillon only signing reluctantly. Davitt's name was added because he was in jail in England, which he disapproved of, saying the action was eight months too late. O'Brien's text read as follows:
‘FELLOW-CITIZENS: The hour to try your souls and to redeem your pledges has arrived. The executive of the National Land League, forced to abandon its policy of testing the Land act, feels bound to advise the tenant farmers of Ireland from this day forth to pay no rents under any circumstances to their landlords until Government relinquishes the existing system of terrorism and restores the constitutional rights of the people. Do not be daunted by the removal of your leaders. Do not let yourselves be intimidated by threats of military violence. It is as lawful to refuse to pay rents as it is to receive them. Against the passive resistance of the entire population military power has no weapon. Funds will be poured out unstintedly for the support of all who may endure eviction in the course of the struggle. Our exiled brothers in America may be relied upon to contribute, if necessary, as many millions of money as they have contributed thousands to starve out landlordism and bring English tyranny to its knees. You have only to show that you are not unworthy of their boundless sacrifices. One more crowning struggle for your land, your homes, your lives – a struggle in which you have all the memories of your race, all the hopes of your kindred and all the sacrifices of your imprisoned brothers.
One more struggle in which you have the hope of happy homes and national freedom to inspire you, one more heroic effort to destroy landlordism, and the system which was and is the curse of your race will have disappeared forever. Stand together in face of the brutal, cowardly enemies of your race! Pay no rent under any pretext! Stand passively, firmly, fearlessly by, while the armies of England may be engaged in their hopeless struggle against the spirit which their weapons cannot touch, and the Government, with its bayonets, will learn in a single Winter how powerless are armed forces against the will of a united, determined, and self-reliant nation.
Kilmainham Treaty.
The Irish Hierarchy, especially the Archbishops Edward MacCabe of Dublin and Thomas Croke of Cashel, condemned the document outright, as did the "Freeman's Journal" and "The Nation", both opposing Parnell's tactics. Against such an outcry O'Brien's suppressed "United Ireland", now published in London and Paris, which he edited from his prison cell, had little chance of arousing national support for the campaign, which eventually largely failed its objective.
Outrages on the land increased significantly, so that by the spring Gladstone decided to negotiate directly with Parnell, resulting in the "Kilmainham Treaty" of 25 April 1882, whereby the government agreed to expand the 1881 Act to cover tenant farmers in arrears and to phase out coercion. Parnell in return agreed to withdraw the manifesto and bring violence to an end. The arrangement was unpopular with radicals as it resulted in a decisive shift away from radical land reform to a mainly constitutional movement for Home Rule.

TCP protein domain

In molecular biology, the protein domain TCP is actually a family of transcription factors named after: teosinte branched 1 (tb1, "Zea mays" (Maize)), cycloidea (cyc) ("Antirrhinum majus") (Garden snapdragon) and PCF in rice ("Oryza sativa").
Function.
Members of the TCP protein domain family appear to be involved in cell proliferation. It may also have a role in signalling pathways since it has three phosphorylation sites. The TCP domain is necessary for specific binding to promoter elements of the Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene and also in DNA binding.
Evolution.
This family of transcription factors are exclusive to higher plants. They can be divided into two groups, TCP-C and TCP-P, that appear to have separated following an early gene duplication event. This duplication event may have led to functional divergence and it has been proposed that that the TCP-P subfamily are transcriptional repressors, while the TPC-C subfamily are transcription activators.
Structure.
The TCP proteins code for structurally related proteins implicated in the evolution of key morphological traits. However, the biochemical function of CYC and TB1 proteins remains to be demonstrated. One of the conserved regions is predicted to form a non-canonical basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) structure. This domain is also found in two rice DNA-binding proteins, PCF1 and PCF2, where it has been shown to be involved in DNA-binding and dimerization.

Mannus Franken

Mannus Franken (2 February 1899 – 1 August 1953) was a Dutch filmmaker who played an important role in the development of Indonesian cinema. He made his debut as a writer before working with Joris Ivens in producing two documentary films. In 1934 he was called to the Dutch East Indies by Albert Balink to help with the production of "Pareh" (1936). Franken stayed in the Indies until before World War II, making newsreels. After the war he returned to the country and continued this work. In 1949 Franken returned to the Netherlands, where he made another film before his death.
Biography.
Franken was born on 2 February 1899 in Deventer, the Netherlands. As a youth he worked as a writer-cum-director before moving to Paris in 1925; in Paris he wrote on the experimental films being produced in France, and in 1928 he directed the stageplay "D 16 Mensch en Machine" ("D 16 Man and Machine"), based on the story "Donogoo Tonka" by Jules Romains.
The following year, working with Joris Ivens, Franken directed the shorts "Regen" ("Rain") and "Branding". Around this time he made another short, entitled "Jardin du Luxembourg" ("Garden of Luxembourg"), and during the early 1930s he directed several other films. Also in the early 1930s he was active in the Netherlands as a member of the Filmliga, a Dutch cinema club (1927–1933) founded by Menno ter Braak and Henrik Scholte, and as the chairman of the Association for Educational and Development Films; with the Amsterdam Liga he ran the De Uitkijk Theatre.
Franken, with Dutch-Indonesian journalist and filmmaker Albert Balink and the ethnic Chinese Wong brothers, started the production company Java Pacific Film in the 1930s in what was then the Dutch East Indies, which produced "Pareh" (1936), an ethnographic film considered a forerunner for the "Indonesia Indah" films. Balink had brought Franken to the country to ensure its artistic quality. Franken helped with the cinematography and screenwriting and, for greater commercial viability, was given top billing. However, the film was a commercial flop and bankrupted its producers, including Franken.
While making these feature films he also worked with the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF), owned by Balink, and directed newsreels. During this time Franken may have been involved in the production of "Terang Boelan", a feature film directed by Balink. The Indonesian historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Franken was not involved as "Terang Boelan" involved less ethnographic work, while the American film scholar Karl G. Heider writes that Franken co-directed the film. In 1938 Franken directed the semi-documentary film "Tanah Sabrang", based on the writiings of Adrian Jonkers and promoting emigration from Java to Sumatra. By the time World War II broke out Franken was already in the Netherlands; ANIF had closed in 1940.
After the war, Franken returned to the Indies – since proclaimed an independent nation named Indonesia – to make films for the Netherlands Government Information Service (). Franken returned to the Netherlands in 1949, producing a film for the government. He died on 1 August 1953 in Lochem.
Legacy.
On Franken's death, an obituary in "De Telegraaf" stated that he was a pioneering documentary filmmaker for the Netherlands and one of the country's few "avant-garde" creative professionals. The film historian Peter Cowie writes that Franken was underrated and "a true pioneer and a very real pillar of the documentary achievement usually credited solely to Joris Ivens". Heider considers "Pareh" and "Terang Boelan" the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s.
The Mannus Franken Foundation, which aims to preserve Franken's legacy, was established in 1979.

No. 18 Squadron IAF

No. 18 Squadron ("Flying Bullets"), is a Ground-attack unit of the Indian Air Force, flying from AFS Kalaikunda.
History.
The Squadron was formed on 15 April 1965, with five Folland Gnats and eleven pilots. Though it existed during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, it didn't participate in it official. A few pilots from this squadron flew operations with 9 Squadron, and 2 Squadron. Squadron Leader K.L. Khanna, was awarded the Vayu Sena Medal during the war.
The squadron first saw action during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, with the task of defending Kashmir Valley. It operated out of AFS Srinagar, consisting of four aircraft, 17 officers and 72 men commanded by Wing Commander P Raina. On 4 December, it scrambled to intercept an approaching raid. The raid was never carried out however, but the squadron kept flying Combat Air Patrols all day.
It fought its first dogfight, on 6 December, where Flight Lt. Bopaya and Squadron Leader Pathania got on the tail of four Sabres, despite heavy Anti-aircraft fire. Bopaya realised that both he and Pathania were tailing the same Sabre, so he broke off and chased another, though he failed to damage any. Pathania managed to damage one of the Sabres, but his gun jammed and he failed to shoot down the plane. The Sabres managed to damage the Srinagar runway, and the pair of fighters were forced to land. On the same day Flight Lt. B.S. Ghuman, and Flying Officer R.V. Padkhe escorted Vampires into Hajira and destroyed a Brigade HQ. Flight Lt. Naliyan and Flying Officer V.K. Sharma flew their squadron's first mission into enemy territory, in the Poonch sector, escort Vampires on their bombing raids successfully.
On 7 December, Bopaya and Flying Officer N.J.S. Sekhon escorted another raid into the Poonch sector, and strafed enemy positions after the Vampires had delivered their weapons. On the 8th, Raina and Ghuman escorted another raid into Kargil, and strafed enemy bunkers after the bombs were delivered.
On 14 December, no patrols had taken place due to poor visibility. On seeing enemy Sabres in the sky, Ghuman and Sekhon were scrambled, without any Air Traffic Controller clearance. The Sabres successfully bombed the runway and turned back. Sekhon chased them and moved out of sight of the of Ghuman and the ground controllers. One Sabre was seen going out of control in the sky, but while Sekhon chased the second, a third Sabre shot him down. His parachute failed to deploy, and he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
After the war, in February 1975, the Gnats were phased out, and replaced by HAL Ajeets. In May 1989, when the squdron was at Hindon, they were replaced with MiG 27s. Its former role of Air Defence was changed to Ground-attack.
Current Aircraft.
The squadron currently operates MiG 27s from AFS Kalaikunda.

Mike Lynn

Michael Lynn, III (May 18, 1936 – July 21, 2012) was an American football general manager and executive. He served as the general manager of the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings from 1975 to 1990.
Memphis.
Prior to a career in sports, Lynn managed movie theaters in Memphis, Tennessee. From 1966 to 1974 he was President of Mid South Sports, Inc., a group that sought to acquire a National Football League franchise for Memphis. Lynn also served as President of the Memphis Pros of the American Basketball Association in 1972.
Minnesota Vikings.
In 1974, Lynn was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as an assistant to the owner. He was named general manager in 1975 by then Vikings owner Max Winter following the departure of GM Jim Finks. Lynn led the Vikings to one Super Bowl and four Division Championship in his first four years with the team. In 1989, thinking that the Vikings were a big-time running back away from being a great team, he dealt what eventually turned into 5 players and 8 draft picks to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for running back Herschel Walker. The three 1st round and three 2nd round picks eventually netted the Cowboys Emmitt Smith, Darren Woodson, and Russell Maryland and three Super Bowl rings. On the Vikings' side, Walker gained 148 yards rushing on 18 carries in his first game, but averaged less than 81 yards a game for the other 26 games.
WLAF.
In 1990, Lynn was named president of the World League of American Football. He resigned as Vikings general manager, but retained his position as executive vice president. Lynn resigned as WLAF president on August 3, 1991 after less than one year on the job.
Return to Vikings.
In December 1991, a group aligned with Lynn purchased the shares of feuding Vikings minority partners Irwin L. Jacobs and Carl Pohlad. Two months later his 10% stake in the team was purchased by the club's nine other partners.
Death.
He died July 21, 2012 in Memphis, Tennessee, leaving behind his wife Jorja and four children.

<doc id="36523217" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36523217" title="Autotheism (album)">
Autotheism (album)

Autotheism is the third studio album by American technical death metal band The Faceless. It was released on August 14, 2012 through Sumerian Records. The album debuted at number 50 on the Billboard 200, number 3 on the Top Hard Rock Albums, number 13 on the Top Independent albums, number 18 on Top Rock albums, and hit number 1 on the CMJ radio loud rock chart.
Recording and Production.
The record was recorded at Keene's home studio in Los Angeles over the fall and summer of 2012. Preproduction versions of almost every song had been previously recorded by Keene throughout 2011, along with an additional song which ultimately was not used for the record. Keene noted that this track was better suited for his solo project and that the song would eventually see the light of day under that project name. Some of the guitar tracking for the preproduction captured a natural, raw quality and ended up being used in the final album versions of the songs. Keene approached the recording of Autotheism differently than previous records. All guitar and bass was recorded direct and drums were tracked live right in Keene's living room. Keene states that 7 different guitars were used to achieve the broad array of tones heard, including his neon green Washburn WM526, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul, a Bernie Rico Jr, as well as a chambered guitar made of carbon fiber.
Evan Brewer debuted the use of fretless bass in The Faceless on two tracks on a whim of experimentation in the studio. Keene also explored a more industrial influence, creating "post-apocalyptic" percussion sequences on many of the tracks. This played a big part in giving the record its distinctly dark quality. Another key quality of Autotheism came from Keene's time spent on experimenting with string arrangements and keyboard sequencing.
The lyrics were written largely in the studio. A process that Keene and Ficco described as "grueling, but rewarding". An outline for the story of the lyrics was written, followed by the individual topics for each song. Then, Keene and Ficco worked out the lyrics and phrasing as they went along with the recording process. "The bulk of the time was spent on the writing of the lyrics and phrasing. Once that part was complete, the actual recording flew by. Geoff is an exceptionally easy vocalist to record and produce" said Keene.
A guest appearance by Keene's long time friend and infamous youtube sensation Sergio "The Sexy Sax Man" Flores appears on the track "Deconsecrate". Keene's mother also contributes harmonizing background vocals on the track "Emancipate".
Theme.
Keene has stated in interviews that the name "Autotheism" derives from "auto" meaning self and "theism" meaning belief in God or gods, hence "autotheism" means "believing in one's self", or "being your own God". The album questions antiquated belief systems that are in play in current society. As well as touching upon religion, the album touches upon growth in technology at an exponential rate, the Holographic Universe theory, and science as a new religion, or alternatively, knowledge and reason as a reigning religion. Keene said in interviews that the inspiration for the album came partly from reading a book by Ray Kurzweil called The Singularity Is Near. The album also has an underlying theme of "Age of Reason" or "Renaissance"-esque discovery and ethics traits; alternatively, "starting over" or massively rethinking the way current systems are run. The album artwork, as well as the music and lyrics, intuitively portray this vibe.

Harold Blackburn (pioneer aviator)

Wing Commander Harold Blackburn, MC, AFC (19 January 1879 – 29 April 1959) was a British aviation pioneer. Blackburn was the first pilot to carry newspapers for commercial sale by air and on 22 July 1914 piloted the first scheduled airline service in Great Britain.
Biography.
Early life.
Born on 19 January 1879 in Dymock, Gloucestershire, Blackburn was the third child of Edwin Waller Blackburn and Sarah Jane Blackburn (née Tate). Soon after his birth the family moved to Carcroft, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, where his father took up an appointment as a schoolmaster. Harold became an engineer and by 1901 worked as a bicycle maker and repairer in Doncaster.
Pre-war aviation career.
Blackburn moved to London around 1909. In association with Albert Walker he built the Blackburn-Walker biplane, a tailless three-bay tandem pusher biplane with a canard elevator and the engine in front of its two occupants. It is not known how – or even if – this machine ever flew. Blackburn gained Royal Aero Club pilot’s certificate no. 79 at Brooklands on 9 May 1911, flying a Bristol Boxkite. In September 1912 aircraft constructor Robert Blackburn (no relation to Harold Blackburn) moved his flying school from Filey Bay in Yorkshire to Hendon. Harold Blackburn was appointed instructor and test pilot. The school’s activities were reported in Flight magazine but it ceased operations some time in early 1913. 
Harold Blackburn became a demonstration pilot for Robert Blackburn’s latest aircraft, the Blackburn Type D single-seat monoplane (which survives in flying condition with the Shuttleworth Collection) and its two-seat derivative, the Blackburn Type I. The Type I was demonstrated extensively throughout Yorkshire in the late summer of 1913 by Blackburn and its owner, Dr. M.G. Christie. They visited locales that had seen little or nothing of flying, such as Bridlington where Blackburn took 9-year-old American Isla Tudor up to a height of . Tudor became known as the “Little Air Lady”.
On 2 October 1913 Blackburn and Dr. Christie won the Wars of the Roses air race, a competition sponsored by the Yorkshire Evening News between the Yorkshire-built Type I monoplane and the Lancashire-built Avro 504 biplane, piloted by F. P. Raynham with Humphrey Verdon Roe as passenger. The race began evenly but in deteriorating conditions Raynham missed a checkpoint, handing the race to the Yorkshire crew.
For the Yorkshire Agricultural Show at Bradford on 22 July 1914 the Yorkshire Evening News established the Great Yorkshire Show Air Line, inaugurating “the first air-line service in Great Britain between cities flying to a time table” with half-hourly flights between Leeds and Bradford using the Blackburn Type I piloted by Harold Blackburn. The first passenger was Dorothy Una Ratcliffe, the Lady Mayoress of Leeds.
Wartime service.
Upon the outbreak of World War I Harold Blackburn joined the Royal Flying Corps, receiving his Certificate ‘B’ (no. 214) from the Central Flying School at Upavon, Wiltshire, on 19 August 1914. He flew in combat in France during that year. In 1915 he assumed command of ‘C’ Flight of No. 14 Squadron which was then under formation. The squadron commenced operations in the Sinai and Palestine campaign in November 1915, defending the Suez Canal from Turkish invasion. Blackburn received the Military Cross and also designed a bombsight which 2nd Lieutenant Cedric Waters Hill successfully used to destroy the water tank of the remote Turkish outpost at Bir el Hassana on 26 February 1916. Blackburn was given command of No. 22 (Reserve) Squadron in Egypt though he later saw further service in England and France, for which he received the Air Force Cross Blackburn achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was mentioned in despatches four times, including a special commendation for his work in the Palestinian campaign from General Sir Archibald Murray.
Post-war service.
Blackburn remained in the Royal Air Force after the war. He was second-in-command at RAF Henlow, until September 1924, when he left to become base commander at the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A. & A.E.E.) at Martlesham Heath in Suffolk, a position he held until November 1928.
Retirement and death.
Blackburn retired from the RAF in 1929 with the rank of Wing Commander and moved to Jersey. He was evacuated during World War II but returned to the island, where he died in 1959. He is buried at Trinity Church with his second wife Ruth Morley.
Honours.
Since 1967 the Jersey Aero Club has awarded the Harold Blackburn Cup for the longest distance flown by a club aircraft.

<doc id="36523269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36523269" title="Child labour in Nigeria">
Child labour in Nigeria

Child labour is the employment of children aged less than 18 in Nigeria in a manner that prevents them from basic education and their proper development. Child labour has a tradition in Nigeria. The number of child workers in Nigeria was estimated at 15 millions for 2006.
Poverty is major driver of child labour in Nigeria. Among many poor families, child labour is a large part of income of the family.
Current status.
UNICEF Nigeria is active for children's rights. Child workers include street vendors, shoe shiners, apprentice mechanics, carpenters, vulcanisers, tailors, barbers and domestic servants. Many working children are exposed to dangerous and unhealthy environments. In August, 2003, the Nigerian Government formally adopted three International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions setting a minimum age for the employment of children. The government also has implemented West African Cocoa Agriculture Project (WACAP). There is a similar inciidence of child labour in rural and urban Nigeria.
The US Department of Labour in its 2010 report claims Nigeria is witnessing the worst forms of child labor, particularly in agriculture and domestic service. In rural areas, most children work in agriculture of products such as cassava, cocoa and tobacco. These children typically work long hours and for little pay, with their families. The report claims some children are exposed to pesticides and chemical fertilizers in cocoa and tobacco fields because of archaic farming practices or because they are deployed as forced labour without protective gear. Additionally, street children work as porters and scavengers, and a growing number of them engage in begging. The report claims commercial sexual exploitation of children, especially girls, is also occurring in some Nigerian cities, including Port Harcourt and Lagos.
Trafficking.
There is trafficking of children in Nigeria. Child labour is more common among children of illiterates. On average, in the Southwestern zone of Nigeria, there is a higher work burden for working children. Boys tend to earn more. Girls' non-participation in schooling is more likely affected by parents' lack of interest than boys'. Non-participation in school is related to poverty. About one third of working children obtain no benefit from their employer. Child labour among pupils frequently impairs schooling.

<doc id="36523292" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36523292" title="LGBT adoption in the United States">
LGBT adoption in the United States

The legal status of LGBT adoption in the United States varies by jurisdiction. States and other jurisdictions may restrict adoption by sexual orientation or marital status. In some states, since adoptions are handled by local courts, practices may vary within a given jurisdiction. A same-sex couple can adopt in some states. More states permit adoption by an individual who is gay or lesbian.
According to Lambda Legal, which has represented many same-sex couples in state and federal courts:
Same-sex marriage can remove legal obstacles to the adoption of children by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. Adoption can take the form of a joint adoption by a same-sex couple (second parent adoption) or adoption by one member of a same-sex couple of the other's biological child (stepparent adoption). The second parent adoption process by a state-recognized spouse or partner is generally more streamlined and less expensive than stepparent adoption, though even the former is not as simple for same-sex couples as for different-sex couples unless their state recognizes same-sex marriages.
Population.
As of 2012, approximately two million children in the United States were being raised by LGBT parents and unable to establish a legal relationship with both their LGBT parents. According to the Williams Institute, as of 2009 "an estimated 20,000 same-sex couples are raising nearly 30,000 adopted children."
Professional assessments.
A consensus has developed among the medical, psychological, and social welfare communities that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents. The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology. Based on the robust nature of the evidence available in the field, the Third District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida was satisfied in 2010 that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise; the best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.
Public opinion.
A 2007 poll by CNN and Opinion Research Corp. found that 57% of respondents felt same-sex couples should have the right to adopt and 40% that they should not.
Politics.
On July 29, 1999, U.S. Representative Steve Largent introduced amendment 356 () to the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2000 () that would have banned joint adoption between individuals who are not related by blood or marriage in Washington, D.C. The amendment failed with 213 votes in favor and 215 opposed.
On May 10, 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told an interviewer: "And if two people of the same gender want to live together, want to have a loving relationship, or even to adopt a child -- in my state individuals of the same sex were able to adopt children. In my view, that's something that people have a right to do." Asked the next day to reconcile that with his opposition to same-sex marriage, he said: "Well actually I think all states but one allow gay adoption, so that's a position which has been decided by most of the state legislators, including the one in my state some time ago. So I simply acknowledge the fact that gay adoption is legal in all states but one."
States law on same-sex adoption.
Alabama. On October 12, 2012, a unanimous Alabama Court of Civil Appeals turned down the request of a woman to adopt her same-sex spouse's child. The women had been married in California. The court held that Alabama law did not recognize the women as spouses.
Arkansas. On November 4, 2008, Arkansas voters approved Act 1, a measure to ban anyone "co-habitating outside of a valid marriage" from being foster parents or adopting children. Although the law could apply to heterosexual couples, it was believed to have been written to target gay couples due to the fact that same-sex marriage is prohibited in that state, thereby making an adoption impossible. Single gay men and lesbians were still allowed to adopt in Arkansas. The law was overturned on April 16, 2010 by state judge Chris Piazza. The Arkansas Supreme Court in "Howard v. Arkansas" upheld the lower court's decision on April 7, 2011.
Florida. In Florida, a 1977 law prohibited adoption by homosexuals following the anti-gay Save Our Children campaign led by Anita Bryant. In November 2008, a state circuit court struck down the law in "", a case involving a gay male couple raising two foster children placed with them in 2004 by state child welfare workers. On appeal, on September 22, 2010, Florida's Third District Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the decision of the lower court. The state did not appeal.
Kansas. In November 2012, the Kansas Court of Appeals ruled in the case "In the Matter of the Adoption of I. M." that a single person who is not a biological parent of a child cannot petition to adopt that child without terminating the other parent's parental rights. Since Kansas does not recognize same-sex marriages, this ruling effectively prevents same-sex couples from second-parent adoption in Kansas. However, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled on February 22, 2013, in "Frazier v. Goudschaal" that a partner of a biological parent is entitled to parental rights.
Michigan. In December 2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that the state's adoption code permits second parent adoptions by same-sex couples.
Two Michigan lesbians, who are raising three children adopted by only one of them, filed a lawsuit in federal court in January 2012 seeking to have the state's ban on adoption by same-sex couples overturned. and in September amended that suit to challenge the state's ban on same-sex marriage as well.
Nebraska. Three same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the state on August 27, 2013, seeking the right to serve as foster and adoptive parents. It claimed that the state's policy against allowing two unrelated adults to adopt has been consistently enforced only against same-sex couples.
New York. An October 2012 court ruling in a custody dispute between two women in a same-sex relationship awarded custody to the adoptive parent rather than the biological mother.
Territories.
Puerto Rico. On February 20, 2013, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico upheld a law that bans same-sex couples from adopting children.
Recognition of adoption by other states.
In August 2007, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of "Finstuen v. Crutcher" ordered Oklahoma to issue a revised birth certificate showing both adoptive parents to a child born in Oklahoma who had been adopted by a same-sex couple married elsewhere. It held that an Oklahoma statute that rejects certain out-of-state adoption decrees violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution. By contrast, Louisiana in "Adar v. Smith" successfully defended in federal court its refusal to amend the birth certificate of a child born in Louisiana and adopted in New York by a same-sex married couple who sought to have a new certificate issued with their names as parents as is standard practice for Louisiana-born children adopted by opposite-sex married couples. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case on appeal.

The Power of the Whistler

The Power of the Whistler is a 1945 mystery film noir based on the radio drama "The Whistler". Directed by Lew Landers, the production features Richard Dix, Janis Carter and Jeff Donnell. It is the third of Columbia Pictures' eight "Whistler" films starring Richard Dix produced in the 1940s.
Plot.
In this story, William Everest (Richard Dix) is an amnesiac who learns about his past through the help of an amateur fortune teller (Janis Carter).
In the film's opening Carter sees Dix when she is in a restaurant with her sister and her sister's boyfriend. Without meeting him, she predicts his future using "cards". This presumably means Tarot cards, although the procedure for using such requires the participation of the person whose fortune is being told, as he or she is the one to shuffle the cards, cut the deck, and make selections from the cards dealt.
In any event, she predicts that he will be near death twice in the coming day. Outside of the restaurant she saves him from being struck by a car. It is then he realizes he is an amnesiac.
While it is not credible that Carter would "adopt" Dix as she does, even taking him home to spend the night with her and her sister (Jeff Donnell), what ensues is nevertheless an engrossing story.
The use of Dix as the leading man in the first seven films of the series was especially effective as he was an actor who was frequently cast as heroes and as villains. This provided genuine ambiguity and suspense as to what role, ultimately, he would play in the films. At times, as in this picture, he appears to be a sympathetic figure at first but turns sinister. In some films of the series he played complex characters who demonstrate both strong virtues and faults; a notable instance is the film Mysterious Intruder in which he plays a sleazy private detective who is undone at the end when he finally decides to do something honest and noble.
Reception.
Critical response.
Film critic Leonard Maltin said of the film, "Carter tries to help amnesiac Dix recall his identity, only to discover that he's an escaped psycho killer. Third Whistler entry is a little padded but still genuinely eerie."

Uruguayan constitutional referendum, 1917

A constitutional referendum was held in Uruguay on 25 November 1917. Amongst the changes to the system of government, the new constitution would create a National Council of Administration (known as the "colegiado") alongside the presidency. The National Council of Administration would have nine members; six from the first party and three from the second. The proposals were approved by 95.15% of voters. The result was confirmed by the Senate on 18 December, and the new constitution came into force on 1 March 1919.
Background.
The "colegiado" system had been first proposed by President José Batlle y Ordóñez in 1913, with the aim of creating an executive body similar to the Swiss Federal Council. Batlle had been opposed to the presidential system, believing that a collegiate body would lower the risk of a dictatorship emerging. Although the proposal was defeated in 1916, Batlle negotiated a compromise with the National Party to include the system in a new constitution.
New constitution.
As well as introducing the "colegiado" system, the new constitution determined that presidents could only serve a single term in office. It provided for a bicameral General Assembly with a term of four years, and introduced universal male suffrage. It also provided for the separation of church and state and allowed for constitutional amendments to be made with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the General Assembly.

Bongo-Bongo (linguistics)

Bongo-Bongo in linguistics is used as a name for an imaginary language. It is most commonly invoked in etymological studies to conceptualize random similarities between unrelated languages. It has also been used as a name for a constructed language invented by John Lyons as a teaching tool in linguistics.
Etymological studies.
Random similarities occur between related and unrelated languages and these are commonly disregarded in the academic study of etymology. The widespread habit of unscientific researches to look for such coincidental similarities and proclaim them as proof of genetic relationship has given rise to the term "Bongo-Bongo approach" or "Bongo-Bongo effect". For example, when comparing random surface forms in Basque and Hungarian (which are known to be unrelated languages), "pairings" such as "hegi" (Basque for "ridge") and "hegy" (Hungarian for "hill") are easily found but ultimately meaningless in terms of etymology without additional historical linguistic research and data.
Anthropology.
The concept can also be found occasionally in anthropology where the "Bongo-Bongo" are sarcastically used as an imaginary tribe or ethnicity (or by extension, Bongo Bongo Land).

The film did go on to gain some attention at the 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival earned a special mention for the "Audience Award for Best Animation Feature", but did not win.
Plot.
Three elementary school girls, Mako (Haruka Tomatsu/Caroline Combes), Miko (Sakiko Uran/Lucille Boudonnat), and Mutsuko (Minako Kotobuki/Lucille Boudonnat), decide to investigate the legends behind their school, St. Claire Elementary. As a lark they decide to vandalize the science room's human anatomy model Kunstrijk (Kouichi Yamadera/Bruno Meyere), who decides to take his own personal revenge on the three girls. He invites them to return to the school at midnight for a party, intending to scare them. Instead the three girls end up joining Kunstrijk and the skeleton model Goth (Hiromasa Taguchi/Christophe Seugnet) on a quest to gain a wish. The girls must find three medallions that are spread out over the school's enormous grounds. Kunstrijk directs them to go to three rooms: the Pool Room, the Digital Room, and the Music Room. Each room has their own guardian that fits each area's themes, as the Pool Room is guarded by a merman, the Digital Room's guardians are two all-knowing beings, and the Music Room's guardian is Mozart himself (Hiroshi Yanaka/Jean-Pierre Leblan). However the quest is made even more difficult as not everyone wants the girls to succeed and Kunstrijk is hiding his own secret reason for wanting the girls to succeed: the quest is actually to help ensure that he and Goth will remain in their living state forever rather than returning to inanimate objects.
Production.
The character of Kunstlijk was originally created for a dialogue-less short film intended for a music video channel and Takekiyo had planned to film a further series of shorts around the anatomical model. Producer friends of Takekiyo convinced him to work on a feature-length film instead, which necessitated the creation of a script and the addition of various characters. The film quality also improved from the level seen in the short and Takekiyo stated that he found that "Getting the characters to really perform like actors was both the hardest part and the most important."
Reception.
"Dread Central" gave the film 3 1/2 out of 5 blades, remarking that the "animation seems almost too two-dimensional at times, but it’s so colorful and dynamic that by the halfway point I was too wrapped up in the unfolding storyline to care" and that they aw the movie as a good introduction to the horror genre as a whole.

WWE Raw 1000

Raw 1000 was a television special that was broadcast live on July 23, 2012, airing on USA Network (in the U.S.) celebrating the 1000th episode of WWE's flagship show "Raw".
The episode also started the program's permanent three-hour format, which had been previously reserved only for special episodes. The event was held at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. The show featured actor Charlie Sheen (via Skype) serving as social media ambassador as well as various Hall of Famers and legends from the past.
Event.
The show kicked off with a video package showcasing the history of the show. WWE chairman and chief executive officer Vince McMahon opened the show, thanking the audience both live in the arena and watching at home for making the 1000th episode of "Raw" possible before introducing D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels). Before they did their signature crotch chop, they revealed the other members of DX (Sean Waltman, Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) aboard an army jeep. The reunited group was interrupted by Damien Sandow, who objected to the group's crass antics. DX then attacked him with a Sweet Chin Music from Michaels, followed by a Pedigree from Triple H, and the group stripping him down to his trunks. The group then performed some of their signature taunts.
Jim Ross would come out to call the opening match of the night which was a six-man tag team match, featuring World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara vs. Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler and Chris Jericho. Ziggler attacked his own partner Jericho, leading to a Brogue Kick from Sheamus for the win.
Afterwards, there was a backstage segment with AJ Lee, Layla, Jim Duggan, Roddy Piper, R-Truth and Mae Young and her son, The Hand.
The next match featured Brodus Clay quickly defeating Jack Swagger. After Clay won, Dude Love performed his signature Mr. Socko on Swagger and danced with Clay and The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi). Backstage, DX interrupted a yoga session between Trish Stratus and Triple H.
Next came the wedding of AJ Lee and Daniel Bryan. Jerry Lawler announced the special minister of the ceremony, Slick. Before the vows could be completed, AJ revealed she hadn't said "yes" to Bryan, but in fact said it to a business proposal by Mr. McMahon, who made her the new permanent "Raw" General Manager. Bryan stayed in the ring, venting his frustration out by destroying the wedding props and throwing them out of the ring. CM Punk came out to confront him and Bryan stated that he was the "greatest wrestler of all time" since Punk was "The Best in the World". The Rock made his return (his second appearance on Raw since the night after his match against John Cena at WrestleMania XXVIII). The Rock would insult Bryan and anger him further, and revealed that he would fight for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble against whomever the current WWE Champion will be at that time. He then hit Bryan with a Rock Bottom. Social media ambassador Charlie Sheen (appearing via Skype) would later make fun of Bryan for this incident, resulting in Bryan and Sheen exchanging insults and challenges for a fight throughout the remainder of the show.
Bret Hart came out next as the special guest ring announcer for the next match, a Intercontinental Championship match between champion Christian and The Miz. The Miz defeated Christian after hitting the Skull Crushing Finale. With the win, The Miz became recognized as a WWE Triple Crown winner.
Triple H then returned to call out Brock Lesnar (who attacked Triple H and broke his arm with the Kimura lock on the April 29, 2012 episode of "Raw Supershow"), but instead was confronted by Lesnar's attorney Paul Heyman. Heyman told Triple H that Lesnar would not fight him at SummerSlam. Triple H threatened Heyman, who retaliated by referencing Triple H's children. Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon came out and claimed that the lawsuits pursued by Heyman were a cover for his failures as a businessman in WCW, ECW and the WWE, called him a professional parasite, and slapped Heyman, which triggered him to accept the match on behalf of Lesnar. After Heyman again made a remark about her kids, Stephanie physically attacked him until Lesnar came out and attacked Triple H. Both men engaged in a brief fight before Triple H clotheslined Lesnar out of the ring.
Santino Marella and Hornswoggle made brief appearances to hand out collectibles to young fans before Howard Finkel made a special appearance to introduce Heath Slater (who had lost a number of matches with returning legends in the weeks leading up to "Raw 1000"), who challenged any WWE Legend backstage to a no-disqualification, no count-out match. Lita would answer the challenge, and hired The APA for protection. As Slater tried to escape, all the legends he had previously faced (Bob Backlund, Diamond Dallas Page, Doink the Clown, Rikishi, Road Warrior Animal, Roddy Piper, Sgt. Slaughter, Sycho Sid and Vader) chased him back into the ring, where he was hit with a Twist of Fate from Lita, setting up a Clothesline From Hell from John "bradshaw" Layfield and a Litasault from Lita for the pinfall.
Kane was then scheduled to face Jinder Mahal in a match, but Curt Hawkins, Tyler Reks, Hunico, Camacho and Drew McIntyre came out and tried to attack him to vent out their anger at being overlooked by WWE. The Undertaker would then return (making his first appearance since WrestleMania XXVIII) and, alongside Kane, fended off Mahal and his cohorts, punctuated with double Chokeslams and Tombstones.
The main event featured John Cena against CM Punk, with Cena cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase, which he had won two weeks earlier at the Money in The Bank pay-per-view, for a shot at Punk's WWE Championship. After what had been an even match up, Punk and the ref collided, knocking the referee unconscious to the ground. Big Show then came down to the ring and hit Cena with the Knockout Punch. Punk got the ref back into the ring and - after a moment's hesitation - pinned a seemingly knocked out Cena, but Cena managed to kick out. Cena then reversed Punk's attempted Go to Sleep into the STF. Big Show came back once again and attacked Cena, resulting in a disqualification victory for Cena (and since championships don't change hands on a Ddisqualification, this made Cena the second man to cash in a Money in the Bank contract and not win a title). Punk watched on as Show beat down Cena, before leaving ringside. The Rock then came down to the ring to help Cena, hitting a spinebuster and attempting to hit the People's Elbow, but was attacked by Punk who hit the Rock with a flying clothesline and a Go to Sleep before walking away, ending the show with the spotlight on him.
Reception.
The episode saw record viewer ship on TV and was the highest rated WWE show in 10 years. The show was watched by 6.3 million viewers, the first time it had crossed the 6 million mark since June 2009. It also became the most watched three-hour Raw in history and the most watched program on cable television. It also broke several social media records and was the most talked about entity on social network websites, setting new records for Twitter. Many fans were upset that Edge and Stone Cold Steve Austin did not appear on the show. Austin would comment on Twitter the next day saying that he couldn't fly out to Raw due to major knee surgery. The episode was later added as disc 3 on their 'RAW 100' DVD set which chronicles the top 100 moments in the history of the show.

Kath &amp; Kimderella

Kath & Kimderella is a 2012 Australian film. It is a spin-off of the hit television series, "Kath & Kim" created by Gina Riley and Jane Turner. The film was released on 23 May 2013 in Australia on Blu-ray and DVD via Roadshow Entertainment. The film made its premiere on Australian television just five days after, airing on the Seven Network on 28 May.
Plot.
Kath Day-Knight (Jane Turner) is still living in Fountain Lakes, Melbourne, however Kel (Glenn Robbins) has become a bore after their honeymoon period, and Kim (Gina Riley) has moved back in after a divorce with Brett (Peter Rowsthorn), despite receiving marriage counselling from Marion (Marg Downey). While visiting the local pharmacy for wart remover, Kath fills out a form for a chance to win a holiday to (the fictional) "Kingdom of Papilloma", on the heel of Italy (with the real scenes being filmed in Positano). Initially asking Kel, who refuses to travel because of his fear of flying and his dedication to watching the finals of "MasterChef", Kath reluctantly decides to take Kim and Sharon (Magda Szubanski) along on the trip. Coincidentally, Prue (Jane Turner) and Trude (Gina Riley) are clandestinely embarking on a holiday to Italy at the same time.
After a 50-plus hour flight, the three arrive in Italy exhausted. Becoming energised again following a stop at a cheap knock-off fashion shop, they arrive in Papilloma to find that their accommodation has closed down. Deciding to take their complimentary trip to the castle which sits atop the hill, they meet page Alain (Richard E. Grant), who Sharon takes a liking to, and King Javier (Rob Sitch), who takes a liking to Kath, and allows all three to stay in the castle, under the impression the three are rich from their imitation-brand clothing and can save him from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, a strange noise can be heard echoing throughout the castle, eyes watch from holes in pictures, and a masked figure, revealed to be the son of Javier, Prince Julio (Erin Mullally), becomes attracted to Kim (thinking that she is royalty from her top bearing the title "Princess").
Javier shows Kath through the town, where it becomes apparent that he is not liked by the poor townspeople, being spat at and having a tomato thrown at him. He later invites the three to a '80s-esque club, where they dance to "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" before Javier arrests a gay couple who were dancing, informing Kath that homosexuality is illegal in Papilloma. At a later date, the three are invited to a royal ball, to which Kim wears a large gypsy-inspired pink dress. The masked figure approaches and proposes to Kim, who initially refuses because she thinks his mask is hiding a disfigurement. Disregarding Javier's protests, Julio unmasks himself, revealing a handsome face, blond hair hidden by a wig and his crooked teeth to be fake. The invited townspeople gasp as it becomes apparent from his appearance he is not the queen's son. Kim then accepts (stating that she's "done worse"), and the imminent royal wedding makes worldwide news.
The same night, a fire is noticed on one of the castle's turrets. Rushing inside, the royals, along with Kath, Kim and Sharon, discover that the queen has appeared and set the castle on fire from Kim and Sharon's bedroom using Kim's hair straightener. However, the queen is suddenly killed by a falling chandelier and the fire is put out; Javier puts the girls' minds at ease when he explains that the queen was locked up because she was "crazy", jealous of his attraction to Kath and the source of the noises made around the castle.
Back in Australia, Kel is watching "MasterChef" with Brett when a news update from Papilloma about the royal wedding interrupts the show, and Brett realises it is Kim getting hitched. Javier is then shown grabbing Kath's backside, and Kel thinks she is having an affair. The pair decide to fly to Papilloma, but not before Kel receives hypnosis therapy from Marion to combat his fear of flying, which turns strangely sexual and programs him with the phrase "Tray tables up". While on the flight with Brett and Epponnee-Rae (Morghyne de Vries), now a spoiled brat who participates in child beauty pageants, Kel hears the phrase during the announcement that the flight will soon be touching down. In a trance, he makes his way to the toilet, where he undresses before later collecting his luggage, opens the sealed door (with the plane having just pulled into the airport), triggering the evacuation slide and leaves.
In Papilloma, Kath confronts Javier about being a despot, who rules Papilloma as an absolute monarch. Kel interrupts Javier attempting to put the moves on Kim, and the two engage in a sword duel for her affections; Kel wins and Javier flees. Kim and Sharon become lost before the wedding after exploring their shared bedroom's closet, with Kim having been sabotaged and attempted to be killed by maid Isabella (Jessica De Gouw), who loves Julio and earlier had been teased by Kim. After Kim and Sharon come across a disco-like chamber, it is revealed that Alain has kept all of the imprisoned townspeople and homosexuals there, and they are soon freed, as Kath and Kel, making their way to the wedding, discover the lost Kim and Sharon. Kim laments her messy hair, however Kath, in a fantasy moment, practices her amateur TAFE-learnt "wicca" on Kim, giving her a makeover (but not before turning her into Dame Edna).
With the four finally arriving at the wedding, Epponnee-Rae and Brett (who made their way to Papilloma with Prue and Trude, who are also in attendance) interrupt Kim and Julio's vows, and set off a heated argument in which it is revealed that Kim is not actually royalty, and that Julio (who had earlier revealed that his mother is Elle Macpherson) is not Javier's son, as he fathered no children. Gary Poole (Mick Molloy, who earlier appeared in a flashback), Kath's ex-husband and Kim's father, is revealed to be an extradited royal descendant, therefore making Kath a queen and Kim a princess. Alain also confesses he was "forced" to make love to the queen, and fathered a daughter, the maid Isabella, who professes her love for Prince Julio.
Following the unsuccessful wedding, the royals (including Kath and Kim) along with Kel and Brett appear on a balcony above the town square, where the townspeople chant for food. Javier decides to relinquish some of his power (allowing Papilloma to become a democracy), and a party with plentiful food is later thrown, which the townspeople attend. At the party, Sharon passionately kisses Alain, who tells her he can't return her affections because she's gay (which had been hinted at throughout the film, referencing Szubanski's real-life coming out), leaving her confused and disheartened before she meets Stephanie (Tasneem Roc), who shares her interest in golf and netball. Kath and Kim later discuss returning to Australia after their eventful, fairy tale-like holiday.
Production.
The film was originally titled "Kath & Kim – The Filum". The title was later changed with Riley stating that the new title reflects the elements of the storyline of Kath and Kim in a fractured fairytale. The holiday scenes were shot in Positano, Italy and filming took a total of two weeks.
Reception.
The film opened at number one at the Australian box office, taking in $2.1 million. It is the second highest opening for an Australian film in 2012, behind "The Sapphires". The film has received primarily negative reviews from critics, but received mainly positive reviews from audiences. The film currently has a 29% approval rating at review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes and a 6/10 rating on IMDb. Australian film review series, ABC Television's "At the Movies", rated the film two stars out of five; critic David Stratton, who reviewed the film, admitted he was not a fan of the TV show that inspired the film.
As of 16 October 2012 the film has grossed $6,150,771 at the Australian box office. Despite the film's success at the Australian box office, the film has not received a release in the United Kingdom.

Masunoyama Tomoharu

Early life and sumo background.
Born in the Philippines to a Japanese father and a Philippina mother, his family moved to Japan with when he was about one month old. His parents had always been fans of sumo and from a very young age he had aspired to be a sumo wrestler. He was a member of the sumo club at his primary school, and when his junior high school did not have a sumo club he decided to attend practice at an area high school and other locations so he could continue doing sumo. He participated and did very well in children's sumo and also in national amateur sumo tournaments. However, in his third year of junior high school his parents divorced and he moved back with his mother to her native Philippines. He graduated from junior high school there and in May 2006 returned to Japan. Still interested in sumo, he decided to join Chiganoura stable.
Career.
He first stepped on the pro sumo "dohyō" in July 2006. Being a diligent trainer, and managing to avoid injury, he rose through the ranks of and in a little over a year and half achieved his first championship at the rank of "sandanme" 46 with a 7-0 perfect record. It would take him another two and half years of mostly winning tournaments to reach the second division "jūryō" in November 2010. He entered "jūryō" at the same time as Takayasu. Both had the distinction of being half Filipino as well as simultaneously being the first two wrestlers to enter "jūryō" that were born in the Heisei Era. Masunoyama only managed a 6-9 but as he had debuted at the relatively high rank of "jūryō" 11, he was spared relegation. In the January 2011 tournament, he won his first five bouts in a row, but on the sixth day in morning practice he injured a ligament in his right leg. He made the decision to continue competing, and managed to beat Kakizoe on that day. However, two days later he aggravated the injury in a bout against Daidō and was obliged to miss the next day and take a fusenpai. He then returned for two more days, both wins against veteran wrestlers Tamanoshima and Chiyohakuhō before losing again and re-aggravating his injury to miss the final two days. Through all this he still managed an 8-5 record with two absences. Three tournaments later (with one being missed due to the sumo match-fixing scandal), at the rank of "jūryō" 1 he came just short of a championship, but lost in a playoff to Myōgiryū who was in his "jūryō" debut. This record allowed Masunoyama to be promoted to the top-tier "makuuchi" for the following September tournament. However, on the fourth day in a bout against Tochinowaka he would injury the same ligament in his left leg that he had previously injured in his right leg. He was forced to bow out of the tournament with only a 2-3 record, and was demoted back to "jūryō". Though advised by his doctor not to enter the next tournament in order to let his injury heal, he insisted on fighting on. However, unable to do much training and hobbled by his injury he had losing records in the following two tournaments. He returned to form in the next tournament in March 2012 and posted strong winning records in this and the following tournament. He re-entered "makuuchi" in July 2012, marking it with an 11-4 win and the Fighting Spirit prize. Since then, however, he has had two losing tournaments to only one winning one for the remainder of the year. In 2013, he had a lackluster performance, recording mostly losing tournaments, but mostly records of 7-8 which kept him from falling too far down the ranks. This continued in 2014, and his unimpressive 4-11 score at "maegashira" 13 will likely lead to his relegation for July.
Personal information.
Masunoyama is known for his very labored breathing after almost every bout. He also has a portable oxygen tank he uses during practice when he is feeling out of breath. His problems have been explained by Masunoyama having a low lung capacity ("small lungs"). Previously there have been speculations about a heart condition that might cause similar symptoms (e.g. ASD/VSD). However, cardiologic checks carried out in 2013 were negative.
In July 2006, Masunoyama was the sole new recruit into professional sumo, and this garnered him a lot of attention with the press. The press has continued to be enamored with him because of his friendly character, diligence, and ability to cope with adversity. He has also appeared on various television programs to be interviewed and has proven himself to have a remarkable singing voice on these programs.
He has said in interviews that he feels indebted to his mother for raising him on her own, and he sends money to her in the Philippines. He expressed hope to one day buy her a house.
Fighting style.
Because of his lungs condition Masunoyama has to win his bouts as quickly as possible and he goes on the offensive right from the "tachi–ai" or initial charge, using pushing and thrusting techniques ("tsuki/oshi"). Nearly half of all his victories are by either "yorikiri", the force out, or "oshi dashi", the push out.

Sithu of Pinya (, ; also known as Myinsaing Sithu) was king of Pinya from 1340 to 1344. The king is not mentioned in any of the royal chronicles. He only appears in a Pinya era inscription as King Myinsaing Sithu. Sithu, who according to the inscription succeeded Uzana I, may have been a caretaker for his nephew and son-in-law Kyawswa I of Pinya. Sithu's elder daughter Saw Gyi was married to Kyawswa I.
The king was likely Kyawswa I's maternal uncle since Kyawswa I's father Thihathu had only two brothers, Athinhkaya and Yazathingyan, both of whom had already died.

Ridi Viharaya

Ridi Viharaya () or Silver Temple is a 2nd-century BCE Theravada Buddhist temple in the village of Ridigama, Sri Lanka. Built during the reign of Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura, the temple is considered as the place where the silver ore, which provided silver to complete Ruwanwelisaya; one of the largest stupa in Sri Lanka, was discovered. According to the chronicles "Mahavamsa" and "Thupavamsa", the Ridi Viharaya complex was built in gratitude for helping him cherish his dream of completing Ruwanwelisaya.
Location.
Approximately 18 kilometres northeast of Kurunegala, Ridi Viharaya is located in the city of Ridigama. Kurunegala is located 94 kilometres northeast of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. The temple is approximately 10 kilometres from Ibbagamuwa, in the A6 highway, which connects Kurunegala and Dambulla.
History.
Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura, a Sinhalese king of ancient Sri Lanka, known for his campaign that defeated and overthrowed the usurping Tamil prince Elara of Chola Kingdom, reigned from 161 BCE to 137 BCE in the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Upon his victory over Elara, he initiated construction of Ruwanwelisaya, also known as the "Great Stupa", one of the tallest monuments built before the 20th century. Among other materials, silver was required for the basement of the stupa.
In the meantime, some merchants were travelling from the central highlands of Sri Lanka, to the then capital of the country; Anuradhapura. According to the chronicles, they saw some ripe jackfruit in the Ridigama area; cut it and thought of offering the first half to Buddhist monks as a ritual. Four Arhat monks appeared according to their wish and accepted the Dāna. Then four more monks came and accepted the Dāna. The last monk, known as Arhat Indragupta, after partaking the jackfruit, directed the merchants to a path which led to a cave with a silver ore. They informed the monach of their finding after arriving in Anuradhapura. He was much elated upon hearing the news. The ore provided the required amount of silver for the construction work. In gratitude, he built a temple complex on the silver ore, employing 300 masons and 700 others including his chief artisan "Vishwakarma Prathiraja".
There are approximately twenty-five caves around the temple, which are considered to be inhabited by Arhat monks, since the arrival of Arhat Mahinda in 3rd century BCE. The temple was revived in the 18th century CE, during the reign of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy (1746-1778 CE). Uda Viharaya was added to the complex during this period. Several affiliated devalas: "Kumara Bandara Devalaya" and "Paththini Devalaya" were also established. Ridi Viharaya now falls under the Malwatte chapter of Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka.
Associated buildings, structures and locations.
Serasum Gala.
A rock to the right of the entrance, which is believed to be the place where the initial temple was built. It is also considered that this was the place where king Dutthagamani dressed prior to worshipping the temple. A small stupa is located on top of this rock.
Waraka Welandu Viharaya.
Waraka Welandu Viharaya is a Polonnaruwa era building, considered as the place where the Arhat monks accepted jackfruit from the merchants. The name "Waraka Welandu Viharaya" (temple which the jackfruit was consumed) implies this notion. This small Gedige-type building of the size of a room, is built in stone and contains a number of Kandyan era paintings. Its stone roof rests on eight stone pillars, which are decorated on all four sides. Hindu influence can be observed in the carvings of female dancers, which are usually not found in Buddhist temples.
Hevisi Mandapaya.
Located in front of the Maha Viharaya, the Hevisi Mandapaya (or the drummers' pavilion) contains a rice bowl and other objects of historical value. A centuries-old "Pallakkiya", which was used to carry elderly monks, can also be seen hung on its roof.
Maha Viharaya.
Maha Viharaya, or the main temple, is located inside the "Rajatha lena" (or the silver cave); a massive rock which takes the shape of a cobra head. This cave is considered as the place where the original silver ore was found. Various monarchs, including Amandagamani Abhaya (21-31 CE) and Parakramabahu I of Polonnaruwa (1153-1186 CE) have sponsored the reconstruction and expansion of this temple, which is the oldest of all buildings in the complex. 
It contains a number of Buddharupa in various gestures. This include a 9 metre recumbent Buddha statue and an Anuradhapura era-gold plated Buddha statue. According to "Ridi vihara asna", a chronicle, the latter was brought down from India. Other statues: including an ancient statue which is believed to be of king Dutthagamani, eight standing Buddha statues, an Avalokiteśvara statue and a reclining Buddha statue donated by Burma can also be seen inside this building. The floor in which recumbent Buddha statue is placed, is decorated with Dutch era porcelain floor tiles: popularly known as "Bible tiles". These blue-and-white tiles portray various biblical figures and stories such as expulsion from the Garden of Eden, dove of peace, prophets of yore, the last supper, burning bush and the creation of man. These tiles were gifted to king Kirti Sri Rajasinha by a Dutch envoy. All rooves and walls of Maha Viharaya are decorated with paintings.
Uda Viharaya.
Uda Viharaya, or the upper temple belongs to the Kandyan era, and contains a seated Buddha statue with "Makara Thorana" and a "Sandakada pahana" (moonstone). This Sandakada pahana is a unique design, as it takes a semi-circular shape instead of a triangular shape, which is more common in similar designs of Kandy era. There are also sculptures of Hindu deities around the main statue. The chamber contains paintings of mythological animals and Ravana: a main character of the legend, the Ramayana. A stupa is located by the right side of this temple. At the entrance, is a Hindu devalaya, which is dedicated to the protector god of the area.
Paintings and sculpture.
The cave walls of the "Rajatha lena" are painted with images that relate to incidents of Gautama Buddha's life. Some of these frescos were never completed, but early sketches can still be seen. The cave walls contain small carved out drains known as ""Kataram"", to drain rain water away from the paintings.
The Maha Viharaya houses a special kind of sculpture: "Pancha Nari Ghataya". It appears as a vase at a distance, but five entwined maiden figures are revealed when observed closely.

Community Professional Loudspeakers

Community Professional Loudspeakers is an American manufacturer of loudspeakers and sound reinforcement equipment. The company has been located in the Philadelphia area since its inception in 1968, and has occupied its present location in Chester, Pennsylvania since 1981.
Background.
Bruce Howze founded the company in 1968, which was first named Community Light and Sound. The company originally started in the Philadelphia area, and now occupies a 100,000 square foot space in Chester, Pennsylvania.
Community established itself as the first company to utilize fiberglass to create large yet lightweight loudspeaker horns and enclosures. In 1970, it introduced its first notable live sound reinforcement loudspeaker product, the LMF, a fiberglass midrange horn. The company next developed the Leviathan fiberglass composite bass horn, which Elvis Presley used in his 1971 tour. Several top musical groups from that era used Leviathans as well, such as the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Earth, Wind & Fire.
In the mid-1970s, Community became one of the first companies to meticulously test and document the performance of both its own loudspeakers and competitors’ loudspeakers. Community based its test measurement philosophy on the underlying principles of “free field” and “far field,” believing that far more dependable and relevant data can be obtained by testing loudspeakers at measurement distances that correspond to actual listening distances.
Since its founding, Community has pursued pioneering loudspeaker technologies. In 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the company a patent for Carbon Ring Cone Technology.
Bruce W. Howze still runs the company today, together with Christine Howze and John Wiggins. The Community brand has a global presence with its products being for live performance and permanent installation in houses of worship, schools, and other venues.
Community Professional is also well known for its weather-resistant loudspeaker designs, which are installed in major sports stadia and arenas throughout the world. This same quality makes the company’s loudspeakers a valuable component in emergency notification systems, such as the one used by the Tidal Information System in Venice, Italy.

Massimiliano Gioni (born 1973 in Busto Arsizio, Italy) is a curator and contemporary art critic based in New York City, and Associate Director and Director of Exhibitions at the New Museum. He is the Artistic Director of the Nicola Trussardi Foundation in Milan. Gioni was the curator of the 55th Venice Biennale.
Gioni has been involved in a wide range of projects: co-curator of the Venice Biennale (2003) (curating the La Zona section); co-curator of Of Mice and Men, the Berlin Biennial (2006); co-curator of Manifesta 5 (2005), curator of 10,000 Lives, the 8th Gwangju Biennale (2010). In 2002, at 29, he opened a one-meter-square space, The Wrong Gallery, in Chelsea with Ali Subotnick (then of Parkett) and Maurizio Cattelan; when they lost the lease, they reopened in the Tate Modern. Gioni was US editor of Flash Art magazine from 2000 to 2002. Since 2003 Gioni has been directing the Nicola Trussardi Foundation, a nomadic museum which organizes exhibitions by contemporary artists in forgotten buildings, public monuments and abandoned palazzos in the city of Milan.
Exhibitions.
Gioni has worked on numerous exhibitions including: Uniform. Order and Disorder (PS1, New York, 2001); The Fourth Sex. Adolescent Extremes (Pitti Discovery, Florence, 2002); and Yesterday Begins Tomorrow (Deste Foundation, Athens, 2003). In 2003 Gioni was hired as the Artistic Director of Fondazione Nicola Trussardi in Milan and he curated "The Zone" for the 50th edition of the Venice Biennial. He was part of the curatorial team for the presentation of acquisitions of the Dakis Joannou Collection (Athens, 2004).
While associate Director at the New Museum, Gioni curated the signature group exhibitions "Younger Than Jesus" and "Ostalgia". Famed art critic Jerry Saltz wrote this about Ostalgia in his review of the top ten art events in 2011: “curator Massimiliano Gioni is now master of his own form of large-scale exhibition as narrative, time machine, pleasurable pedagogy, historical potboiler come to life, and insight."
As the curator of the 8th Gwangju Biennale (2010), in Gwangju, South Korea, Gioni created a sprawling investigation of the relationships that bind people to images and images to people. Titled "10,000 Lives" and featuring works by more than 100 artists, realized between 1901 and 2010, as well as several new commissions, the exhibition was configured as a temporary museum in which both artworks and cultural artifacts are brought together to compose an idiosyncratic catalogue of figures and icons, faces and masks, idols and dolls. Gioni drew the exhibition title from Maninbo (10,000 Lives), a thirty-volume epic poem conceived by Korean author Ko Un while imprisoned in 1980 for his participation in the South Korean democratic movement. The 3,800 poems that compose Ko Un's magnum opus Maninbo (10,000 Lives) reads as a personal encyclopedia of humanity. Unfolding as a family album, the 8th Gwangju Biennale looked at images as sites of affection and means of survival. The exhibition also examined how images are fabricated, circulated, stolen and exchanged - interrogating their power, while trying to capture their many lives. Over 500,000 visitors attended.

Blandford Church

The Brick Church on Well's Hill, now known as Old Blandford Church of Bristol Parish, is located in Petersburg, Virginia adjacent to Blandford Cemetery. It was erected in 1735. The church building was abandoned in 1806 after the building of another Episcopal church in Petersburg, when the Town of Blandford had been absorbed by Petersburg. Necessary repairs for its preservation were made by the City of Petersburg in 1882. As part of the restoration project, the Ladies' Memorial Association solicited funds from each former Confederate state for the creation and installation of a stained glass window in memory of the Confederate soldiers from that state. Louis Comfort Tiffany's studio was commissioned to design the fifteen memorial compass windows. Each of the large windows contains the image of a Saint and symbols associated with the Saint. The four smaller windows were designed to complement the larger ones.
History.
At their meeting on November 18, 1900, the Ladies' Memorial Association decided to ask permission to make "Old Blandford Church" into a "mortuary and memorial chapel. " Fifteen windows were installed between 1904 and 1912. Most display a state seal, the figure of a saint, and an inscription. Eleven were donated by each of the former Confederate states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Two were donated by Missouri and Maryland. Kentucky, another border state, was the only state that refused to participate. In addition, there is a window of a Christian cross of jewels donated by Louis Comfort Tiffany.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

Sira poison dart frog

Ranitomeya sirensis is a species of poison dart frog endemic to Peru. "R. sirensis" is widely known as the Sira poison dart frog, or more popularly as "R. lamasi". "R. sirensis" is kept as a pet by herpetoculturists and is considered to be one of the more difficult poison dart frogs to keep due to its relative rarity and the delicate nature of its tadpoles.
Poison.
Like most "Ranitomeya" species, "R. sirensis" is a mildly toxic poison dart frog. Its skin secretes small amounts of pumiliotoxins which coat the frog and cause pain and mild muscle spasms if the frog is handled carelessly. The symptoms may be more severe if the frog is ingested, but unlike the "Phyllobates" and "Oophaga" species, "R. sirensis" secretes the comparatively mild pumiliotoxin C in very small quantities due to its tiny size. As a result, "sirensis" mostly rely on their agility, speed, and ability to take shelter in the leaf litter or in dense foliage for protection.
"R. sirensis", as with all dendrobatid frogs, loses its poison in captivity. The reason for the loss of its toxicity is thought to be the removal of a toxic insect or other invertebrate from the diet. Scientists have determined that members of the genus "Phyllobates" derive their dangerously potent toxins from local melyrid beetles. As "R. sirensis" is much less toxic than the "Phyllobates" species, the source of its toxin is not thought to be melyrid beetles; instead, it is likely an invertebrate that remains undiscovered.

Psy

Park Jae-sang (born December 31, 1977), hangul: 박재상, hanja: 朴載相, better known by his stage name Psy (, ; ), stylized PSY, is a South Korean singer, songwriter, rapper, dancer, record producer and television personality. Psy is known domestically for his humorous videos and stage performances, and internationally for his hit single "Gangnam Style". The song's refrain ""Oppan" Gangnam Style" (translated as "Big brother (to a female) is Gangnam style", with Psy referring to himself) was entered into "The Yale Book of Quotations" as one of the most famous quotations of 2012.
On October 23, 2012, Psy met UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the United Nations Headquarters where Ban expressed his desire to work with the singer because of his "unlimited global reach". On December 21, 2012, his music video for "Gangnam Style" exceeded one billion views on YouTube, becoming the first video to do so in the website's history. Psy was subsequently recognized by the media as the "King of YouTube". On May 31, 2014, the video for PSY's Gangnam Style hit two billion views.
In December 2012, MTV noted Psy's rise from little-known outside of South Korea to "global superstar", and, for being first in the YouTube-era to secure a place in pop-culture history, hailed the singer as the "Viral Star of 2012". On December 31, 2012, Psy performed in a globally televised New Year's Eve celebration with American rapper MC Hammer on-stage in front of a live audience of over a million people in Times Square, New York City.
Biography.
1977–95: Early life.
Park Jae-sang was born on December 31, 1977, to an affluent family in the Gangnam District of Seoul, South Korea. His father, Park Won-Ho, is the executive chairman of DI Corporation, a manufacturer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment listed on the Korea Exchange. His mother, Kim Young-hee, owns several restaurants in Gangnam.
Park attended Banpo (반포) Elementary and Middle Schools and Sehwa (세화) High School. He disliked school and bothered some of his classmates, although he also sometimes made them laugh. In an interview on South Korea's Seoul Broadcasting System, a former teacher of Park said "I remember Psy making a lot of sexual jokes during class. He had such a big influence that he would drive the entire class to his jokes. I disliked him at the time, but looking back, I see that he added a great energy to the class."
Park told CNN's Alina Cho that when he was 15 years old, he watched a Korean TV programme that introduced foreign pop music. One particular episode showed a concert at Wembley Stadium held by the British rock band Queen where they performed their 1975 hit single "Bohemian Rhapsody". Park said it was this concert footage that sparked his love for music.
1996–2000: Brief study in the United States and career beginnings.
As part of preparations to take over DI Corporation from his father, Park had originally planned to study business administration at Boston University in 1996. However, upon his arrival in the United States, he lost interest in his studies, spending his remaining tuition funds on musical instruments and entertainment equipment, including a computer, an electric keyboard, and a MIDI interface. After attending an English-language summer course and studying for one semester, Park dropped out of Boston University and applied to study at Berklee College of Music instead. During his time at Berklee, Park took core curriculum lessons in ear training, contemporary writing and music synthesis, but he soon dropped out and returned to South Korea to pursue a career as a singer, without having attained a degree from either Boston University or Berklee.
In South Korea, Psy made his first appearance on Korean national television in 2000 after his dancing caught the eye of a TV producer.
2001–02: "Psy from the Psycho World!", controversy, and domestic success.
In January 2001, Psy debuted his full-length album "Psy from the Psycho World!", for which he was fined by South Korean government authorities due to his album's "inappropriate content". Psy was a rookie hip hop singer that stirred up the Korean pop music scene with very blunt lyrics, peculiar dance moves and an unconventional appearance that earned him the nickname "The Bizarre Singer".
His second album "Sa 2" also created controversy upon its release in 2002, earning complaints from civil groups due to the potentially negative influence his album would have on children and teenagers. Since then, Psy has been thought of as a controversial artist, and "Sa 2" was banned in 2002 from being sold to the under-19 set. In September of the same year, Psy released his third album "3 Psy". The album's title song, "Champion", saw great success partly due to the hype from the World Cup games held in Seoul. Despite the significant amount of controversy surrounding his music, Psy was awarded songwriting accolades at the annual Seoul Music Awards, marking his breakthrough in the South Korean music industry.
2003–09: Military service, " Sa Jib", and re-enlistment.
In 2003, Psy was enlisted in the South Korean military as part of mandatory military service imposed on all South Korean men aged 18 to 35. Psy was excused from military duty due to working at a software developing company (the South Korean government grants exemptions to those with technical expertise work in companies that serve the national interest). He was expected to be released from duties in 2005. In 2006, Psy released his fourth album "Sa Jib", which won honors at the 2006 SBS Music Awards and Hong Kong's Mnet Asian Music Awards.
In 2007, state prosecutors accused Psy of "neglecting" his work, holding concerts and appearing on local television networks during his period of prior employment. On October 12, 2007, the Seoul Administrative Court decided that Psy must be redrafted, rejecting a lawsuit filed by Psy against the Military Manpower Administration (MMA) in August. Two months later, Psy was re-drafted into the military where he had held the rank of Private First Class and served as a signalman in the 52nd Army Infantry Division, before being released from duties in July 2009.
2010–12: 5th studio album and debut performance in Japan.
Owing to financial difficulties, Psy could no longer release his own songs. His wife encouraged him to join the South Korean music label YG Entertainment, whose founder and chief executive officer Yang Hyun-suk was an old friend of Psy's. In 2010, Psy joined YG Entertainment. The K-pop singer Kim Heechul, from the boyband Super Junior, expressed that he'd wished Psy would have joined his group's label SM Entertainment instead. Psy released his fifth album "PsyFive" in 2010, and its lead single "Right Now" was banned from under-19 audiences by South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family for what it deemed an "obscene" lyric, "Life is like toxic alcohol". Despite the ban, Psy received awards during the 2011 Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Psy had, up until this point, topped domestic music charts half a dozen times throughout his twelve-year career in South Korea.
On January 7, 2012, Psy performed alongside K-pop bands Bigbang and 2NE1 in front of 80,000 Japanese fans during the "YG Family Concert" in Osaka. His performance was broadcast by Mezamashi TV ("mezamashi" meaning "wake-up alarm"), a Japanese news magazine show produced by Fuji Television. This marked his first appearance on a foreign broadcasting network. During the concert, Psy introduced himself to his Japanese fans with a sign that read "I’m a famous singer well-known for driving the audience wild in Korea, but here, today, I’m just a little chubby newcomer" and sang five of his hit songs while Japanese TV commentators expressed their approval in their astonishment at his humorous incorporation of the moves of Lady Gaga and Beyoncé.
2012–13: "Gangnam Style" and unexpected international breakthrough.
In July 2012, Psy released his sixth album "Psy 6 (Six Rules), Part 1" and the song "Gangnam Style" appeared in broadcasting networks and newspapers outside Asia. On August 14, "Gangnam Style" ranked first on YouTube's 'Most Viewed Videos' monthly chart; on August 21, 2012, "Gangnam Style" officially charted No. 1 on the iTunes Music Video Charts, overtaking Justin Bieber's "As Long as You Love Me" and Katy Perry's "Wide Awake"; this feat was the first for a South Korean artist. After the video went viral, celebrities quickly jumped on board, with Katy Perry, Britney Spears, and Tom Cruise taking to Twitter to share their delight. The Gangnam Style phenomenon has also popularized his older music videos, such as "Right Now." On September 14, 2012, he appeared on "The Today Show" on NBC in New York City, performing the song live and teaching dance moves to the anchors. The following day, he also made a cameo appearance on "Saturday Night Live" during a skit featuring "Gangnam Style."
Riding high on the success of Gangnam Style, Psy was signed by Scooter Braun to Braun's Schoolboy Records, a label distributed by Republic Records. In early September, the Gangnam district awarded Psy with a plaque and named him an honorary ambassador. On October 24, 2012, Psy was recognized by the United Nations as an "International sensation." According to Reuters, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon scheduled a meeting with Psy in the belief that music has great power to overcome intolerance. On October 23, 2012, they met at the United Nations Headquarters where Ban expressed his desire to work with Psy. He remarked that Psy has an "unlimited global reach" and said, "I hope that we can work together using your global reach."
According to Korean newspaper "The Dong-a Ilbo", Psy was appointed as a goodwill ambassador of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
On November 7, 2012, Psy held a speech in England at the Oxford Union to discuss the inspiration behind Gangnam Style and his next album. He told the audience that due to the success of Gangnam Style he is now living in both a dream and a nightmare, as it will be difficult for his next song to equal Gangnam Style's success. He also talked about his early life and the moment he realized Gangnam Style became famous. According to "The Independent", tickets for his speech were "in such demand they had to be assigned by ballot – a method not required when former presidential candidate John McCain spoke earlier that year, nor when Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama nor Michael Jackson spoke."
On November 12, 2012, Psy became the second South Korean music artist to appear at the MTV Europe Music Awards where he performed Gangnam Style and held off competition from Rihanna, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga to win the "Best Video" award. The event was broadcast worldwide and hosted by the German model and actress Heidi Klum, who introduced Psy to the audience as the "undisputed King of Pop". A few days later, American singer-songwriter Madonna performed a mashup of "Gangnam Style" and "Give It 2 Me" alongside Psy and her backup dancers during a concert in New York City at Madison Square Garden during her MDNA Tour. Psy later told reporters that his gig with Madonna had "topped his list of accomplishments."
On November 24, 2012, "Gangnam Style" became the most viewed video in YouTube history, surpassing the previous most watched video, Justin Bieber's "Baby". The number of views were achieved about eleven times faster than Bieber's. Psy later won four awards at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards in Hong Kong. He met actor and stunt performer Jackie Chan, who called him a role model that proved that "dreams do come true". On December 21, "Gangnam Style" reached 1 billion views on YouTube, becoming the first video to do so.
In 2013, Psy made his debut on South American television by giving an interview on the Brazilian news program "Fantástico". It was announced on January 27, 2013, that Psy would perform at South Korea's presidential inauguration ceremony on February 25, 2013.
2013: "Gentleman".
On April 12, 2013, the audio of Psy's follow-up single "Gentleman" was leaked onto the internet, a day before its official international release. On the following day, the music video for 'Gentleman' premiered at Psy's 'Happening' Concert, which was attended by 50,000 people and live streamed on YouTube to an audience of 150,000. Guest performers of the concert included Lee Hi, 2NE1 and G-Dragon. He had reportedly invested US$2.7 million into the production of the concert.

Artistry.
Park Jae-sang's stage name 'Psy' derives from the word 'psycho'. Explaining his stage name, he said in a BBC interview, "what I thought was, you know, crazy about music, dancing, performance, so that kind of psycho."
Influences.
According to "Time", Freddie Mercury of the British rock band Queen inspired Psy to start his music career. Psy also revealed that the one celebrity he wants to meet most is the American actor Tom Cruise, who helped popularize "Gangnam style" on Twitter and tweeted whether Psy would "make a good future co-star Gangnam Style?"
Public image.
Psy is known for his sense of humor in his concerts, where he imitates female singers such as Park Ji-yoon, Lee Hyori, Lady Gaga and Beyonce.
Although his music is part of the K-pop (Korean popular music) genre, Beth Hong from "The Vancouver Observer" noted that Psy doesn't fit the standard K-pop idol image of being incredibly young, good-looking, and able to carry a melodramatic note."
Lucy Williamson from the BBC recognized Psy as South Korea's "newest and biggest music star", but also described him as "unpolished, unpredictable and he doesn't look like your typical Korean idol". Sarah Charlton from Reuters called him a "chubby South Korean pop singer" that has found fame and popularity in a "sea of pretty K-pop stars". In South Korea, some have called him the "Bizarre Singer" while others consider him to be "the antithesis of what is popular in Korean pop music".
Chelsea Handler from "Chelsea Lately" jokingly described Psy as "Korea's Ricky Martin, as well as a sex symbol" during his introduction on the show, while Gil Kaufman from MTV described the singer as one of the "biggest pop sensations in the world."
Legacy.
During the span of his career, Psy was awarded multiple Guinness World Records for:
As a result of his achievements, Psy is considered to be the first K-pop artist to make a breakthrough in the Western music industry. In an interview with Agence France-Presse, Psy affirmed that "It will be only a matter of time before K-Pop will produce many others like Psy."
According to Hugo Swire, the British Minister of State for the Foreign Office, Psy's music has given the world a glimpse of the dynamism and vibrancy of modern Korea. South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism recognized Psy's cultural achievements by bestowing upon him the Okgwan Order, a 4th grade Order of Cultural Merit.
Personal life.
On October 14, 2006, Psy married Yoo Hye-yeon, a cello major at Yonsei University and his girlfriend of three and a half years. According to the Korean Broadcasting System, the couple were introduced by a mutual acquaintance. They have twin daughters.
In a July 2013 interview with "The Sunday Times", Psy stated that he has a drinking problem, noting that the only time he isn't drinking alcohol is when he is hung over.
Psy considers "Gangnam Style" to be the greatest achievement of his life.
Psy finalized the purchase of a condominium unit in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, US in November 2012. One media report anticipated that Psy made the purchase to relocate to Los Angeles following his signing with US-based music manager Scooter Braun.
Legal issues.
In late 2001, Psy was arrested for smoking and possessing marijuana and was sentenced 25 days in jail and as a result, was unable to be at his grandfather's deathbed as he lost his battle with cancer, or attend his funeral. During an interview, Psy revealed "I was very close to him. I was not there at the funeral: I will regret this for the rest of my life, because my grandpa loved me so much, and I couldn't be there for him on his deathbed." Psy was also fined in January 2002 for the marijuana incident.
Views on North Korea.
In the early 2010s, South Korea's Sunshine Policy towards North Korea was abolished as tensions between the two countries continued to increase. As a result, Psy was questioned by the media on several occasions regarding his views on North Korea.
On April 13, 2013, Psy attended a press conference where he expressed regret about his country's conflict with North Korea and described the situation as a "tragedy". He also expressed hope that North Koreans would one day be able to enjoy his music before elaborating that his job is to make everyone, including North Koreans, laugh. Right before the start of a concert in Seoul, Psy added:
In an interview with "The Daily Beast" (an American news website), Psy was asked to give his take on Kim Jong-un's recent threats against South Korea and the United States, to which he replied: "Well, as an entertainer, I don’t want to talk about politics. As a Korean citizen, I want peace. That’s all I can say. I want permanent peace."
Controversy.
Anti-American performances and subsequent apology.
In 2002, Psy participated in an anti-American concert after a U.S. military convoy accidentally struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls in the Yangju highway incident. The soldiers involved in the incident were acquitted by U.S. military courts, which fueled a significant amount of anti-American sentiment in South Korea. Inspired by that incident, Psy lifted up a miniature model of an 'American tank' and smashed it against the stage.
In 2004, the South Korean translator and Christian missionary Kim Sun-il was kidnapped and beheaded in Iraq after the South Korean government refused to reconsider sending its armed forces to support the Iraq War. Although initial protests were only directed towards the South Korean government and towards extremists in Iraq, anti-U.S. military protesters decided to seize the moment to trigger a much larger wave of anti-Americanism. During a concert, Psy admonished the Iraqi kidnappers, condemned South Korea's former president Roh Moo-hyun, and also sang along to lyrics of the song "Dear American" by South Korean rock band N.EX.T, which criticizes the United States military for its actions in the Iraq war. An initial translation of the lyrics was posted by an iReporter unto CNN's iReport site. Some of the lyrics, referring to the guards who tortured Iraqi prisoners, were inaccurately translated by CNN as follows: "Kill those fucking Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture," and "Kill Yankees' daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers / Kill them all slowly and painfully." It was later revealed that the actual Korean lyrics did not include the word "Yankee" or any other pejorative referring specifically to Americans.
A few days later "The Washington Post" raised questions about the accuracy of the translation of the lyrics into English, which originated from CNN's citizen journalism initiative iReport. Max Fisher of "The Washington Post" foreign staff reported that he solicited native Korean and English speakers, academics accustomed to the sensitivity of word-for-word translations, young Koreans familiar with the cultural connotations of the lyrics, and a professional interpreter to offer their translation of the lyrics, and found out that the lyrics may have actually slurred the American servicemen rather than calling for their deaths, although he did also go on to opine that, "using a racial slur to accuse Americans of killing Iraqis’ family members is still pretty serious". Fisher also states that the word translated 'Yankee' in the CNN iReport was underplayed, with one Korean American describing the slur as an "nearly untranslatable" racist “epithet,” perhaps best approximated as “foreign barbarian.” Fisher notes that one translator indicates that the slur is meant as "a derogatory term for American", and that others have translated the slur alternately as "Yankee", "big nose", and "despicable Western women and men".
Although Psy's actions did not receive any significant international media coverage at that time, this changed after the media reported about it in early December 2012. On December 7, 2012, Psy issued an apology directed towards members of the U.S. military and to the American people for his "inflammatory and inappropriate" language, and expressed hope that the American public would accept his apology.
Despite initial public outrage, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told the media that U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will attend Psy's performance at the "Christmas in Washington" charity concert as planned. As a result of the controversy, a petition circulated on the website of the White House demanding that he be dropped from the concert, although the petition was deleted later in the day because the White House website claimed that the petition violated the website's terms of participation. "Time" magazine's Nick Carbone asserted that it is "unlikely that these newly dug-up anecdotes will depose Psy from his king-like level of stardom" although Carbone did go on to write that the atmosphere at the White House concert would be "somewhat subdued."
Malaysian political rally.
Psy was invited to perform on February 11, 2013 in Penang, Malaysia for the ruling Barisan Nasional party in an attempt to reach out to young voters in the area. Media reports estimated a cost of at least US$300,000 for the performance. Opposition backers called for supporters of the Democratic Action Party to attend wearing opposition colors. Despite the controversy and calls by Malaysian citizens to cancel the concert, Psy completed a Chinese New Year open house performance at Han Chiang School for a crowd of 100,000.
Following the concert, a media report revealed that Psy received death threats prior to entering the country and this was the reason for the delay in Psy's on-stage appearance. Psy eventually performed for ten minutes to an excited crowd. The media report also reported on a press conference at the Jelutong Gerakan Chinese New Year open house that revealed that questions were raised over the financing of the event. State Barisan Nasional (BN) party chief Teng Chang Yeow explained that the event "was sponsored by private sponsors who preferred to remain anonymous as they are afraid of being ‘victimised' if their identities were revealed." Teng also stated that he was given the choice of a Justin Bieber visit, but chose Psy as he didn't know who Bieber was at the time.
Questionable song title and revision of lyrics.
In March 2013, South Korean media reported that the title of Psy's upcoming single would contain the word "Assarabia", a slang used by South Koreans to express thrills, or simply to describe something satisfying. There were numerous objections to that upcoming title, and worries have risen that people of Arabic descent might misinterpret the title and find it derogatory.
After being questioned by a correspondent of the Voice of America about the upcoming track's potential to offend, Psy voiced out that there has been some misunderstanding and his upcoming song will undergo a major revamp. On March 19, 2013, he revised his song's title and lyrics over "worries it could offend Arabs". Many people consider the change of his song title deliberate, aimed solely at building publicity for a strong follow-up to "Gangnam Style". He subsequently renamed the song "Gentleman" and released it on April 12, 2013.
Reported earnings.
The American news agency Associated Press reported that Psy is set to become a millionaire from YouTube advertisements and iTunes downloads, which underlines a shift in how money is being made in the music business. According to the AP analysis, he is expected to make only $60,000 from downloads and streams of "Gangnam Style" in South Korea, due to the fact that many South Koreans use a music streaming service that costs less than $10 a month, and results in the cost of a downloaded song being about $0.10 and a streamed song being $0.02. The bulk of Psy's earnings, however, originate from other sources such as TV commercials and YouTube revenue, the latter generating almost US $1 million for 33,000 parodies and related videos identified in September 2012 by YouTube's automatic identification system. In total, AP estimated that Psy will earn at least US $8.1 million in 2012.

Tehilla Lichtenstein

Tehilla Lichtenstein (1893 – 1973) was a cofounder and leader of Jewish Science, as well as an author. She was born in Jerusalem and immigrated to America when she was eleven years old. Her parents were Hava (Cohen) and Rabbi Haim Hirshenson. She earned a B.A. degree in Classics from Hunter College and an M.A. degree in literature from Columbia University.
Tehilla originally ran the religious school of the Society of Jewish Science in New York, where she also taught Hebrew and Bible. She became the spiritual leader of the Society of Jewish Science when her husband Morris, who had been its leader, died in 1938. Morris's will had declared that the position should go to one of their sons, or to Tehilla if neither of their sons was willing, which as it turned out they were not. Thus Tehilla became the first Jewish American woman to serve as the spiritual leader of an ongoing Jewish congregation. On December 4, 1938, Tehilla gave her first sermon as the new leader of the Society of Jewish Science. It was entitled “The Power of Thought.” According to the "New York Times", which covered the event, over five hundred people attended this sermon. She continued to preach from the pulpit until 1972.

Pskov Viceroyalty

Pskov Viceroyalty () was an administrative division (a "namestnichestvo") of the Russian Empire, which existed in 1777–1796. The seat of the Viceroyalty was located in Pskov. Both the predecessor and the successor of the viceroyalty was Pskov Governorate. In terms of modern administrative division of Russia, the area of the viceroyalty is currently split between Pskov, Leningrad, Tver, and Novgorod Oblasts. 
History.
Pskov Governorate with the seat in the town of Opochka was established in 1772 to accommodate vast areas transferred to the Russian Empire as the result of the First Partition of Poland. The governorate was too big for practical governance, and in 1776, it was divided into Pskov (with the seat in Pskov) and Polotsk Governorates. According to the general line of the administrative reforms by Catherine the Great, on 23 August 1777 the governorate was transformed into viceroyalty. Simultaneously, Luga (newly founded), Kholm, and Novorzhev (formerly Arshansky Stan) obtained the town status, and Izborsk, though retained the town status, ceased to be the center of an uyezd. The vice-royalty was subdivided into ten uyezds,
On 11 November 1777 Gdovsky and Luzhsky Uyezds were transferred to Saint Petersburg Governorate, and on 7 June 1782 Pechorsky Uyezd, with the administrative center in Pechory, was established by splitting Pskovsky Uyezd.
In 1796, Paul I performed a new administrative reform. Kholmsky, Novorzhevsky, and Pechorsky Uyezds were abolished, and the viceroyalty was transformed into Pskov Governorate in the same borders.
Governors.
The administration of the viceroyalty was performed by a "namestnik" (vice-roy) and controlled by a governor general. The governors of Pskov Viceroyalty were

Galson is a member of the New York Association of Approved Environmental Laboratories. Galson is also one of fewer than 250 laboratories to qualify for the Industrial Hygiene Laboratory Accreditation Program.
History.
Galson Laboratories was founded by Allen Galson in 1970 in Syracuse, New York. The company was created in direct response to the emerging industrial hygiene market caused by environmental regulations posed by OSHA.
In 1994, Michael Lorenz and Lee Davis, two Galson employees, purchased the company from its founders. In 1996, the two sold the business off in two pieces. Massachusetts-based environmental engineering firm ENSR International bought Galson's engineering operations. F. Joseph Unangst purchased Galson's laboratory operations and continued operating it under the Galson Laboratories name.
In 2004, Galson expanded its operations to loaning and renting air quality test equipment. Clients collect air samples from sites, and then send the samples to Galson for analysis.
Product offerings.
Galson Laboratories offers analytical laboratory testing services. The company rents industrial hygiene equipment directly to customers. It also offers air and sample analysis and lab services.
Major projects.
In 2007, Galson conducted a study finding dangerous amounts of lead in household enamel paint samples.
In 2008, Galson tested wooden playground equipment at the Lake Placid Elementary school, finding high levels of arsenic.
In 2010, Galson did heavy work related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It sent out 2,500 test kits to test the air quality in the aftermath of the spill.

Blandine Verlet

Blandine Verlet (born Paris, February 27, 1942) is a harpsichordist and a harpsichord teacher. Born into a musical family, she was the seventh of ten children, and in 1957 gained admission to the Paris Conservatoire, studying piano and harpsichord. Having decided on her specialism, she studied harpsichord with Huguette Dreyfus in Paris, Ruggero Gerlin in Siena and Ralph Kirckpatrick in the US. A significant competition prize in Paris in 1963 led to engagements in Italy and West Germany.
Verlet has been widely praised for her recordings of Bach, including the 'Goldberg Variations', but it is perhaps in the music of her compatriot Francois Couperin that she displays exceptional sensitivity and imagination. Verlet recorded Couperin's complete works in the 1970s and 80s, and in late 2011 she returned to re-record five 'ordres' on the period Henri Hemsch harpsichord. Verlet wrote a poem in celebration of Couperin which accompanied the release, the closing lines of which exemplify her great imaginative empathy with this key French composer:

<doc id="36524590" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36524590" title="International Harvester Light Line pickup">
International Harvester Light Line pickup

The International D-Series (1000-1500) replaced the C-Series as International's Light Line range of pickup trucks in early 1969, for a shortened model year. The name started out as a simple continuation of the previous A-, B-, and C-series trucks. It was largely a rebodied version of its predecessors, with a square-rigged look very similar to the period Scout utility vehicle. The Travelall underwent parallel changes to the Light Line trucks. The light line of trucks was marked by a larger range of transmission and wheelbase options than any of its competitors, and in general the lineup aimed to maximize adaptability. The Light Line was also available as a bare chassis, for special purpose applications. Production ended without replacement in late April 1975, as a hard-pressed International chose to focus on the Scout and on heavier machinery.
1000D-Series.
Sold as the 1000 through 1500 D-series, the Light Line pickup was originally offered with four of International Harvester's own V8s, with displacements of 266, 304, 345 or 392 cubic inches. AMC's 232 ci inline-six engine had also been available, since the 1968 C-Series. Several different wheelbases (115, 119, 131, 132, 149, 156, or 164 inches) were also offered. The 119 inch version (as used for the Travelall) was only available as a bare chassis. In addition to the regular cab pickup, station wagon "Travelall" bodywork was also available, as was a four-door panel van version of the wagon and a four-door crew cab pickup called the "Travelette" (only on the 149 or 164 inch wheelbase). The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with a column shift, but there were also four- and five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatics, with floor-mounted shifters optional. The automatic transmission was not available in heavier duty models such as the 1300D and the rare 1500D. Several models were also available as a cab on a bare frame for construction of stake-bed or other applications, some with an optional dual-wheel rear end, with available load ratings up to seven tons. These larger models were not popular, with most buyers opting instead for the Loadstar models.
1010-Series.
For 1971 the Light Line underwent a slight styling change, now with a plastic grille. The naming system also changed, with the "D" being dropped and with a "10" being added in the series number. Thus, the new trucks were labelled 1010 through 1510, depending on weight ratings. The engine range was the same as for the earlier pickups, although AMC's 258 six was added later in 1971. The smaller 232 was dropped for 1972, as was the 266 V8 which had still been available in early 1971. From that year on a metal grille with five horizontal bars and a slim central vertical opening was installed instead of the previous plastic unit. As IH's own engines were temporarily in short supply due to the success of the Loadstar medium-duty truck, some 1973 and 1974 pickup trucks received AMC's 401 ci V8 engine instead (called the V-400 on International's option list). The crew cab Travelette was only available on the 1210 series.
The 1010 and 1110 have the same weight rating, the difference being in the front suspension: independent, by torsion-bars, for the 1010, and of a solid I-beam construction for the 1110 (and all heavier versions). A first for the segment was the option of a Bendix anti-lock brake system called Adaptive Braking System by International. Operating only on the rear wheels, it was made available the pickups (and Travelalls) in late 1971. Due to the expense of this novel system, it was a rarely selected option. 
100-series.
For 1974 the naming changed yet again: the trucks were now called 100, 150, 200, or 500 depending on the weight rating. External changes were minimal, consisting mainly of a new five-bar metal grille without the vertical dividers, nicknamed the "electric razor grille". The heavy duty one-ton 500 was only available as a single-cab pickup, and the 150 was only available with IHC's own line of V8 engines. The Travelette crew cab was no longer available with four-wheel drive. The program was gradually whittled away, with only the ¾ ton 150 and 200-Series (and heavy-duty 500s) remaining by the time the 1975s were introduced. By then, only IHC's own V8s were still available, with the claimed outputs down to SAE net. There were two wheelbases available for the regular cab (115 or 132 inches), and two for the Travelette (149 or 166 inches). The beds were either a standard unit or the "Bonus Load" bed.
In the end, however, Pickup (and Travelall) production ended on 28 April 1975, with only about 6,000 made. The last one built was an all-wheel drive IH 500 cab and chassis, built in IHC's Springfield factory. The Light Line was unable to compete with the Big Three in the light truck market; IHC's market share in this segment had never been higher than 9.5% and had dropped to 4.1% by 1969. Corporate infighting and the 1973-1974 oil crisis served to further undermine International's market, meaning that the Light Line had to be discontinued in spite of the marketing efforts of recently added executive Keith Mazurek (previously of Chrysler Canada). The oil crisis particularly affected International's working trucks, which were the heaviest and least fuel efficient in the market. Another issue of concern was the truck-centered nature of International's dealers, while most competing light trucks were beginning to be sold to suburban buyers in more alluring and better located auto show rooms. International Harvester instead chose to focus on heavier trucks and the popular Scout, which continued to be built until 1980.

Paul Séjourné

Paul Séjourné (December 21, 1851; Orléans – January 19, 1939; Paris) was a French engineer who specialized in the construction of large bridges from masonry, a domain in which he made some important innovations.
Biography.
Paul Séjourné graduated from the "École polytechnique" in 1873 and the civil engineering grande école "École nationale des Ponts et Chaussées" (ENPC) in 1876, he was appointed "Ingénieur des ponts et chaussées" in Mende in 1877, then in Toulouse in 1890. In these two positions, Séjourné was responsible for the planning and construction of several railway lines. He made his reputation with innovative methods, and 1886 was decorated with the Légion d'honneur, with the citation 'has designed and built on several railway lines in planning or under construction long span bridges which should be considered as a basis for design'.
Between 1890 and 1893, Séjourné took time off from public service to work for the Fives-Lille company in Spain. In 1896 he left the civil service and joined the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) as chief engineer based in Dijon, all the while continuing to lead other important projects such as the Adolphe Bridge in Luxembourg. He became chief of the construction department of the PLM in 1909. In 1916, Marshal Lyautey named him director of the Moroccan railways. He then returned to the PLM as vice-director in 1919 before retiring at 76 with the title of honorary director.
Between 1901 and 1922, Séjourné taught the construction of large masonry bridges at the ENPC and published a 6 volume manual "Grandes Voûtes" ('Great Arches) which brought together all his knowledge on the subject. After winning the Caméré prize in 1918, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1924. In 1926 he was promoted to 'grand officer of the Légion d'honneur'.
A street of the 6th arrondissement of Paris where Paul Séjourné once lived is named in his honor.
Technical Contributions.
Paul Séjourné developed some technical innovations :
Design and calculation of Centring : Séjourné demonstrated the value of constructing arches by parallel sections, so that the centering only had to support the weight of the section under construction. When a section was complete it bore its own weight and the centering could then support the weight of the next section. The Romans used this technique to limit the cost of the centring but since the Renaissance period it had become standard to make centring that could support the full load of the arch and construct the arch in one go. Séjourné showed that the older technique was perfectly viable and could lower the weight and cost of the centering by up to 70%.
He then introduced twin arches to support a single deck on the Adolph bridge. The weight of the arches is significantly lower, thus reducing the force on the buttresses. He repeated the technique on the Pont des Amidonniers in Toulouse. This technique became widely adopted outside France and was known as the 'Séjourné design'.
While his contemporaries such as Gustav Eiffel resorted systematically to metalwork, Séjourné continued to design and build large span arch bridges in masonry until the end of the 1920s. Thereafter it became cheaper to build with concrete.
Works.
Paul Séjourné participated in the following works as:
Designer.
1884 : "Pont Antoinette" (known as "pont de l’Aiguillou") in Sémalens, Lavaur railway bridge, "pont de Saint-Waast" at Couffouleux, all three on the Montauban-Ville-Bourbon to La Crémade line.

Ella sigue de viaje

Ella sigue de viaje ("She travels on") is the second book published by Mexican writer Luis Felipe Lomelí, published in 2005. It is best known for the opening short story named "El emigrante" ("The Emigrant"), a flash fiction story which consist only of the four words "¿Olvida usted algo? -¡Ojalá! " ("Forget something? -If only!").
Themes.
The book opens with "El emigrante", one of the most celebrated and frequently cited of microfictions.
It is considered the shortest story in the Spanish language.
The story may be seen as a summary of the feelings of the characters in the other twelve stories in the book,
whether they have left behind love, loneliness or violence.
The subject matter of these stories range from romantic love encounters to adultery, with lovers looking to expand their sexuality in random encounters, to relationships with hopelessness and violence, such as a police officer brutally beating his wife after suppressing a demonstration against the military dictatorship in Chile, a mother who abuses her son etc. The stories are set in a range of places from New York City to Valparaíso. One of the most important themes of the book is that violent society overshadows our love lives.
Reception.
The book was well received. In addition to the interest aroused by "El emigrante", the story "El cielo de Neuquén" (The Neuquén Sky) won the "Edmundo Valadés" Latin American Short Story Prize.
Apart from the recognition, the "Edmundo Valadés" award is worth $50,000 and a trip to the city of Puebla.
The book won the prestigious San Luis Potosí national short story award.
"El Emigrante" inspired the installation work "¿Olvida usted algo? – ¡Ojalá!" by artist Susana Rodríguez, 
which explores the dialectic between construction and destruction as an event that helps us understand and accept the transformation of life as inevitable.
Discussing the title, the artist observed that the four words in Lomelí's story generate many ideas, including ones on subjects you would not normally think about.
The story is a perfect title for the project, since one of the most important factors in evolution is learning, which is based on memory.

Directed by Ellis Bahl and starring actors Jonathan Dwyer, Jessica DiGiovanni, and Eleanor Pienta, it is the band's first official music video and was created to accompany the release of the song. The video features a violent fight in a darkened apartment between a male and a female character shown in reverse, beginning with the death of the female character at the hands of the male character, who bludgeons her with a breeze block (a reference to the single's title). As the fight progresses backwards, it is revealed that the female character is the aggressor in the fight, having ambushed the male character by restricting and concealing a second female character in a place where he would be distracted with her while she crept up on him with a knife. The video aired for the first time on YouTube on 23 March 2012. The video won a UK Music Video Award (UKMVA) for "Best Alternative Video" on 8 November 2012.

Osteodontokeratic culture

The Osteodontokeratic ("bone-tooth-horn", Greek and Latin derivation) culture (ODK) is a hypothesis that was developed by Prof. Raymond Dart (who identified the Taung child fossil in 1924, and published the find in "Nature" Magazine in 1925), which detailed the predatory habits of Australopith species in South Africa involving the manufacture and use of osseous implements. Dart envisaged "Australopithecus africanus", known from Taung and Sterkfontein caves, and "Australopithecus prometheus" (now classified as "Au. africanus") from Makapansgat, as carnivorous, cannibalistic predators who utilized bone and horn implements to hunt various animals, such as antelopes and primates, as well as other Australopiths.
History.
In 1947, Wilfred Eitzman (a local schoolteacher), visited the Makapansgat Limeworks in Limpopo, South Africa, where he collected a number of fossil remains, including those of extinct baboon species, which originated from the Australopith-bearing, Member 3 Grey breccia layers. Eitzman promptly sent some of this fossil material to Prof. Raymond Dart at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for thorough inspection. Dart examined 58 baboon skulls from Eitzman's collections, and recognized a repeated pattern of depressed fractures on the cranial vaults of a number these specimens. Consistent with this pattern, he also found that 4 out of the 6 known Australopith skulls from the Member 3 layers showed similar cranial fractures, although Dart struggled to find an adequate explanation that would account for the frequency of this damage. Eventually Dart concluded that this pattern could have only resulted from “purposeful violence…inflicted by implements held in the hands,” suggesting that southern African Australopiths used long bones (e.g. femurs and humeri), mandibles, horn cores, etc. as hunting weaponry to satisfy their hyper-carnivorous diets (1949). Thus, the ODK hypothesis implied that the rise of the "Australopithecus" genus from 'hominoid' to 'hominin,' meaning from an ‘ape-adaptive grade’ to a more ‘human-adaptive grade,’ was borne from the ability of early hominin species to use tools, more specifically weapons.
Dart published numerous journal articles on the subject of the ODK hypothesis, which received considerable backlash from his contemporaries. In 1957, he released a comprehensive volume entitled, "The Osteodontokeratic Culture of Australopithecus prometheus" which outlined his arguments for the validity of the "predatory transition from Ape to Man" (see Dart 1953). To justify his arguments, Dart relied on critical lines of evidence that substantiated the validity of ODK culture, although his critics would eventually turn his evidence against him to refute the hypothesis altogether (see below). Dart suggested that the breakage patterns of the so-called bone implements from the Member 3 Grey breccia layers from Makapansgat displayed evidence of being purposefully broken by the early Australopiths, through cracking and twisting, while fresh. Dart's opinion was that this damage was in no way characteristic of predatory or scavenging animals (e.g. hyenas), and so must have been the result of early hominin dietary activities, mostly likely to access marrow. Furthermore, after the analysis of over 7,000 faunal remains from the Member 3 Grey breccia material, Dart found a statistical over-representation of certain skeletal elements, such as distal humeri, metapodial bones and mandibles. He concluded that such skewed representational patterns could have only resulted from the selection and transportation of fleshy carcass parts of animals into the Makapansgat cave system by Australopiths. Lastly, Dart assigned specific tool uses to different bones elements, e.g. a 'mace' for antelope humeri, etc., similar to the manner in which Mary Leakey created tool types to account for various core morphologies in the Oldowan assemblages at Olduvai Gorge.
Initial criticisms & Dart's rebuttal.
Immediately after the initial publication of Dart’s ODK hypothesis in 1949, a number of his colleagues refuted the idea as an example of interpretation beyond the limits of scientific evidence. Dr. Wilfrid Le Gros Clark (1957) criticized Dart's "over-emphatic" writing style, and suggested that his hypothesis relied mainly on the fact that no other feasible hypothesis could make sense of the evidence Dart had complied, rather than on the meticulousness of the scientific methods that Dart used to corroborate the existence of the ODK culture.
More notably, Dr. Sherwood Washburn had conducted field research in the Wankie Game Reserve in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he observed lion kills that were subsequently scavenged by smaller carnivores (e.g. hyenas, jackals and wild dogs). Washburn noted that the process of prey dis-articulation, and in some cases transport, by carnivores was a highly selective process, which produced similar skeletal part representation patterns to those that Dart found in the Member 3 bone assemblages from Makapansgat (cf. Maguire "et al". 1980). He published the now well-known article "Australopithecus: The Hunters or the Hunted?" (1957) based upon this research, in which Washburn suggested that southern African Australopiths did not actually hunt other animal species, but rather were hunted and accumulated by cave-dwelling carnivores, most likely by hyenas. This was supported by the presence of two extinct hyenid species found in the Member 3 Grey breccia material, "Pachycrocuta brevirostris" and "Hyaena makapani", as well as the abundance of hyena coprolites within these layers (which had been well-known at the time). Thus, Washburn refuted Dart's ODK hypothesis based upon the same lines of evidence used to support it, and suggested that various hyena species were more likely responsible for the accumulation of bone material in the Australopith-bearing layers at Makapansgat.
Despite such refutations, Dart defended the ODK hypothesis for some time relying upon fieldwork conducted by some of his colleagues that seemed to dismiss the claims of Washburn and others, most notably the hyena bone-collector hypothesis. For example, Alun Hughes (1954), then Dart's assistant, undertook research in the Kruger National Park, South Africa to investigate the bone accumulation habits of hyenid species, reporting that hyenas did not seem to amass bone material inside their dens, and instead consumed prey directly after the kill or in open-air scavenging sites with little evidence of transport behavior (see Dart 1965). Thus, Dart rebutted Washburn's criticisms in arguing that the early Australopiths must have been responsible for the bone accumulations at Makapansgat due to the abundant amount of faunal material found within the cave system, as well as the nature of the breakage patterns. Coupled with the discovery of stone tool assemblages thought to be associated with the robust Australopith species ("Zinjanthropus boisei," now classified under the genus "Paranthropus") from Olduvai Gorge by Mary and Louis Leakey, this amounting evidence seemed to sway the argument in Dart’s favor. Furthermore, Dr. John T. Robinson (1959) (a colleague of Dr. Robert Broom at the Transvaal Museum, and a co-founder of the famous adult "Au. africanus" skull Sts 5, known as Mrs. Ples), had found a bone tool at Sterkfontein he believed to be used by "Au. africanus", which also seemed to corroborate the ODK hypothesis.
However, Dart's refutation of the bone-collecting habits of hyenas was short-lived as an overwhelming body of research has found that hyenas do, in fact, accumulate bone material inside caves used as dens. Before Hughes's work in the Kruger National Park, modern zoological research focusing upon hyenas had never been correlated with palaeontological or palaeoanthropological studies of this nature. Due to the inception and on-going significance of taphonomic and palaeozoological research within these fields, it is now well-known and widely accepted that hyenid species transport and accumulate bone material within cave systems used as dens, which can ultimately result in fossil assemblages (see Maguire "et al". 1980 and Kuhn "et al". 2010).
The birth of African cave taphonomy.
Amidst the growing contention surrounding the validity of the ODK hypothesis, a young Southern Rhodesian (now Zimbabwe) researcher, Dr. Charles Kimberlin Brain ("Bob" Brain) became fascinated with Dart's work describing prehistory's "predatory ape-men", and conducted research upon the bone breakage and skeletal element representation patterns expounded in Dart's writings (see above). Brain (1967) examined the remains of goat bones within Hottentot villages in Namibia, finding that the skeletal element representation patterns, which formed the crux of Dart's support for the ODK culture, were more simply explained by the durability and resistance of certain bone elements to soil-chemical weathering and the consumption habits of carnivores. This stimulated Brain's interest in how such patterns within cave systems might be affected by the weight, density, cortical thickness and size of bones in relation to weathering and erosion processes.
In 1965, Brain took over the directorship of Swartkrans cave (next to Sterkfontein caves) and found a very similar skeletal element representation pattern of fossil faunal remains (including ungulates, primates, large carnivores and hominins) to that of the Makapansgat Member 3 Grey breccia assemblages. This confirmed Brain’s earlier work that skeletal element representation patterns were more likely generated from factors relating to the resilience of bone to weathering, carnivore damage and diagenesis. Further, he found that the breakage patterns from faunal remains at Swartkrans were consistent with large carnivore damage upon bone, such as leopards and hyenas. During Brain's excavations, he found a partial skull-cap of a juvenile "Paranthropus robustus" (SK 54) bearing two puncture marks (1970). Brain found that these punctures aligned perfectly with the spacing of the canines in a leopard mandible. He then summarized the findings of his research spanning nearly 20 years in the authoritative volume entitled, "Hunters or the Hunted?: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy" (1981) (named after Washburn's famous article, see above), which corroborated Washburn's hypothesis that early Australopiths were not, in fact, responsible for associated fossil accumulations found throughout southern Africa. It instead demonstrated the fact that large carnivore species had played a much more important role in the origination of fossil deposit (especially in the Sterkfontein Valley) bearing Plio-Pleistocene hominin remains, and further that early Australopiths, as Washburn proposed many years ago, were preyed upon by large carnivores and were not actually predators themselves. Subsequently, Brain's work has engendered a body of on-going research critical to our understanding of early hominin species and the ecosystems in which they lived. Brain’s volume contains an excellent summary of Dart's development of the ODK hypothesis, as well as his detailed refutation to it, which is now recognized as disproving Dart's ideas of the "predatory transition from Ape to Man."
Popular references.
Robert Ardrey's "African Genesis" (1961), which popularized concurrent viewpoints on the evolution of modern humans, contains numerous references to Dart’s ODK hypothesis. He detailed Dart's evidence for the predatory rise of Australopiths from "Ape to Man" as the major factor from which modern behavior emerged.
One of the most well-known popular references to Dart’s ODK hypothesis was captured in Stanley Kubrick's film "" (an adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's short story "The Sentinel", who also co-authored the screenplay with Kubrick) in which the first part of the film depicts early hominin "ape-men" as herbivorous animals being preyed upon by leopards (note the possible reference to Brain's work, see above). Then a black monolithic structure ascends from the sky, which is inspected and touched by the ape-men who start shrieking and are thrown into a frenzy. One 'ape-man' spontaneously starts to use a bone as a tool, more specifically a weapon, which they use to retake a waterhole, suggesting the ‘dawn of human culture’ began from an extraterrestrial source.
More recently, Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi, the 34th Grandmaster of Tokagure-Ryu Ninjutsu, and founder of the Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu association, briefly discussed Dart's ODK hypothesis as a possible scientific explanation for the continuity of the use of weapons throughout human history (2005).

Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands

The Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands is a permanent body within the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands which determines policies and directs the apostolic mission within the Netherlands. It is governed by bishops from around the country.
The Dutch Catholic Church has an archbishopric and six suffragan dioceses under it as well as a Military Ordinariate. An archbishop stands alone at the head of the archdiocese, but he is not the "boss" of his fellow bishops or their dioceses. Each diocese has a bishop (ordinary) and some dioceses also have one or more auxiliary bishops.
If the diocese is sede vacante, then a diocesan administrator is designated. This does not necessarily have to be a bishop and sometimes is the vicar-general. If a non-bishop is diocesan administrator, he will attend meetings of the bishops' conference, but is not a voting member.
The apostolic nuncio usually attends meetings of the Bishops' Conference, but he is not a member of it because he is not a bishop of a diocese within the Netherlands. The nuncio represents the Holy See.
The Netherlands Bishops' Conference is usually chaired by a bishop with the highest rank, such as the Archbishop, but this is not mandatory. When Wim Eijk took offices as archbishop of Utrecht in 2008, he chose not to assume the presidency, in order to have more time for his work as archbishop. Therefore, Ad van Luyn was the President and Frans Wiertz the Vice-President (the two 'seniores "among the seven bishops).
Today Wim Eijk is President and Frans Wiertz is Vice-President.
Positions Within the Bishops' Conference.
Policy Sectors.
The Bishops Conference has established a nine policies which referent is still a bishop, assisted by a secretary.
Fields.
In addition to the policies is a five thematic fields set, which is still a bishop referent.
Former members.
There are eight Emeritus Bishop, but Jan Gijsen of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond is missing from this list, since he last ruled a diocese that is not under the Dutch Catholic church province. There are also other Dutch bishops that a non-Dutch diocese boards.
Secretariat.
The Secretariat of the Bishops Conference and the Dutch Church Province is conducted by the Secretariat of the Roman Catholic Communion (SRKK). The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General. Since June 2, 2012 this has been Rev. Mr. (deacon) Hans Nijhuis.

Its closest living relatives are the giant anteater ("Myrmecophaga tridactyla") and tamanduas (genus "Tamandua"). The species "Neotamandua borealis" was suggested to be an ancestor of the giant anteater. Patterson (1992) suggested the "Neotamandua" fossils are so similar to "Myrmecophaga" and "Neotamandua" may be congeneric with "Myrmecophaga".

American Braille

American Braille was a popular braille alphabet used in the United States before the adoption of standardized English braille in 1918. It was the alphabet used by Helen Keller. Rather than ordering the letters numerically, as was done in French Braille and the (reordered) English Braille also used in the US at the time, in American Braille the letters were partially reassigned by frequency, with the most-common letters being written with the fewest dots. This significantly improved writing speed with the slate and stylus, which wrote one dot at a time, but lost its advantage with the braille typewriters that became practical after 1950.

Harald Penrose

Harald Penrose, O.B.E, CEng, F.R.Ae.S, A.M.I.N.A was chief test pilot at Westland Aircraft Ltd (from 1931 to 1953), a naval architect, and an aviation author. His flying experience spanned man carrying kites before the First World War, to early jet fighters and helicopters. He designed, built and flew his own glider in the 1930s, designed 36 boats and yachts, and wrote many books describing his flying career and the history of British aviation.
Early life.
Harald James Penrose was born in Hereford on 12 April 1904. His fascination with manned flight started at an early age when his father showed him pictures of Bleriot's monoplane. He first flew aged 7 in a man-lifting kite. His first powered flight was in 1919, in a modified three seat Avro 504K, piloted by Alan Cobham.
When he left school in 1920, he was unable to find an apprenticeship in the aircraft industry, so on the advice of Frederick Handley Page, he attended the aeronautical engineering course at Northampton Engineering College London University. During a visit to de Havilland he flew in the prototype Moth as a passenger, piloted by Hubert Broad. As part of his course he undertook industrial placements working for Handley Page Ltd and Westland Aircraft Ltd.
Aviation career.
After graduation in 1926 Penrose was employed by Westland Aircraft Ltd. He started work on the shop floor, later working as an observer for the test pilot Lawrence Openshaw, then as assistant to Capt. Geoffrey Hill supervising the construction of the Widgeon III prototype.
In 1927 he took 3 months unpaid leave and learnt to fly with Reserve of Air-Force Officers (RAFO) at Filton. There he first flew Bristol PTMs and later in a Bristol Jupiter Fighter. During this training he met Cyril Uwins after the latter's encounter with control reversal in a Bristol Bagshot. Later, Uwins would mentor Penrose in the science of flight testing and they would become good friends.
On returning to Westlands he was employed working between the Works and the Design Office. Under the guidance of Westland's new test pilot, Louis Paget, Penrose became involved in test flying. He gained his A-licence which allowed him to fly as a private pilot and he flew Widgeons at weekend air displays, eventually becoming responsible for all Widgeon testing.
In 1928 he was appointed manager for civil aircraft and the managing director's (Robert Bruce) principal assistant at a salary of £400 per annum. While his main duty was the production of civil aircraft such as the Wessex he was later involved in test flying experimental Wapitis.
In 1931 he was sent to Argentina to demonstrate the Wapiti float plane but failed to secure any sales. He returned to England, took ten days leave but was recalled to Westlands after Paget was injured while performing low altitude aerobatics. This accident finished Paget's career but resulted in Penrose being promoted to chief test pilot. 
Test pilot.
As Westland's chief test pilot, Harald Penrose established a number of unusual aviation records in the 1930s. He made one of the longest emergency glides in 1933, when the Westland Wallace, being prepared for the Huston Everest flight, suffered a fuel pump failure at 37,500 ft. He made the first parachute escape from an aircraft with an enclosed canopy in 1934 when the Westland PV.7 suffered a structural failure during diving trials. This was his first and only decent by parachute. And in the 1930s he accumulated the most flying hours in tailless aircraft, specifically the Pterodactyl IV and V.
In amongst the test flying he found the time to design and construct (with the aid of his wife, who stitched the fabric covering) the Penrose Pegasus glider. To get a performance comparison, he flew at the August 1935 BGA competition at Sutton Bank, accumulating a total of 6 hours 25 minutes. Up to the outbreak of war, the Pegasus was flown at Kimmeridge when the weather was not compatible with sailing.
In the late 1930s, Westlands developed the Lysander and the Whirlwind. Penrose's first flight in the Lysander was in June 1936. This and subsequent flights identified problems that required modification to the tail, The problems with the tailplane incidence were not solved to Harald's satisfaction and may have led to a number of fatal accidents.
Prior to flying the Whirlwind, to get experience of aircraft with high wing loadings and retractable undercarriages, Harald flew the Spitfire prototype K5054, the Fairey Battle prototype and a Bristol Blenheim. The first flight in the Whirlwind (October 1936) was unintentional when he became airborne during a straight high speed run, The early test flights were uneventful but in early 1939 a fractured exhaust burnt through the right aileron push rod at 200 ft, requiring instinctive action. This incident caused Teddy Petter to design a less aerodynamic but safer exhaust system.
Second world war.
As a reserve officer in the RAF, Penrose expected to be called up at the start of the war. However, at 36 and with valuable experience of test flying he was turned down by the RAF's personnel department. Instead, he returned to Lysander and Whirlwind development.
There were plans to use the Lysander for ground strafing during an invasion or as a night fighter. He tested various modified Lysanders fitted with gun turrets, including the tandem wing Lysander fitted with a tail gun turret.
In January 1942 he tested the last production Whirlwind, by then the main work at Westland was manufacturing Spitfires and Penrose was responsible for their production test flying.
During the war, Penrose had three encounters with the Messerschmitt 109. In first occasion he was testing a production Whirlwind, when emerging from cloud, he realized he was on a collision course with a Messerschmitt and slammed the Whirlwind nose back into the cloud. On the second, he was with his family sailing their dingies 'Tittermouse' and 'Tiddlywinks, when they were buzzed by a low flying German. However, in 1943 he flew a captured aircraft being tested by Rolls Royce. In his memoir he described how he 'froze on the controls and flew very, very straight' when he was intercepted by a RAF Spitfire.
Based on the Whirlwind, Westland developed the Welkin high altitude interceptor, Penrose flying the prototype in November 1942. He described how the cabin was 'like sitting in an oven' due to the unshielded cabin pressurisation blowers. He developed pneumonia in early 1943 which he attributed to the extreme changes in temperature on leaving the Welkins cabin drenched in sweat and the bitter wind across the airfield. He survived thanks to the recently discovered M&B drug. As a result of this illness Petter devised a better method for cooling the cabin. Penrose contrasted the arctic conditions in the open cockpits of the PV.3/Wallace during the high altitude flights with the 'delightfully warm' cabin of the Welkin, describing these flights as the 'peak of experience'.
In the summer of 1945, he flew a Gloster Meteor as a guest of 616 Squadron. He described it as 'far easier and safer machine than that superb fighter the Spitfire'. But the experience was marred during landing by uncertainty that the undercarriage had locked down while simultaneously running low on fuel.
Post war.
Wyvern.
After the war, Penrose led the flight testing of the Westland Wyvern. No other contemporary aircraft proved so lethal as the Wyvern.
He attributed its problems to underdeveloped power plants in conjunction with a high wing loading and would later describe it as "one of those very nearly very good machines".
On 12 December 1946, he made the first flight in the Eagle engined prototype . This flight was uneventful, but early in 1947 he was forced to land it at grass airstrip at RAF Warmwell after an engine failure, narrowly missing a hidden concrete block. Other Westland test pilots were not so lucky. Sqn. Ldr. Peter Garner was killed on 15 October 1947 after the failure of the contra-rotating propeller bearing and Sqn. Ldr. Mike Graves was killed on 31 October 1949 after an engine failure in the Python powered prototype. Extraordinarily, Penrose's luck held out and he survived three further emergency landings, one in the summer of 1947 due to an aileron push rod failure, one in October 1951 due to hydraulic failure, the third in February 1952 after an engine failure.
It was probably attention to detail (such as wire locking the harness release lock) rather than luck that allowed Harald Penrose to pursue 25 years of test flying in reasonable safety.
Rotorcraft.
Under the encouragement of Arthur Davenport and Teddy Petter, Westland's had a long history with rotorcraft starting with the Cierva C.29. In preparation for this work Penrose took an autogyro conversion course at Cierva's Hanworth Air park in 1933, during which he added 10 hours of autogyro flying to his commercial licence. However, neither the Cierva C.29 or its successor the C.30 were successful and Penrose did not fly either of them. In 1944 when Westlands were considering post war business opportunities, Penrose suggested to Davenport that they cash in on their earlier experience of rotorcraft and investigate helicopters.
Subsequently he flew the Sikorsky S-51 under the supervision of Charles 'Sox' Hosegood. While he believed that he could assimilate the piloting techniques because of his earlier experience with autogyros he thought it was wise to get tuition from more experienced pilots, hence Westlands employed Alan Bristow to train Penrose and Peter Garner. Penrose went solo in the Sikorsky S-51 in 1947. In comparison with the Wyvern his flights in helicopters were infrequent, far less arduous and far less risky.
In 1953 after 25 years of test Harald retired from the role of chief test pilot to take over Westland's helicopter sales.
Writing career.
Harald demonstrated a talent for writing at an early age, winning his school's premier prize for literature. His early books drew on personal experiences, such as I Flew with the Birds (1949), No Echo in the Sky (1958), and Airymouse (1967), In his later works he wrote about the history of the British aircraft industry: Architect of Wings (1985), a biography of the Avro designer Roy Chadwick, Wings across the World (1980), a history of British Airways, and a five-volume history of British aviation.

Burnley Savings and Loans

Burnley Savings and Loans Limited trading under the slogan "Bank on Dave!" is an independent lending scheme based in Burnley, United Kingdom founded by David Fishwick, a successful minibus retailer, in September 2011. It aims to offer 5% AER on savings and to lend to local businesses at 8.9% to 14.9%, with no bonuses for the staff of seven. The company also wishes to be separate from regular high street banks.
It was set up in 2011 by Dave Fishwick, who felt that the current banking system was corrupt and needed change; he felt they weren't lending enough money to people or small businesses that needed a kick-start to get going, and that the rate of interest for savings was too low. As such, Fishwick decided to use an above-market 5% AER. All profits after overheads are given directly to charity. The business does not credit score and uses a common sense approach to underwriting all applications. In July 2012 it was reported that 0.5 percent of loans were in arrears.
There was trouble persuading the Financial Services Authority to grant Fishwick a banking licence and name it an actual bank. The naming found a loophole as Bank "on" Dave, officially an advertising slogan. He found premises in Burnley and it officially opened to the public with a ribbon-cutting ceremony with comedian Ted Robbins in September 2011. Allegedly, the key to the safe was previously kept behind a bottle of cherryade in a cupboard. Fishwick himself personally guarantees all money customers put in. The company has now reached its target of lending £250,000 a month and has a waiting list of new customers. 
Since the airing of the first series David Fishwick, on behalf of Burnley Savings and Loans, has been encouraging parliament for banking reform. This has been met with some degree of success with many leading political figures voicing their support. Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna has been quoted as saying “Dave said he can do so much, but in the end he needs the Government to get involved and turbo charge this at a national level. That is why we are looking at setting up a network of local banks like this which have the core of their mission to serve and grow the local economy rather than just for profit and serving the shareholders. The beauty of the Bank of Dave is we’ve got people coming here who have been rejected by the high street banks. The kind of relationship Dave has with the businesses - he knows them, he walks past them, he actually goes and visits the businesses and he understands their business models and can see whether they are successful or not”. Further support has been expressed by the Banking in Britain All Party Parliamentary Group chairman Steve Baker, who is quoted as saying “It is towards this model that the world should move.”
The process of starting the scheme was followed by a TV series named "Bank of Dave", which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 in July 2012, with a follow-up episode named "Bank of Dave: Fighting the Fat Cats" shown on 28 February 2013. Fishwick also wrote a book by the same title describing what the venture has entailed.

Kafr Qud (, also spelled Kafr Qad) is a Palestinian village in the Jenin Governorate in the northern West Bank, located west of Jenin. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, it had a population of 1,143 in 2007.
History.
The village is situated on an ancient site, with cisterns cut out of rock, and old stones reused in housing. Ceramics from the Byzantine area have been found.
In 1596 the village appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as "Kafr Qud", in the "nahiya" of Jabal Sami in the "liwa" of Nablus. It had a population of 19 households and 5 bachelors, all Muslim. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, occasional revenues, goats and beehives. Edward Robinson identified Kafr Qud with "Caparcotia" when he visited the village on 21 April 1844. On 14 June 1870 Victor Guérin noted that Kafr Qud was "hidden in the mountains with groves of olives and fig trees ... and very probably the place is Caparcotani of Ptolemy and the Peutinger map." He estimated the population to be 300. In 1882 Kafr Qud was described as a "good-sized village in a recess among the hills" in the Palestine Exploration Fund's "Survey of Western Palestine".
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kufr Qud had a population of 161; 8 Christians and 153 Muslims. This was almost unchanged in the 1931 census, when Kafr Qud had 41 occupied houses and a population of 162; 9 Christians and the rest Muslim. In 1945 the population was 250, with 5463 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. 908 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 2,170 dunams for cereals, while 14 dunams were built-up (urban) land.
Geography.
Kafr Qud is situated in the northern Dothan Valley on narrow ravine below the Jabal Shibli mountain to the north. It has an average elevation of 330 meters above sea level. The Bir al-Balad (also known as "Bir Kafr Qud") spring inside the village serves as the closest source of water. It is located south of the road connecting al-Hashimiya with Jenin, and nearby localities include the former to the northwest, Kufeirit to the southwest, al-Manshiyya to the south and Burqin to the east.
The ancient site in the middle of Kafr Qud is small and surrounded by a gully near the Bir al-Balad spring. Most of the modern housing was built east of the site, although ancient building material is highly present in some walls. In 1979 the built-up area of the village amounted to roughly 15 dunams.

Extreme Rules (2013)

Extreme Rules (2013) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on May 19, 2013 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the fifth event under the Extreme Rules chronology, with the event having originated in 2009. Eight matches took place on the event's card and one pre-show match was streamed on YouTube. The theme of the event was that most matches are contested under hardcore wrestling regulations.
The event received 231,000 buys, significantly down from last year's event of 263,000.
Background.
Extreme Rules featured professional wrestling matches that involve wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that play out on WWE television. Wrestlers portrayed villains or heroes as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
On the episode of "Raw" following WrestleMania 29, Alberto Del Rio lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Dolph Ziggler after Ziggler cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to take advantage of Del Rio being injured by Jack Swagger to become the new champion. Del Rio tried to invoke his rematch clause the following week, but was again impeded by Swagger. Senior Advisor Theodore Long then set up a match between Ziggler and Swagger, and Swagger won. SmackDown General Manager Booker T, irate at Long for going above him, rearranged the match into a triple threat match for the championship between Ziggler, Del Rio, and Swagger. On the April 29 edition of "Raw", Del Rio's personal ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez won a triple-threat match over Swagger's mentor Zeb Colter and Ziggler's bodyguard Big E Langston to pick the stipulation for the match, which would be a Ladder match selected by Del Rio. On the May 6 edition of "Raw", Del Rio defeated Ziggler via disqualification when Swagger attacked both men with a ladder, resulting in Ziggler suffering a legitimate concussion. Ziggler was removed from the PPV as a result of his injury, and the next week on "Raw", Long announced that Del Rio and Swagger would instead wrestle in an "I Quit" match, for the #1 contendership to the World Heavyweight Championship.
At WrestleMania 29, Triple H defeated Brock Lesnar in their rematch. Lesnar's manager, Paul Heyman, then issued one final match to settle things between Triple H and Lesnar: a steel cage match at Extreme Rules. On the April 22 episode of "Raw" in London, England, Triple H accepted the match by assaulting Heyman with a Pedigree. Two weeks later on "Raw", Lesnar would respond by coming to WWE headquarters and trashing Triple H's office and attacking nearby employees. The week after on "Raw", Triple H would come face to face with Lesnar, goading him in coming into the steel cage. Triple H would gain the upper hand and throw Lesnar into Heyman, resulting in both men retreating up to the ramp.
A day after Wrestlemania 29 on "Raw", John Cena, who defeated The Rock for the WWE Championship, would issue a challenge to anybody to face him for the title after news broke out that Rock would undergo surgery. Mark Henry would come forward and face him in a match for a shot at the title later in the night, but he would lose via count-out. Henry would assault Cena afterward until Ryback seemingly came to save Cena, but Ryback would attack Cena and hold the title up high. A week later, Ryback explained that he was living in Cena's shadow and Cena never helped him against The Shield. Ryback would watch The Shield attack Cena from the ramp. Prior to the April 22 edition of "Raw", it was announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship against Ryback. Later that night, Ryback would confront Mick Foley about his decision to attack Cena. Cena would come and save Foley, but The Shield would come out to attack the two men. Cena retreated up to the ramp to see Ryback get assaulted by The Shield, but he would assault all three members with a chair, forcing The Shield to retreat, and gave Ryback an Attitude Adjustment. On the May 6 edition of "Raw", Ryback would make the title match a Last Man Standing Match. Later that night, both John Cena and Ryback would drive away The Shield only for Ryback to attack Cena with a chair in retaliation. A week after on "Raw", Ryback would attack Cena and his injured Achilles tendon with a chair following Cena being attacked by The Shield after a six-man elimination match that ended in a disqualification win for Cena.
Mark Henry would attack Sheamus backstage twice on the April 12 edition of SmackDown and on the April 15 of "Raw". Sheamus would then attack Henry backstage as a result before going on to embarrass Henry in a tug of war on the April 29 edition of "Raw" and an arm wrestling contest on the May 3 edition of "SmackDown". A few days later on "Raw", both men agreed to a match on the pay-per-view. After Sheamus defeated Wade Barrett in a singles match, Henry would immediately attack Sheamus with a belt, ultimately making their match a strap match. A week later on "Raw", Sheamus would attack Henry with two leather straps.
After Big Show speared all three members of The Shield at WrestleMania 29, Randy Orton tagged himself and that gave The Shield the victory. Afterwards, Big Show knocked out both Orton and Sheamus. Both Orton and Sheamus would get their revenge on Show by defeating him twice in handicap matches on the April 12 edition of "SmackDown" and the April 15 edition of "Raw", but Show would team up with Mark Henry to defeat Sheamus and Orton on the April 19 edition of "SmackDown". On the May 3 edition of Smackdown, he defeated Damien Sandow in a singles match only afterwards for Big Show to interfere and Sandow attacked Orton post-match. After defeating Sandow in a second straight singles match three days later on "Raw", Show knocked out Orton as Orton was about to head to the locker room. Prior to the May 10 edition of "SmackDown", it was announced that Orton and Show would fight in an Extreme Rules match on the pay-per-view.
The Shield continued their reign of attacks on various superstars, particularly Team Hell No and United States Champion Kofi Kingston, who got pinned by Ambrose on the May 6th 2013 edition of "Raw". As a result, Dean Ambrose was to receive a title match against Kingston for the United States Championship, while Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns were to face Team Hell No for the Tag Team Championship.
A minor rivalry continued between Chris Jericho and Fandango when Jericho made fun of Fandango's name backstage on the March 22nd, 2013 edition of "Raw". Fandango would begin to interfere in Jericho's matches afterwards, setting a match (Fandango's debut match) between the two at WrestleMania 29, in which Fandango won. On the May 6th, 2013 edition of "Raw", Fandango would suffer his first loss via count-out to R-Truth when the judges (Jericho and Tons of Funk) gave Truth a much better rating as a dancer. A week later on "Raw", Jericho and Fandango would face off in a dance off, but Fandango's dance parter Summer Rae feigned an injury, which distracted Jericho and led to Fandango attacking him.
Event.
The first match on the card, broadcast for free as part of the pre-show, was between Cody Rhodes and The Miz. Miz defeated Cody using the Figure-Four Leg Lock after reversing two of Rhodes' attempts at Cross Rhodes.
The first match of the pay-per-view and second of the night was between Chris Jericho and Fandango. During the match, Fandango managed to make the ropes while Jericho had the Walls of Jericho locked in, but Jericho eventually picked up the win using the Codebreaker in mid-air to counter a leaping Fandango, avenging his WrestleMania loss.
The third match of the night was a United States Championship match between reigning champion Kofi Kingston and Dean Ambrose of The Shield. Ambrose made his entrance with the other Shield members, but they left before the match started, leaving Ambrose alone with Kingston. Kofi attempted Trouble in Paradise early in the bout but Ambrose managed to avoid it only for Kofi to come back with a monkey flip. Ambrose struck back with a stiff clothesline and then hit a neckbreaker before connecting with a running front dropkick on Kofi while he was leaned against the ropes. Kingston battled back with multiple kicks and a leaping clothesline but Ambrose caught him and locked him in a crossface chickenwing with body scissors. Kofi fought out and connected with the "Boom Drop" and an "SOS" before Ambrose hit a double underhook suplex from the top rope. Kingston came back yet again, this time with a springboard crossbody, and then he landed the Trouble in Paradise on Ambrose whilst he was on the apron which knocked him out of the ring. Instead of letting him get counted out, Kofi brought Ambrose back into the ring and tried to get the pin but failed when Ambrose kicked out at two. Kingston then tried for the Trouble in Paradise kick again but Ambrose ducked it sending Kingston's leg hurling into the ropes and allowing him to connect with the headlock driver for the win.
The fourth match of the night was a strap match between Mark Henry and Sheamus. The match went back and fourth with both competitors touching three turnbuckles in succession but failing to reach the fourth. The end came when Sheamus struck Henry with a Brogue Kick after reversing a World's Strongest Slam attempt. He then proceeded to touch his final turnbuckle as he had already touched three before Henry attempted his finisher.
The fifth match of the night was an "I Quit" match between Alberto Del Rio and Jack Swagger to determine the #1 contender to the injured Dolph Ziggler's World Heavyweight Championship. Swagger appeared to have won when Zeb Colter threw in Ricardo Rodriguez's towel for Del Rio and referee Mike Chioda mistook it as Rodriguez throwing it, but later reversed the decision upon viewing a video replay, allowing the match to continue. Del Rio would go on to win after locking in the Cross Armbreaker which forced Swagger to quit.
The sixth match of the night was a Tornado tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship between reigning champions Team Hell No and Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins of The Shield. The Shield picked up the victory using an Argentine backbreaker rack and diving leg drop combination on Daniel Bryan, ending Hell No's title reign that had been going on since Night of Champions the past year.
The seventh match of the night was an Extreme Rules match between Big Show and Randy Orton. During the match, Big Show landed a Chokeslam, but Orton kicked out. Orton later landed an RKO, but Show kicked out. He then landed an RKO onto a steel chair, but opted to go for the punt kick instead of pinning him. He successfully landed the punt and pinned Show for the victory.
The eighth match of the night was a Last Man Standing match for the WWE Championship between reigning champion John Cena and Ryback. Both men stood up after huge moves, but the match came to an end when Ryback slammed Cena through the electronically lit wall on the stage, severely injuring him and leaving both down for the 10-count, making the match a no-contest. Despite this, Cena remained the WWE Champion, as championships do not change hands by a no-contest.
The ninth match and main event of the pay-per-view was a Steel Cage match between Brock Lesnar and Triple H. Triple H worked Lesnar's leg for the majority of the match and brought in a sledgehammer that he had hidden on top of the cage, Lesnar nails Triple H and brings him back to the mat. Lesnar grabs the sledgehammer but Triple H ducks. Triple H goes for the Sharpshooter and locks it in. Paul Heyman runs in the cage and Triple H breaks the hold. Triple H nails Heyman with a Pedigree. Triple H decks Lesnar with the sledgehammer and hits a Pedigree on him. Triple H covers for a close 2 count. Triple H grabs the sledgehammer but Heyman hits a low blow from behind and Triple H goes down. Lesnar grabs the sledgehammer and nails Triple H in the jaw with it. Lesnar nails a F5 and covers Triple H for the win.
Aftermath.
The next night on "Raw", Ryback drove into the arena on an ambulance and challenged John Cena for the WWE Championship at Payback in an Ambulance match. On the May 27 episode of "Raw", John Cena challenged Ryback to a 3 Stages of Hell match (with the Ambulance match being the third stage), and Ryback accepted.
Paul Heyman revealed his newest client, Curtis Axel. Triple H challenged Axel to a match, in which he was not medically cleared to compete. He wrestled the match but suffered a concussion, leading to Curtis Axel picking up the victory via KO.
On the May 24, 2013 episode of "SmackDown", Kingston would invoke his rematch clause for the U.S. Championship against Ambrose, but he won via disqualification with Rollins and Reigns interfering. Sheamus and Randy Orton would save Kingston, setting a six man tag team match between The Shield and Orton, Sheamus, and Kingston, but The Shield would emerge victorious. Three days later on "Raw", Kingston would receive another rematch for the title, but Ambrose would defeat Kingston to retain the title.
On the May 27, 2013 episode of "Raw", Team Hell No invoked their rematch clause for the Tag Team Championships, but Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins would defeat them to retain the titles.
Although Dolph Ziggler was absent due to recovering from his concussion suffered from Jack Swagger, Alberto Del Rio would be defeated by Ziggler's bodyguard Big E Langston in a singles match on the next night on "Raw", but Del Rio would defeat him twice two days later on "Main Event" and five days later on "Raw". Four days later on "SmackDown", Langston would defeat Del Rio in a fourth straight singles match, but three days later, Del Rio defeated Langston in their fifth straight singles match. On the June 7 episode of "SmackDown", Ziggler appeared via satellite announcing he would make his return on the June 10 episode of "Raw" and announced that he will defend the title against Del Rio at Payback.

As of April 2013 ownership was transferred from North Lanarkshire Council to CultureNL.
Features.
One of the features at the centre used to include Technopolis where people were allowed to feel part of Lanarkshire's past, by re-creating scenes of eras including heavy industry and steel production. Domestic life of the area is re-created through various talking figures and interactive interpretation. However this part of the Heritage Centre was closed in 2011 and turned over to the storage of paper archives.
There is also a gallery room, located at the ground floor, showing exhibitions provided by North Lanarkshire Council and also exhibitions outwith the local council area. Some international exhibitions are also on display there, and exhibitions are updated regularly.

Wo Gott der Herr nicht bei uns hält, BWV 178

History and words.
Bach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the Eighth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the warning of false prophets from the Sermon on the Mount (). The cantata text is based on the hymn "", published in 1524 by the Lutheran reformer Justus Jonas as a paraphrase of Psalm 124. The theme of the psalm, the need of help against raging enemies, corresponds to the Gospel. Compared to Bach's other chorale cantatas of the period, the unknown poet kept much of the original text, six of the eight stanzas, expanding two of them by recitative, to connect even closer to the Gospel. He paraphrased only stanzas 3 and 6 to an aria each. In the last aria, in a statement of opposition to rationalism—the "weasel words of rationalists, who would bring down the whole Lutheran theological edifice" in the words of John Eliot Gardiner—the poet expands the words of the reformers' hymn, "" (reason cannot grasp it), appealing to reason, described as unstable and frenzied, to be silent.
Bach first performed the cantata on 30 July 1724, as the eighth chorale cantata of his second annual cycle.
Johann Nikolaus Forkel borrowed the manuscripts of Bach's chorale cantatas from Bach's son Friedemann and copied two of the cantatas, "Es ist das Heil uns kommen her", BWV 9, and this cantata.
Scoring and structure.
The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists—alto, tenor and bass—a four-part choir, horn, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola and basso continuo.
Music.
As in most of Bach's chorale cantatas, the opening chorus is a chorale fantasia. The chorale tune was published in 1529 by an anonymous author in Wittenberg. The soprano sings this chorale melody line by line, doubled by the horn, as a cantus firmus to the independent concerto of the orchestra. The strings play "agitated dotted rhythms", the oboes "agitated semiquaver cascades" throughout the movement, supplying a sense of unity. The lower voices sing partly in homophony, partly in independent movement similar to the instruments. Bach uses the contrast to illustrate the text in the first lines, with no regard to its negation. "" is set in homophony and the last word "" (literally: "holds") is held as a long note, whereas in "" the raging of the enemies is shown in dotted rhythm and fast runs. When the bar form's is repeated in the following lines, Bach repeats the music also, although it doesn't reflect the text.
In the following chorale and recitative, Bach distinguishes the chorale lines from the secco recitative by a continuo line on a repeated motif that is derived from the beginning of the respective melody line, termed "in rhythmically compressed form ... four times as fast".
The first aria shows the image of "wild sea surf" in undulating movements in the voice, in the obbligato part of the violins in unison, and in the continuo. The bass voice has to sing challenging coloraturas on the words "" and especially "" (be wrecked).
The center of the cantata is an unchanged stanza of the chorale, the alto's unadorned melody accompanied by the oboes d'amore and the continuo as equal partners.
In movement 5, Bach differentiates chorale and recitative differently from movement 2. The chorale lines are four-part settings, the recitatives are given to individual different singers in the sequence bass, tenor, alto, bass. The continuo unifies the movement by a constant independent regular motion in motifs based on triads.
In the last aria Bach invents a setting for strings that illustrates the instability of "frenzied reason" in syncopated rhythm, interrupted by chords on the repeated appeal "" (be silent). The drama of the aria rests only at the end of the middle section, when the words "" (they will be revived with solace) are given by a fermata and the marking adagio. The cantata is closed by two stanzas of the chorale in a four-part setting.

The Barry Building

The Barry Building is a landmarked mid-20th century modern commercial building located at 11973 San Vicente Boulevard in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, designed by architect Milton Caughey in 1950. It was identified by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission as being a well-preserved and notable example of the California-style modern design and was landmarked (Historical Cultural Monument #887) by the city of Los Angeles in 2007.
Design and History.
The Barry Building was commissioned by David Barry and completed in 1951, one of Milton Caughey's few commercial buildings. Caughey was an early adopter of the use of indoor and outdoor space that is now associated with mid-20th century modern architecture in Southern California. The building features a set of outdoor cantilevered stairs which curve down to a central, two-story courtyard. The flat roof and simple style are emblematic of Caughey's work, which was influenced by Corbusier and the International Style. The building housed the Dutton’s Bookstore for more than two decades before it closed in 2008. It is now home to the Caffe Luxxe.

Scăieni Phalanstery

Scăieni Phalanstery (Romanian: "Falansterul de la Scăieni") was a utopic experimental community (phalanstery) created in 1835-1836 by Romanian boyar Teodor Diamant in the town of Scăieni, Prahova County, Wallachia (today part of Boldești-Scăeni Commune) based on the ideas of the French socialist Charles Fourier. The experiment was forcefully closed down by the authorities.
Origins.
Before the 1848 Revolutions, Teodor Diamant, a member of the lower nobility, together with other Wallachian intellectuals learnt about the ideas of Charles Fourier, an early French utopian socialist, during Diamant's studies in Paris in the 1830s.
He presented his social and economic views in three articles that were published in June 1834 in Ion Heliade Rădulescu's "Curierul Românesc" magazine.
Foundation.
In 1835, a year after Diamant returned to Wallachia, he established a phalanstery (an agricultural-industrial community based on Fourier's principles) at the estate in Scăieni owned by boyar Emanoil Bălăceanu. The estate, ridden with debts, had already been put under sequester and the ongoing debt problem prevented the society from acquiring better equipment.
The first attestation of the society was on March 10, 1835, when Bălăceanu leased the estate to the society, the date being mentioned by Bălăceanu as the start of the phalanstery. The preparations took the rest of the year 1836 and the society began functioning in early 1836.
The community.
The earliest members of the phalanstery were Roma people liberated from slavery by the boyar, but the first recruits moved to Scăieni in January 1836. Another group of ten young people who joined the phalanstery on August 18, 1836.
It produced both agricultural and handicraft goods, the workday was of only 8 hours, at a time when many peasants worked up to 14–16 hours a day, however there were no days of rest. The produce of the commune was distributed according to the amount of work performed and the level of skill, assessed through vote by the members of the community and according to the quantity of capital contributed.
Ending.
The community came into the eyes of the authorities in August 1836 and one of their representatives visited the phalanstery in Scăieni. The report discusses a group of 24 people, wearing odd clothing and who were not very willing to talk about their community. The fact that so many men and women lived in a common household made the authorities presume that it was a brothel. The authorities desired a more thoroughly visit to the community, but Bălăceanu refused.
The Phalanstery was terminated in 1836 by the authorities which feared that this kind of experiments would encourage communist beliefs in the country, although the official reason was that the community was not registered properly with the authorities.
Although the era's documents say that there was no violence at the disbanding of the phalanstery, some romanticized accounts talk about an exile of the founders (according to Ion Ghica) or clashes between the phalanstery members and the authorities (according to Ştefan Greceanu). Nevertheless, Emanoil Bălăceanu was arrested at the order of Hospodar Alexandru Ghica, but it seems that the reason was that he refused to change the name of the Agricultural and Manufactural Society, which sounded too similar to an Agricultural Society of the Hospodar. Another reason was the insolence of asking the Hospodar in a petition dated November 1, 1836 for a modern plough.
Following the disbanding of the phalanstery, 14 of the former members of the phalanstery filed a complaint at the judicial divan against Manolache Bălăceanu, accusing him of breach of contract and requesting back the money invested, complaining about the living conditions in the phalanstery.
After that, Teodor Diamant continued envisioning the creation of new phalansteries ("agricultural-industrial colonies") for the newly liberated slaves in Moldavia in 1841, for this purpose preparing a memorandum to the Administrative Consul of Moldavia, but this was not accepted.
Legacy.
Being the earliest socialist movement in Romania, during the rule of the Communist Party in Romania, the authorities promoted Diamant as a visionary. In 1958, his work, "Scrieri economice" (Economic Writings) was posthumously published at Editura Științifică and in 1979 a movie called "Falansterul", inspired from the Scăieni Phalanstery, was released.

Sumner Dam

Sumner Dam is a dam on the Pecos River in De Baca County in eastern New Mexico.
The dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1935 and 1939, a project governed by the Bureau in conjunction with the local Carlsbad Irrigation District. Construction was done by the Bureau with the help of workers of the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps; some remnants of their artistic rockwork are the five rock bridges on the main road on the east side of the lake.
The dam is 164 feet tall and impounds the Pecos with a total capacity of about 43,800 acre-feet. The resulting reservoir, Lake Sumner, is the location of the community of Lake Sumner, New Mexico, and of Sumner Lake State Park. The state park was established in 1966 on a 50-year lease from the Bureau of Reclamation (expiring in 2016), and originally called Alamogordo Lake State Park. The lake was completely drained for irrigation needs in 2001, destroying fish stocks, but recreational use has since rebounded. The state park is unusual in providing public access to the riparian area below the dam.
