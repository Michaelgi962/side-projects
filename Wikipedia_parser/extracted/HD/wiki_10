Kataegis

In molecular biology kataegis describes a pattern of localized hypermutation identified in some cancer genomes. The term "kataegis" is derived from the ancient Greek word for "thunder", καταιγίς ("kataigis"). Regions of kataegis have been shown to be colocalised with regions of somatic genome rearrangements. The base mutations in these regions were found to be almost exclusively cytosine to thymine in the context of a TpC dinucleotide. It has been hypothesised that an enzyme of the APOBEC family is responsible for the process of kataegis. The direct link between the APOBEC deaminases and kataegistic clusters of mutations was recently obtained by expressing hyperactive deaminase in yeast cells.

Nico Santucci, born (Nicholas Joseph Santucci) 1962 in Chicago, Illinois is an Italian-American restaurateur, entrepreneur and designer. Santucci is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Black Door Global, a Los Angeles based, real estate development and lifestyle company and Elite Management Services which includes restaurant, nightlife, and commercial food processing and real estate divisions. Santucci is also a philanthropist, having raised funds for Safenest a Las Vegas charity helping abused women and children.
Biography.
Early life.
Santucci's Italian-American family immigrated to the United States from Abruzzo, Italy. Nico was raised in Chicago, Illinois. Nico attended High School in Chicago and later moved to Los Angeles.
His first entrepreneurial venture was as a teen, when he purchased a fleet of 40 decommissioned taxicabs for $100 a piece from Yellow Cab of Chicago, Illinois, and repaired and painted them to working condition and then sold them for $1,500, making a small fortune for a young teen. Nico then entered the world of real estate by diversifying his assets into real estate holdings, beginning with the Parisian Palace, a mansion that Nico designed not only as a home, but as a venue for parties and events. Nico also built and designed the rock star themed ultra lounge Black Door, Venus and C2K at the Venetian Hotel and Casino. Cafe Moda and Lynx lounge were two other properties that Nico built and owned. Nico is constantly developing and designing commercial properties in Las Vegas and now in Los Angeles.
Restaurants.
Nico Santucci has secured and maintained two Italian restaurants in Las Vegas, Nevada called Capo's Italian Restaurants. Capo's is a trademarked Speakeasy mob-themed restaurant and bar. One source refers to Santucci as the head chef and owner 
Had another wonderful meal at Capos in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is old mob style; the hosts play up the part. The seating area is that tufted blood red Old Italian circular booths… always have your back to the wall type. It is so dark that you have to use a little flash light to see the menu. But come for the food! The Risotto is creamy, buttery and smooth. The veal picotta has bold lemony flavors, but is balanced and tender. This restaurant is top on the to do list when we travel to Las Vegas. We have recommended many friends who have had the same shared experience. Forgot the cookie cutter "Celebrity Chef" places on the strip, and take a trip into the center of town. Be prepared, you may have to give you cabbie directions.
Limousine Company.
Upon moving to Los Angeles, Nico started The Elite Limousine company, originally with 1 car and growing to 14 Limo's within 2 years. He later sold the company to a Japanese corporation, and made enough to retire.
Los Angeles Real Estate.
After Nico's success in the Limo business, he decided to invest in real estate, where he bought, designed and renovated mansions. Nico remodeled 11 mansions in Los Angeles, including Mansion 11, Penthouse 28.
Las Vegas Real Estate.
Nico purchased, designed and sold the Red Rock Mansion in Las Vegas. He then purchased a 14,000 square foot majestic French castle on Palmyra road in 2004, redesigned the castle to resemble a 17th-century Versailles palace which later became known as the world famous Parisian palace with 21 rooms. Nico also added another 5,000 square feet to the property. Nico also designed the Sultan Lounge, Lynx Lounge, Zen Mansion, Capo's Tropicana, Moulin Rouge, Capo's Sahara as well as a partnership with Dave Navarro for the Black Door Bar and Grill.
Food Manufacture.
Nico Santucci and his Elite Management Services acquired on October 20, 2011 the "Capone Family Secret" trademark and company located in Cicero, IL, from Dominic Capone (grandnephew of Al Capone) and Trademark Trustee Desiree Alonzo. Capo's Capone Family Secret from his families secret recipes were made into a line of Italian canned and bottled home food products.

Planeat

Planeat is a 2010 British documentary film by Or Shlomi and Shelley Lee Davies. The film discusses the possible nutritional and environmental benefits of adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet based on the research of T. Colin Campbell, Caldwell Esselstyn and Gidon Eshel. The film also features the views of Peter Singer.
According to Shelley Lee Davies, the film purposely does not cover any purported animal welfare arguments for adopting a plant-based (vegan) diet, but concentrates on the health and environmental reasons instead.
"Planeat" premiered at the 2010 Newport Beach Film Festival. It released theatrically in the United States in April 2011 and the United Kingdom in May 2011. The film was privately screened by the film's directors and Willie Bain MP at Somerset House in March 2011 and in the House of Commons in May 2011.
Critical reception.
Jamie Russell of "Total Film" called it "Forceful stuff, though we can take or leave the kale sandwiches."
Cath Clarke of "The Guardian" gave the movie 2 stars out of 5 and, speaking as a vegetarian convert, speculated on her reasons for disliking the film: "Maybe it's the tippy-toe, softly-softly tone, sprinkling inspiration between the science, with visits to boutique organic farms and kooky vegan cupcake bakeries. Possibly it ought to come with a warning: contains traces of smugness.
Charlotte O'Sullivan of the "London Evening Standard" writes, ""PlanEat" is on a serious mission but its lack of focus is infectious. My big question as the credits rolled: why are so many vegan chefs covered in tattoos?"
Christopher Long of "Movie Metropolis" gave the movie a 5 out of 10 saying, "a movie by true believers for true believers, and I am not one."

Ancient Light

Ancient Light is a 2012 novel by Irish writer John Banville. First published on 7 July 2012, the novel concludes a trilogy concerning Alexander Cleave and his daughter, Cass. "Ancient Light" was preceded by "Shroud" and "Eclipse".
Plot and themes.
"Ancient Light" is narrated by Alexander Cleave, a 60-something year-old retired actor, and takes place 10 years after the death of his daughter Cass in "Eclipse". Cleave begins to record his memories of a first, unlikely affair he had at age 15 with Mrs Gray, a married woman 20 years his senior. "Billy Gray was my best friend and I fell in love with his mother." The book moves between memories of this affair and his current state of grief he shares with his wife Lydia, touching on themes of family, love, grief, and the reliability of memory. His solitude is interrupted by an offer to play the lead in a film entitled "The Invention of the Past". The film is to be based on the life of literary theorist Axel Vander, the man with Cass when she killed herself in Italy. On the set Cleave bonds with Dawn Devonport, an emotionally fragile young ingenue mourning the death of her father. As Cleave continues to narrate his past relationship with Mrs Gray to its inevitable conclusion, the father-daughter relationship grows between him and Dawn.
Reception.
Critical reception for "Ancient Light" has been mostly positive, with a reviewer for the "The Independent" calling it a "luminous, breathtaking work." Critics for "The Guardian" also reviewed "Ancient Light", with Tim Adams praising Banville's themes and "cleverness" while Alex Clark wrote that the dual narrative was "disorienting". "The Telegraph" gave the book three out of five stars, writing that it is "notably, though for the most part seamlessly, light-fingered – strings of Yeses from Ulysses, bits of Eliot, a hazel wood from Yeats, a lovely quote from Leopardi". The Harvard Crimson panned the novel, saying that "he major weakness of “Ancient Light,” however, lies is not in its moments of gimmickry but in its vagueness".
"Ancient Light" won the Irish Book Awards in the Novel category (2012). Colm Tóibín named it one of his books of the year.

Eastern Bank Ltd (historic)

The Eastern Bank Limited, was a British bank founded in 1909 in London, to help finance trade with Far east. In 1957 Chartered Bank (now Standard Chartered Bank), acquired Eastern, and eventually absorbed it into Standard Chartered in 1971.
History.
Early years : 1909 - 1945.
Eastern Bank Limited was founded in 1909 in London, as a new Eastern exchange bank, to help finance trade with the far east. The next year Eastern established branches in Bombay and Calcutta. Right from its inception, the bank had a number of powerful institutional shareholders, including the Sassoon family.
Eastern expanded into the Ottoman province of Mesopotamia (now Iraq), opening a Baghdad branch in 1912. The province had promises of a lucrative oil exploration concession, being actively pursued by a consortium which included Anglo-Persian Oil Company (now BP), Royal Dutch Shell, and Deutsche Bank named - Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC), now Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC). Eastern Bank had to close its Baghdad branch at the start of the World War I due to the alliance from the Ottoman Empire and German Empire, and competition from other banks that included Deutsche Bank and The National Bank of Turkey. However, Eastern reopened its Baghdad branch within a year and opened branches in Basra (1915), and Amarah (1916), in the wake of the British invasion of Iraq. With the establishment of a British Mandate over Iraq, the bank expanded further into Mosul (1919) and Kirkuk (1926). 
Eastern also expanded to other British possessions East of Suez, namely Colombo, Ceylon (1920), Madras (1922), Karachi (1923), and Singapore (1928). British banks also expanded into the small sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf, British protectorates which were short of modern financial institutions. Eastern opened a branch in Bahrain in 1920 to leverage the close trading links between the island and Bombay, a key stronghold of Eastern bank. Until 1944, Eastern remained the island's only bank. By the late 1930s, profits rose because of the booming oil industry in the Arab sheikhdoms. However, Eastern couldn't expand further in the region as the Imperial Bank of Persia (later the British Bank of the Middle East) held near monopoly agreements during the 1940s with the rulers of several important sheikhdoms, especially Kuwait. 
During the 1930s and 1940s, Barclays Bank (DCO) started acquiring stake in Eastern Bank and in 1939 the chairman of Barclays (DCO) joined the board of Eastern Bank.
Post world war: 1945 - 1957.
After the Second World War, Eastern opened branches in Penang, (Malaysia) (1947, closed 1958), with a sub-branch at Butterworth (1948, closed 1957), Kuala Lumpur (1948), Chittagong, (East Pakistan, now Bangladesh) (1948, closed 1958), and Cochin, (India) (1953, closed 1958). It also opened branches at Doha, (Qatar) (1950), Aden, (Yemen) (1951), with a sub-branch at Steamer Point (1953, closed 1958), Mukalla, (Yemen) (1955), and Beirut, (Syria) (1956).
Barclays Bank DCO increased its stake as a strategic initiative to tap into its Arab customers via Eastern Bank, as Barclays had a strong Jewish customer base in Palestine. By 1957, Barclays Bank DCO and the Sassoon family in total held a controlling 65% of the capital of the bank.
Amalgamation into Standard Chartered: 1957 - 1971.
In 1957, the Mundhra Scandal inflicted heavy losses on Eastern Bank's Bombay and Calcutta branches. The same year, Barclays DCO and the Sassoon family sold their controlling interest in the bank to Chartered Bank, an Eastern Bank rival. At that time, Chartered bank faced the challenges of a post colonial world with new national government policies in China, India, Burma and Ceylon, and saw Eastern bank as a strategic acquisition. The bank remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Chartered Bank, with some level of autonomy. 
The political changes in several Arab countries during the 1960s led to nationalisation of branches in Iraq, Aden, Mukalla, and Sheikh Othman, and these events greatly affected Eastern. During the same time, it opened branches in Sharjah (1958), Abu Dhabi (1961), Al Ain (Buraimi, Abu Dhabi) (1962), Seiyun (Yemen) (1962), and Bowbazar in Calcutta (1969).
In 1969, Chartered Bank merged with the South African bank Standard Bank, forming Standard Chartered Bank. In 1971, Standard Chartered absorbed Eastern's operations, and the name "Eastern Bank Ltd" slowly disappeared.

Geonkhali is a village and scenic tourist spot in the Mahisadal Block of East Midnapore district of West Bengal. It is located 130 km to the south of Kolkata at the confluence of the rivers Hooghly, Rupnarayan and Damodar. At the confluence, the river is so wide as to resemble the sea, making for a spectacular sight. Geonkhali is connected to Gadiara and Nurpur by regular launch services. 
Geonkhali houses several water treatment plants that supply fresh water to Haldia where the water is saline. Besides the rivers, tourist attractions in the area include the Mahisadal palace, the Radha Krishna temple at Mahisadal and the nearby town of Kolaghat. 
Geonkhali lies at the head of the 623-km long NW 5 that includes the Hijli Tidal Canal and the East Coast Canal linking it to Orissa's Paradip and Dhamra ports and the Matai, Brahmani and Mahanadi rivers. A proposed 2,200-crore shipyard project by the Apeejay and Bharti groups at Geonkhali was abandoned in the aftermath of the Singur and Nandigram incidents following opposition by local residents to acquisition of their lands.

The Rubber Room

The Rubber Room is a 2010 documentary film about the reassignment centers run by the New York City Department of Education, which the filmmakers claim exist in various forms in school districts across the United States. Allegedly intended to serve as temporary holding facilities for teachers accused of various kinds of misconduct who are awaiting an official hearing, these reassignment centers have become known amongst the "exiled" teachers subculture as "rubber rooms", so named after the padded cells of psychiatric hospitals.
Film content.
The film documents the daily routines of teachers accused of misconduct or incompetence. Several days, weeks, months, or even years are spent in these "Kafkaesque" rubber rooms waiting for some kind of resolution; the filmmakers estimate that the average wait time is three years, but cited cases lasting as long as ten years. During this time in "exile", the teachers receive their full pay and benefit packages at the cost of up to 65 million dollars per year to the city, spending each day reading, playing cards, balancing checkbooks, sleeping, or simply staring blankly at the walls. Interviewed teachers from the rubber room describe the high tensions that develop between teachers angry at their inexplicable situations that curiously lead to a "prison-like" environment in which teachers largely separate themselves into fiercely territorial cliques, sometimes even resulting in physical altercations.
The rubber room is shown as a way that administrators are able to be rid of teachers by circumventing the notoriously difficult process of removing a tenured teacher. Reasons that teachers are sent to the rubber room range from accusations as extreme as physical and sexual abuse of students to as minor as excessive tardiness or even simple personality conflicts with administrators, and yet these groups of teachers are shown to be lumped together in the same situation with egregiously delayed hearings, often without evidence of any misconduct, sometimes even going without knowledge of what the alleged misconduct actually is, for up to three years.
Furthermore, the film shows some students boasting about having learned to take advantage of this system after realizing that they have the power to remove teachers almost at will. This upset in the balance of power, they show, can have drastic effects on the teachers' ability to do their jobs and effectively teach while maintaining order in the classrooms.
Making of the film.
In an interview with MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, filmmaker and former New York City teacher Jeremy Garrett explained that they intended their film to be an exposé on not only the excessive waste that is associated with maintaining the rubber rooms, but also to highlight the "shifting landscape in education", modern students' lack of respect for teachers and how it affects their ability to teach, and mismanagement of the educational system in general. 
During production, Mr Garrett was arrested for trespassing while covertly filming the events of daily life inside the rubber room. According to Garrett, the arrest came after the Department of Education learned of his intent to collect footage inside the rubber rooms for the exposé.
The film was profiled in a 2008 segment of "This American Life" with Ira Glass called "Human Resources", which related various human resources problems in the country. 
In 2010, another documentary about the failures of the American public education, "Waiting for "Superman"", licensed footage shot by Five Boroughs Productions for "The Rubber Room" to use in "Waiting for "Superman's" short segment on the reassignment centers.
Release and reception.
On April 12, 2010, the New York Department of Education (DoE) announced that it would be closing down its reassignment centers, facing pressures from the public and the teachers' union. He was accused of doing nothing. 
Due in part to media attention on the subject including the release of "Waiting for "Superman"" earlier in the year, as well as the recent settlement between the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and DoE, the film was released to three full audiences on April 16, 2010, with largely positive reactions from the audience and critics in attendance.

Archibald Fullarton

Archibald Fullarton and Co. was a prominent publisher in Glasgow in the 1800s, and maintained a prodigious output of books, atlases and maps. The company produced the last maps to boast decorative vignettes, often done by George Heriot Swanston, the Scottish cartographer and engraver. Fullarton was in partnership with John Blackie in Glasgow until 1831, when the stock, plant and agencies were equally shared out.
“"Fullarton’s Parliamentary Gazetteer of England and Wales"”, was a set of finely engraved maps of the counties, recording the changes brought about by the Great Reform Bill, which was the basis of Britain’s modern parliamentary constituencies, and went through a large numbers of editions. Some maps were engraved by Robert Scott, who made use of vignette views to decorate the map border. Another monumental work by the firm was the “"Royal Illustrated Atlas"”
James Bell (1769-1836) published his ""New and Comprehensive Gazetteer of England and Wales"" in 1833-4. Bell was a writer on geography who edited Rollin's ""Ancient History"" in 1828 and wrote a ""System of Geography"" in 1830. The maps in his gazetteer all bear the imprint of the publisher and were engraved by Gray and Son, Josiah Neele & Co or Robert Scott.
Fullarton republished extracts from Bell's "Gazetteer" in his Parliamentary Gazetteer, acknowledging that some material had been included. He was therefore angry at what he saw as an accusation of plagiarism and 'extremely disingenuous attempt to underrate the value and importance of their laborious and accurate Compilation' stating that 'these materials do not constitute one third part of the present Publication'. 
Curiously, James Bell had pirated the work of Samuel Lewis' ""Topographical Dictionary"". Lewis obtained an injunction in 1839 and Bell's Gazetteer was withdrawn. Fullarton, who had been Bell's publisher, bought the plates, and issued the maps in his own Parliamentary Gazetteer.
Fullarton was also responsible for Rev. J. M. Wilson's ""Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland"", its companion volume ""Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales"" and Bartholomew's ""Imperial Map"".
On 20 November 1809 Fullarton, William Sommerville and John Blackie entered into a partnership, taking over the business of publisher A. & W. D. Brownlie, where they had previously worked. Archibald Fullarton was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 18 December 1815, as he had earlier married Jean, the daughter of John M'Naught, a weaver, who had served in the Glasgow Regiment.

WTCF

WTCF (103.3 FM) is an American broadcast radio station licensed to serve the community of Wardensville, West Virginia. WTCF carries a Southern Gospel music format, serving the Northern Shenandoah Valley and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.
WTCF is owned and operated by Timber Ridge Ministries, Inc., with a sale pending to Educational Media Foundation.
Pre-broadcast history.
On May 23, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced Alex Media, Inc. as high bidder and winner of the auction for the 103.3 FM frequency to be located in Wardensville, West Virginia, part of Auction 91. Alex Media filed a construction permit on August 17, 2011, for a radio station to broadcast on that frequency and transmit from Little North Mountain in western Frederick County, Virginia.
A potential problem between the new station and existing station WLTK, which was also broadcasting on 103.3, was corrected after Alex Media asked the FCC to file a "Show Cause" notice asking WLTK to move to vacant frequency 102.9 FM. On November 7, 2011, WLTK filed to move from 103.3 FM to 102.9 FM, allowing Alex Media to begin broadcasting on 103.3 FM without interference. On June 15, 2012, the owners of WLTK applied for and were granted a new broadcast license moving it from 103.3 to 102.9, but from the same location and tower, at the same power and over the same coverage area as previously. On June 19, 2012, WLTK officially switched frequencies from 103.3 to 102.9 MHz.
The call sign WTCF was awarded on March 19, 2012, and on June 21, 2012, it was announced on "The Cross FM", a web-only radio station broadcasting from WTRM's studios in Winchester, Virginia, that it would launch on WTCF in "45 to 60 days".
On June 25, 2012, Alex Media entered into an Option Agreement to sell WTCF to WTRM owners Timber Ridge Ministries, Inc. for $650,000. A time brokerage agreement was also entered on the same date. On the same day, Alex Media applied for a construction permit to move to another tower, from the authorized tower, with an increase in power, from 340 watts to 350 watts. One day later on July 26, 2012, the station announced via their official Facebook page, that they would be launching on September 4, 2012, but will be in "testing mode" during the month of August. At 10:00am, on August 15, 2012, WTCF began operations in "testing mode".
On August 28, 2012, Alex Media filed an "Application for Construction Permit for Commercial Broadcast Station" for WTCF in advance of the station's September 4 launch. It would not be until one month later, on September 28, that WTCF would apply for and be granted an FM broadcast license. WTCF ended their "testing mode" programming and officially launched on September 4, 2012 at 9:00 am.
Though the station is licensed to Wardensville, the WTCF's studios are located along Valley Avenue in Winchester, Virginia, in the same building as former sister station WTRM.
Sale of WTRM.
On February 6, 2013, Timber Ridge Ministries sold then-sister station WTRM to the American Family Association for $1.1 million. The sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 28, 2013 and was closed on April 11, 2013. At 8:30 pm on April 11, 2013, WTRM officially switched to American Family Radio programming with "Southern Light" programming remaining online on a Timber Ridge Ministries owned website.
WTCF was not part of the sale and programming on WTCF was not affected.
Sale of WTCF.
Alex Media, Inc. filed an Asset Purchase Agreement with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on July 5, 2013, beginning the process of selling WTCF to Timber Ridge Ministries for $650,000. Alex Media had previously entered into an Option Agreement to sell WTCF to Timber Ridge Ministries for $650,000 back on June 25, 2012. An application to assign the WTCF license to Timber Ridge Ministries was filed on August 26, 2013, and was consummated on September 1, 2013.
Format Flip.
WTCF signed off its hybrid Contemporary Christian/Christian Rock/Christian Hip Hop after just 18 months on the air, switching to Southern Gospel as "Southern Light" at 12Noon on March 27, 2014. The "Southern Light" format was previously heard on former sister-station WTRM.
Sold Again.
On May 19, 2014, Educational Media Foundation (EMF) purchased WTCF, from owner Timber Ridge Ministries, for $425,000. Timber Ridge sold the station for $175,000 less than what they purchased it for in 2013. In its filing with the FCC, EMF announced plans to make WTCF an affiliate of their K-LOVE network.

Tennis records of the Open Era – Men's Singles

The Open Era in tennis began in April 1968, when the Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs. A professional tennis tour was created for the entire year, where everyone could compete in. This meant that the division that had existed for many years between these two groups had finally come to an end, which made the tennis world into one unified competition. 
The first event to go "open" started on April 22, 1968 at The West Hants Club in Bournemouth, England, while the first Grand Slam tournament to do so was the 1968 French Open (Roland Garros) starting May 27.
Records and titles from before this date are difficult to compare with those of the Open Era, since many of the best players were not allowed to participate in the respective tournaments.
For a complete list of all time records (1877–present) see the article Tennis records of All Time - Men's Singles.

Serenade (Stravinsky)

Serenade in A is a composition for solo piano by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was completed on September 9, 1925, in Vienna, and published by Boosey & Hawkes This work was composed as a result of his signing his first recording contract for Brunswick, so Stravinsky wrote the piece in a way that each movement would fit on one side of a 78 rpm gramophone record. It was dedicated to his wife.
Structure.
This compositions consists of four movements and should take 12 minutes to perform. The movement list is as follows:
Even though the work is titled "Serenade in A", it is not actually in the key of A major nor in A minor. According to Eric White, A is not the "key" of the work, but rather the music radiates from and tends towards A as a "tonic pole". Thus, the first and the last chord of each movement contains the note A, either as the root, third, or fifth of a triad. According to Stravinsky, the piece was conceived "in imitation of the "" of the eighteenth century, which was usually commissioned by patron princes for various festive occasions, and included, as did the suites, an indeterminate number of pieces". Therefore, the movement titles are meant to evoke the specific parts of such festive celebration.
From the pianist's perspective this movement is also related to Frédéric Chopin's Ballade No. 2 in F major, while the "" reflects Stravinsky's Russian heritage.

They typically see their actions through a narcissistic lens as being morally justified in revenge against their unfair treatment by an uncaring world, and wish to "go out in a blaze of glory".
Some observers have divided mass killers into three categories: pseudocommandos, family annihilators, and hit-and-run killers.

Una Guðmundsdóttir

__NOTOC__
Una Guðmundsdóttir (18 November 1894 – 4 October 1978), known as Una í Garði (Una in Garður) and Una of Sjólyst, was an Icelandic educator and psychic.
Una Guðmundsdóttir was born in the schoolhouse in the town of Garður on 18 November 1894, the youngest of seven children of Guðmundur Jónsson and Guðríður Þórðardóttir. Her mother died in January 1895, when Una was about 8 weeks old. Una's father was drowned in March 1899, when Una was 4; she and her siblings were raised by Sigurlaug Sveinbjarnardóttir, and Una remained with her until her death in 1927 at the age of 82. In 1927, Una adopted Stefanía Guðríður Kristvinsdóttir (born 26 June 1927), who died suddenly on 10 August 1953, at the age of 27. Una said that Stefanía's death was the most difficult part of her life.
Educational work.
Una began teaching children when she was 16. At that time the minimum age for school in Iceland was 10 years. For decades, Una ran one of the first primary schools in the country, "barnastúka Siðsemd nr. 14", as headmistress from 26 October 1934 to 11 December 1954, and after that as deputy head for another 12 years. She also taught older children who had trouble learning. The small house near the harbour in Garður where she lived became known as Sjólyst and she was often identified as 'Una of Sjólyst', although that was originally the name of a neighbouring house which has since been demolished. Because of her teaching, the house was also referred to as "the schoolhouse", and for a while the local library was housed there. She was also important in the local temperance movement and in producing plays.
Psychic activities.
At an early age Una became aware that she had psychic talents. She was said to have "connections with the otherworld" and became known as "the völva of Suðurnes", which was the title of a 1969 book by Gunnar M. Magnúss focussing on one of her experiences, which sold out in three weeks and made her nationally known; the book was reissued in 1979. Many people consulted her for advice. She had a reputation as a healer, once greatly helping a reporter with his bad back, and children brought injured birds to her to be nursed back to health.
Legacy.
Una's house was to have been demolished like those near it, but was bought and preserved. In November 2011 a group was formed to honour her memory, and they are restoring the house to turn it into a museum.
, Guðmundur Magnússon was also working on a documentary about her.

Juma Mosque of Nakhchivan

Juma Mosque of Nakhchivan or Friday Mosque of Nakhchivan () – is one of monumental constructions of the Atabegs’ Architectural Complex in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. The architectural monument demolished in the 20th century is documented in images and photos from the 19th century. 
Like the Marand and Urmia mosques, there were two lancet arches in walls of the Friday Mosque in Nakhchivan, although the southern wall of its cubic trunk was covered with a cupola. This shows that a new local type of mosque was created and developed in the center of Azerbaijan in the 12th century. According to photo documents all three sides of the masqura of the mosque were surrounded with columns. But there is no information about their appearance. According to V.A.Engelguard: 
It can therefore be considered that the arch with two minarets is connected to the Friday mosque with cells and a columned gallery and it is opened to the yard of the mosque. From historical sources it is known that there was a madrasa in the Atabegs’ Architectural complex. There is no doubt that this madrasa had a direct connection with Friday mosque. It is considered that the arch with two-minarets was the arch of the yard where are collected religious constructions of the Atabegs’ complex.
If the first constructions of the Atabegs’ Complex were the palace and divan, then the last construction was the arch which has been documented only in photos. The scientist of oriental studies N.Khanikov saw this arch in the 19th century and from a ligature located on its door read that "It was ordered to construct the mosque in 1187, by amir Nureddin – leader of the cavalry and tax collector of the Atabeys’ state of Azerbaijan". That ligature was finished with "Ajami Nakhchivani’s work" words. The great entrance arch was surrounded with short and tall arches and there were minarets with cylindrical trunks at the edges of proportional formed arch covered with ligature boom. This monument of Nakhchivan which has one of the first arches in such a shape, is evidence of the highest level achieved by the Azerbaijani religious architecture of the mid-11th and 12th centuries. Such a composition of the arch became the main architectural method in a lot of Islamic countries in the next centuries.

Frankfurt American High School

Frankfurt American High School (FAHS) was a Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) system school located on what was once known as the Abrams Complex in Frankfurt Germany. One of DoDDS original six high schools in Germany, the school served the children of American military, government and civilian personnel from 1946 until its closing in 1995. Originally known as the "Maroon Raiders", the "Eagle" was adopted as the school's mascot during the 1948-49 school year. The school's colors are black and gold. The motto is "Eagles Über Alles."
History.
The Frankfurt Community High School building, originally housing the Friedrich Ebert Reform School was constructed in 1929-30. Designed by Ernst May, Frankfurt city architect, the building was the first of its kind in Europe and drew visitors from all parts of Europe and America. The original school opened on 22 September 1930, enrolling children from 6 to 14 years of age.
In 1933 the Hitler regime renamed the school the Dietrich Eckart Schule. It was then used until 1939 as a German youth school. In 1939 the entire building was remodeled. The main portion was used as a German military hospital called Lazarett zum Heiligen Geist. The three wings were used as an officer's school by the German army. In 1944 the building was used for storing furniture of residents in and about Frankfurt who had been "bombed out" by the Allies. It was also used to house many homeless people. From May 1945 to September 1946 the building was used as billets for American troops, primarily Engineers and Signal battalions.
On 2 September 1946 the building at, Am Bornheimer Hang 46, was vacated in order to be used as the Community High School. The new school opened with 185 students and had 24 graduates in the class of 1947. During the '46 - '47 school year, 7th and 8th graders attended the school. Frankfurt, along with Berlin, Bremen (Bremerhaven), Heidelberg, Munich and Erlangen(Nurnberg), where the first American high schools to open in the European Theater between September and October 1946.
Originally called the Frankfurt Community High School, in 1951 it was known as Frankfurt High School. In 1961 the name again changed to Frankfurt American High School.

In the fall of 1954, the school moved to a newly constructed set of buildings on Sioli Straβe at Miquel Allee, near the I.G. Farben building. The new school complex included new male and female dormitories.
Freshmen attended the school from 1946 until 1959 and again from 1988 until 1995.
Dormitory life.
A dormitory was located near the school to house students whose families lived too far away to commute daily.
Dormitory students (Dormies) included those residing only during the school week, 5 days, and those who lived so far away that they only went home on long holidays. The 7 day students included those living as far away as Moscow and Kabul. Two students were assigned to each room. Generally, the underclassmen were housed on the bottom floor while upperclassmen occupied the upper floor. The girls' dorm was separated from the boys' dorm by a social lounge connecting the two. Occasionally, social events such as dance classes took place in this area.
Dorm life was very structured and included a mandatory 2 hour study period each night. During the study periods, students were required to be seated at their desks, in the rooms, with the door open. The door was left open so that the adult monitors could see that each student was present and a minimum of distraction was adhered to. At the beginning of Study Hall the building was locked down and everyone was in for the night (with a few exceptions). After Study Hall there was a short period of time for night grooming, a short snack, and such, until lights out.
Military communities served.
And students from Bonn, where the U.S. Embassy was located.
Closing.
With the redeployment of US forces in response to the Gulf War and closing of bases in the Frankfurt region following the Cold War and German reunification, the school closed following the 1994-95 school year. The Abrams Complex was returned to the German Federal government and the school was transferred to the Philip Holzman Schule.

Simo (society)

The Simo society is a secret society in West Africa (esp. Ghana, Mali, Sierra Leone) also described as a "masked cult". It hails, according to a UNESCO report, from among either the Temne people or the Baga people at the time of the Mali Empire. The Susu people's political organization "assigned an important role to the Simo initiation society", and it "dominated" the organization of the Baga and the Landuma people. Initiation and other rites included masks, and of particular importance were fertility rites. The Simo were also one of many secret "cultic groups" (whose priests "possessed immense knowledge of herbs and roots") that practiced medicine to cure specific ailments.
Observations by early white ethnographers.
French explorer René Caillié, the first European to travel to Timbuktu and return alive, described a group of young men living in the forest along the Nunez River after being initiated (through circumcision) by a man called the Simo, who is never seen by anyone except for his young companions who stay with him for seven or eight years. The Simo also acts as a chief magistrate to the locals; his place of residence in the forest is to be left in peace at all time and infractions have to be atoned for with gifts handed over in a ritual manner--with the giver keeping his back to the Simo.
According to a 1908 study by Hutton Webster, the Simo had degenerated from a "powerful organization devoted to the interests of the people" into little more than a group that organized dances and dressed up.
Masks.
Masks, decorated with "animal, reptile and human attributes" are used in ritual.

North Carolina Music Hall of Fame

The North Carolina Music Hall of Fame is a non-profit organization and museum that was created to honor musicians, composers and artists with ties to North Carolina that have made significant impact in the music industry. The museum serves as a clearinghouse for North Carolina musicians from all time periods, and preserves a number of memorabilia artifacts for public display.
The museum is currently located at the renovated site of the old Kannapolis, North Carolina, city jail at 109 West A Street.
History.
The organization was founded in 1994 by businessmen Doug Croft and Joe Carroll. Originally located in Thomasville, North Carolina, the group inducted seven people in 1999 and one in 2002. Suffering from a lack of space, a historic city jail in Kannapolis, North Carolina, was chosen as the new location. Full renovation began in 2008, with the museum completed 7 months later in 2009.
Much of the renewed interest in the NC Music Hall of Fame was driven by music industry mogul Mike Curb who has ties to Kannapolis and is friends with David Murdock who was building the Kannapolis-based North Carolina Research Campus. He worked out a deal to buy and renovate the old city jail and police station. Curb also has his close friend and North Carolina native, music executive Eddie Ray, become operations director to oversee the day-to-day for the organization.
Mike Curb and Eddie Ray were both inducted into the Hall in 2009. Mike Curb for his contribution and support of the Hall of Fame and Eddie Ray for his lifetime achievement in the music non-performer category.
In 2012, the organization hosted its first induction ceremony open to the public. Being held at the Vintage Motor Club Conference & Events Center in nearby Concord, North Carolina allowed the group to sell tickets to the event.
Criteria for inclusion.
Musicians that were either born in North Carolina or have made it their home are eligible for induction 10 years after their entry into the music industry. Inductees are not limited to music performers, and producers, industry executives and educators are also eligible for induction.
Inductees.
Some of the inductees include (with year inducted):

Jonathan Moore has a gift at creating an open, relaxed, joyous environment in which you can create easily and feel so supported.The cast are fantastic, and I feel privileged to be working with each and every one of them. Funny, clever, super talented and supportive. I have learned so much just watching them do their thing. It is a treat working with Stephen Tompkinson, such a fabulous actor that I can learn so much from, and surreal to be working with someone who I have admired for years. Christopher Patrick Nolan is so focused and talented and I’ve loved working with him. And Paul Joseph is a one off, a talented young man that makes me laugh with pretty much every move he makes. I guess we can surmise I’m pretty chuffed. "
Reviewers of the play commented that Norton and Tompkinson shared a good on stage rapport and her performance was compelling.

Speaking about the production with co-star Melanie Hill, Norton stated that the characters in the play were "extreme" and all "interweaved into each others lives." Delving into her character, Norton explained Chelle's journey, "She has had a baby really young, has got trapped in this life she does not want to be in. She's really bitter and regretful, mourning for the life she has lost. She feels her life has been taken away from her and that's why she gets her claws into this young lass, whose life she wants. She is vile."
Early in 2012, Norton also appeared in "I’m Sorry – Present:Tense with Nabakov" a play based around a specific topic effecting the local area of Newcastle. After development of the idea a theme was selected after it featured heavily in The Newcastle Chronicle. It was announced that the series of plays would focus on "How Government cuts are disproportionally affecting women."
Alongside James Baxter and Chloe Allen, Norton was selected to feature in the week long project under the directorship of Phil Ormrod.

South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour

The South Mole is a breakwater located in the southern section of Gibraltar Harbour, in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. Previously known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension, the South Mole, with the rest of harbour, is just north of the east entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.
History.
The South Mole at Gibraltar Harbour is one of a trio of breakwaters that provides protection to the harbour, in addition to that which results from the presence of the Rock of Gibraltar on its east side. The South Mole is positioned at the southwestern aspect of the harbour, and is in length. The Gibdock shipyard and Royal Naval base are also in the southern section of the harbour, the wharfage of the shipyard including of the South Mole. Repair berths along the breakwater can accommodate vessels up to 150,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). During construction in the 1880s, a railway and two new tunnels were created to take large quantities of quarried stone to assist in the Mole's creation. One of these tunnels was by Camp Bay and the other was under the Parson's Lodge Battery. 
The north end of the South Mole, its "A" Head, is the site of the Gibraltar South Mole Lighthouse. The location gives the tower its alternate name of the Gibraltar "A" Head Lighthouse. Its light characteristic is a quick, flashing white light, with a range of fifteen nautical miles. The black, cast-iron, skeletal tower continues to be active as an aid to navigation and is operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority.
The south entrance to Gibraltar Harbour, between the "A" Head of the South Mole and the "B" Head of the Detached Mole, is controlled by the Queen's Harbourmaster. Berths utilised by U.S. Navy ships on the South Mole include Piers 48, 49, and 50. 
The South Mole was formerly known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension, to distinguish it from the Old Mole at the northeastern corner of the harbour. Construction of the New Mole was begun by the Spanish in 1620. It underwent extension a variety of times, eventually reaching a length of . It was built of rubble stone. The New Mole Extension was added about the turn of the twentieth century. The extension, together with the New Mole length of , resulted in a total length of for the New Mole and New Mole Extension together, by 1911. This is more than the length indicated by the Gibraltar Port Authority one hundred years later, in 2011. In 1916, the length of the south entrance to the harbour was reported to be . At that time, coal stores lined almost the entire length of the South Mole.
SS Rosslyn.
In January 1916, the SS Rosslyn, a more than 3,600 ton steamship commanded by Captain William Fishey, departed from Liverpool, England. The ship was 340 feet long and built in 1902. After the ship's cargo was unloaded at Muros, Spain, the captain was directed to set a course for Gibraltar, where he was instructed to anchor off the South Mole, outside the harbour. After an uneventful week at anchor, the weather changed for the worse on 27 February 1916. The following day, gale force winds repeatedly dashed the ship against the recently completed South Mole. Despite the efforts of tugs provided by the Royal Navy and the Gibraltar Harbour authority, the ship sank off the South Mole. The "Gibraltar Chronicle" of 1 March 1916 reported: 
The SS Rosslyn was the largest wreck in Gibraltar and is now a popular site with divers.

East Village, London

East Village is an area of East London that was designed and constructed as the Olympic Village of the 2012 Summer Games and is currently being converted for use as a new residential district. The area was formerly contaminated land and industrial buildings to the north of Stratford.
History.
Planning and construction.
As part of the regeneration programme within the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Olympic Village design that will house the athletes was based in reusing the buildings after the games as a new residential district for Stratford. Through a competitive bidding process, the then Labour British government choose a proposal by Lend Lease Project Management & Construction, formerly Bovis plc now a s up peeps division of Lend Lease Corporation of Australia, which covered financing and construction of both the Olympic Village and part of the London Olympics Media Centre. This would provide both accommodation for 24,000 athletes, and afterwards provide a mix of low cost and private residential housing, within a community that would comprise offices, shops, schools and a health centre.
Lend Lease engaged a team of: architects Fletcher Priest; structural engineers Arup; and urban planning/landscape architecture firm West 8. They were briefed to design a village-garden type district to fit in with the wider urban park vision of the Olympic Park legacy, emulating the classical Victorian architecture layout of Maida Vale and other parts of Victorian west London. On a site, the plan provided for 11 residential plots, each made up of 5 to 7 blocks, built around communal squares and courtyards, with water features accentuating the closeness of the River Lea. Each of the 67 blocks is of between 8 and 12 storeys high, nominally laid out: Street level of mostly three storey townhouses, with front doors on street level to create an "active frontage". These are supplemented by a mix of single to three storey shops and offices. Floor 3 and above in the centre of the complex are communal raised gardens, which hide carparks beneath. At and above this level are a mix of low cost and private residential apartments, ranging from one to five bedroom. Each apartment provides generous floor spacing, and each includes its own balcony that is big enough for a table and chairs.
The whole Olympic Park site was proposed to be secured under a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) by the London Development Agency. In late 2005, a row broke out between then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone and Newham Council/Westfield Group over the use of the legal instrument. The site for the Olympic Village was to be located next to the £4Bn development of Stratford City, but access difficulties meant that the Olympic Park CPO extended onto the site for Stratford City. In November 2005, an agreement was made where by the CPO over the Westfield site was removed, subject to agreed access provisions to the Olympic Village.
In light of the 2008 financial crisis, Lend Lease found difficulties in raising funds for the construction of the village on the commercial markets, the single largest project in the 2012 Summer Olympic scheme. The government via the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) hence agreed to underwrite a greater part of the required sum, and a scale-back of the project scale by 25%, on the proviso that athletes competing in non-London based events would be housed locally to their competition. Following the athletes' experiences in Beijing 2008, and in particular through comments concerning athletes' welfare by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, this compromise was to be reconsidered whilst pressure built for the finance deal to be resolved.
Up until this point, the proposed site had been a mix of former industrial buildings and contaminated land. The proposed site for the village provided two living camp sites for Irish Travellers, one on Clays Lane, Newham, and a second on Waterden Crescent, Hackney. The final part of the Olympic CPO covering the village site, secured in December 2006, was unsuccessfully challenged by the travellers in the High Court in May 2007. Towards the end of demolition/site clearance, in November 2007 a fire broke out in an old warehouse on Waterden Road, Hackney Wick, on the western-edge of the proposed village site. With flames of in height engulfing the building and sending clouds of acrid black smoke over the city centre, it took 75 firefighters from the London Fire Brigade to bring the fire under control.
Olympic and Paralympic village.
During the summer of 2012, the first use for the blocks was as the Olympic Village for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Taking the original design, the architects added temporary partitioning to create "hotel" style apartments catering for: 3,300 apartments: each will have a TV, internet access, and a private courtyard; and 17,320 beds (this is around 17,000 for athletes ~ 10903 (total number of them) and rest for officials during the Games): providing each athlete with floor space. In addition, the developers added two temporary buildings: a food hall, which was open 24 hours a day, capable of catering for 5,500 athletes at a time; and an entertainment hall of , providing games and communal rest space, plus a non-alcoholic bar. The village also included a plaza, where athletes were able to meet with friends and family.
After the Games.
On conclusion of the games, the site is being used to create a new residential quarter to be known as East Village. This will create 2,818 new homes, including 1,379 affordable homes and houses, for sale and rent. The wider community is planned with wide vistas filled with gardens, parks and communal areas, within which are to be housed a school, a health clinic and shops. Having sold the affordable homes to Triathlon Homes in 2009 for £268 million, a competitive tender was issued in 2008 for ODA's interests in the remaining 1,439 private homes, along with six adjacent future development plots with the potential for a further 2,000 new homes, and long-term management of East Village. The ODA received three bids: a joint-venture between James Ritblat's Delancey and Qatari Diar; Hutchison Whampoa; and Wellcome Trust, who bid to take over all the Olympic park. In August 2011, the ODA announced an agreement with Delancey/Qatari Diar, who paid £557 million for the East Village site, representing an estimated £275 million loss to the ODA and hence the British taxpayer. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt commented that the ODA never expected to recoup building costs: ""It was an entirely empty site, it didn't have any infrastructure, roads or parks. There was always going to be a public sector contribution to help put those in.""
Temporary partitions installed during the games are being removed to create a range of one to five bed homes, ranging from apartments to townhouses. The hotel style designed rooms are being converted to include kitchens. The majority of the 1,439 private homes are to be let on a rental basis, instead of being sold, with the ownership remaining with Delancey/Qatari Diar. This will create the first UK private sector residential fund of over 1,000 homes to be owned and directly managed as an investment. In addition, the developers will create new parklands and additional transport links, and have added Chobham Academy a new education campus with 1,800 places for students aged 3–19. During the Olympics the school building was used as the main base for organising and managing teams. Rebuilt after the games, it opened in September 2013 as Chobham Academy, home to an education campus comprising: a nursery, primary and secondary schools, an adult learning facility; a community arts complex; A health centre for residents of East Village and the surrounding areas is also being constructed.
Transport.
It is located close to Stratford International station with fast services to central London (in 7–8 minutes) via High Speed One, on Southeastern trains, but not Eurostar, whose trains do not stop at the station. The Docklands Light Railway gives direct access to much of the East of London, and is one stop from Stratford station, which itself gives access to the Great Eastern Main Line and Lea Valley Lines, plus the Central Line and Jubilee Lines of the London Underground.
London Bus routes 97, 308 and 339 and night route N205 serve East Village. Also, route D8 stops nearby at Stratford International and routes 58, 69 and 158 stops nearby on Leyton High Road along with route 97.
Generally, walking distance from Big Ben is about . However, stations such as Stratford International are located in Travelcard zone 3, which means that public transport ticket cost would be higher, especially for travels to central zone 1. This wasn't big problem at the Olympics, because for every competition day there was attached all-zones free travel day card, but as of 2013 fares for a single journey can be nearly 30% more costly.
Sustainability.
Residential accommodation was designed to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4.
Plot N25, car park for Stratford International Station achieved CEEQUAL Excellent 
Permanent and temporary timber used was externally verified and audited and the project achieved Full Project FSC certification (2009: TT-PRO-002826) on 31 January 2012.
In construction the project achieved three Gold awards from the Considerate Constructors Scheme in 2010, 2011 and 2012, project registration references: 32454,36861 and 46760.

Uruguayan constitutional referendum, 1942

A constitutional referendum was held in Uruguay on 29 November 1942, alongside general elections. The new constitution was approved by 77.17% of voters.
Background.
On 18 June 1941 a group of General Assembly members had put forward constitutional amendments. However, it was clear that the proposals would not be approved by a majority of voters, and President Alfredo Baldomir subsequently dissolved the General Assembly on 21 February 1942.
A commission, composed of the largest party, put forward a draft constitution on 28 May, with some small changes to the previous amendments. Baldomir then issued a decree stating that the new constitution would be approved if a majority of those voting were in favour, rather than the previous requirement, established in the 1934 constitution, of a majority of registered voters voting in favour.
New constitution.
The new constitution would limit the President and Vice President to a single term in office. It provided for a bicameral General Assembly, with a Senate elected by proportional representation. The lema system would be abolished.
Constitutional initiatives would be possible if supported by 10% of registered voters (reduced from 20%), with the General Assembly allowed to put forward a counter-proposal. Amendments would require a majority vote in both houses of the General Assembly, approval by a Constitutional Council, and then a referendum, in which at least 35% of registered voters must vote in favour.

The Helping Hand (halfway house)

The Helping Hand (also known as THH) is a halfway house in Singapore, registered as a Singapore non-governmental organization. The stated objective of the organization is to "transform lives of ex-offenders through the love of Jesus Christ into restored and hardworking individuals, re-integrating them back into society as stable and contributing citizens"
History and Working Model.
The Helping Hand was founded in 1987 by Robert Yeo, a Heroin addict. It is registered as a Voluntary Welfare Organization under the Singapore Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports with an Institution of Public Character Status.
The organization aims to rehabilitate drug offenders through its stated method of 4 types of therapy - Spiritual, Work, Social and Physical. Drug offenders in therapy (called the Residents) typically undergo 3–6 months of treatment, during which they will receive individual and group counselling. Residents stay at The Helping Hand premises (located in Serangoon) throughout their therapy.
Funding.
The Helping Hand receives operational cash primarily from sales from the furniture business that it operates. The prices are priced at 10 percent to 20 percent lower than the market rate. It can thus be defined as a social enterprise. Its premises at Serangoon serves as a warehouse where it showcases hundreds of Indonesian made Teak furniture to the public. The Helping Hand also gets income from its moving services. They hire Residents as workers for both services.
It was reported in 2011 that even though more and more people are engaging its services, The Helping Hand still faces stigma from its businesses as most of its workers are ex-addicts.
Side Ventures.
The Helping Hand also engages in many side ventures started by Residents. These services include computer repairs and gardening services. The main aim of these ventures is to help former offenders instead of generating profits. These ventures are usually started when Residents indicate interest in a certain business they wish to explore.

Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation

Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation which is also called the Quality Certificate, Safety Certificate of the Customs Certificate appears to be the document that proves that the products or services correspond to law requirements of safety and quality in Russia.
Types.
Now there are two types of Correspondence Certificate in Russia: the GOST certificate of Correspondence to National Standards and the Certificate of Correspondence to a Technical Reglamentation. The explanation of this is as follows: the Technical Reglamentations began being developed and enforced not long ago and that is why they are not able to regulate the Certification Process in Russia in full form. Until the technical Reglamentation replace the GOST Standards, the latest also take part in regulation of the certification process on the Russian territory It should also mentioned proving correspondence to Technical Conditions (TC), but generally this method is used in voluntary certification
The term.
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationmay be given only by an authorized organ in the sphere of certification. The document may be given for the period of 1, 2 or 3 years in the case of series production. If the certificate is given for the party of the products, its term is unlimited. Such type of certification is typical for the parties of foreign products that are delivered into the Russian territory according invoice or a contract.
How to get.
It is possible to receive the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation after providing the documents package to the certification center. One of the necessary documents required for certification is the test protocol. The document may be given by any laboratory authorized for certification tests after testing the products for correspondence to legislative requirements. Generally certification laboratories check the products for environmental and consumer safety as well as they correspond to the claimed characteristics mentioned in technical documentation to the real characteristics.
The schemes of certification.
Scheme 1.
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationmay be drawn up according to the contract. In this case the certificate must contain the date about products tests (the date and the number of the testing protocol). The certificate of this type generally includes the correct name of the Certificate Receiver and the Product Manufacturer, the date and the number of the contract and the scheme of certification. Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationis generally drawn up in the case when the import is not limited by the one-time delivery of the products. After drawing up such document the applicant may import production during a year.
Scheme 2.
The Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be drawn up for the party of products. In such case there is no need in drawing up the testing protocol, but the certificate must include the date and the number of invoice. Such kind of certificates is drawn up when importing the test party of some kin of products because it is valid only for a limited party of goods. The Correspondence Certificate is provided with the open date. Generally, this kind of certificate is given, for example, for equipment
Scheme 3.
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationfor the serial output of production may be drawn up only after certification tests. It is valid from one to three years. This kind of document may be drawn up by both inner and foreign manufacturer.
The ways of getting Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation.
Manufacturers may get the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation both obligatory and voluntary. The voluntary Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation is drawn up on the yellow blank while the voluntary on – on the blue blank. By the voluntary certification it is the manufacturer who chooses the parameters on which to certificate. That is the reason why the voluntary certification is used by large manufacturers and the trade representatives for proving of the correspondence of their production to the requirements of TС as well as to additional GOST standards which are not used by the obligatory certification.

<doc id="36558703" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36558703" title="Brain connectivity estimators">
Brain connectivity estimators

Brain connectivity estimators represent patterns of links in the brain. Connectivity can be considered at different levels of the brain's organisation: from neurons, to neural assemblies and brain structures. Brain connectivity involves different concepts such as: neuroanatomical or structural connectivity (pattern of anatomical links), functional connectivity (usually understood as statistical dependencies) and effective connectivity (referring to causal interactions). Neuroanatomical connectivity is inherently difficult to define given the fact that at the microscopic scale of neurons, new synaptic connections or elimination of existing ones are formed dynamically and are largely dependent on the function executed, but may be considered as pathways extending over regions of the brain, which are in accordance with general anatomical knowledge. DTI can be used to provide such information. 
The distinction between functional and effective connectivity is not always sharp; sometimes causal or directed connectivity is called functional connectivity. Functional connectivity, may be defined as the temporal correlation (in terms of statistically significant dependence between distant brain regions) among the activity of different neural assemblies, whereas effective connectivity may be defined as the direct or indirect influence that one neural system exerts over another.
Some brain connectivity estimators evaluate connectivity from brain activity time series such as EEG, LFP or spike trains, with an impact on the directed connectivity. These estimators can be applied to fMRI data, if the required image sequences are available.
Among estimators of connectivity, there are linear and non-linear, bivariate and multivariate measures. Certain estimators also indicate directionality. Different methods of connectivity estimation vary in their effectiveness. This article provides an overview of these measures, with an emphasis on the most effective methods.
Bi-variate estimators.
Classical methods.
Classical estimators of connectivity are correlation and coherence. The above measures provide information on the directionality of interactions in terms of delay (correlation) or coherence (phase), however the information does not imply causal interaction. Moreover it may be ambiguous, since phase is determined modulo 2π. It is also not possible to identify by means of correlation or coherence reciprocal connections.
Non-linear methods.
Most frequently used nonlinear estimators of connectivity are: mutual information, Transfer Entropy, Generalised Synchronisation, Continuity Measure, Synchronization Likelihood, Phase Synchronization. First two of them rely on construction of histograms for estimation of probabilities. Continuity Measure, Generalized Synchronisations, Synchronisation Likelihood are very similar methods based on reconstruction of phase space of signals. Among these measures only Transfer Entropy allows for the determination of directionality. According to, nonlinear measures require long stationary segments of signals, are prone to systematic errors and above all are very sensitive to noise. The comparison of nonlinear methods with linear correlation in the presence of noise revealed the poorer performance of non-linear estimators. In the authors conclude that there must be good reason to think that there is non-linearity in the data to apply non-linear methods. In fact it was demonstrated by means of surrogate data test, and time series forecasting that non linearity in EEG and LFP is the exception rather than a rule. On the other hand linear methods perform quite well also for non-linear signals. Finally, non-linear methods are bivariate (calculated pair-wise), which has serious implication on their performance.
Bivariate versus multivariate estimators.
Comparison of performance of bivariate and multivariate estimators of connectivity may be found in, where it was demonstrated that in case of interrelated system of channels, greater than two, bivariate methods supply misleading information, even reversal of true propagation may be found.
Let us consider very common situation that the activity from a given source is measured at electrodes positioned at different distances, hence different delays between the recorded signals. This situation can be illustrated by the simulation shown in Fig.1.
When we apply bivariate measure we will obtain the propagation always when there is a delay between channels. In this way we get a lot of spurious flows. When we have two or three sources acting simultaneously, which is quite common situation we shall get dense and disorganized structure of connections, similar to random structure (at best some "small world" structure may be identified). This kind of pattern is usually obtained in case of application of bivariate measures. In fact, effective connectivity patterns yielded by EEG or LFP measurements are far from randomness, when proper multivariate measures are applied, as we shall demonstrate below.
Multivariate methods based on Granger causality.
The testable definition of causality was introduced by Granger. Granger causality principle states that if some series "Y"("t") contains information in past terms that helps in the prediction of series "X"("t"), then "Y"("t") is said to cause "X"("t"). Granger causality principle can be expressed in terms of two-channel multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR). Granger in his later work pointed out that the determination of causality is not possible when the system of considered channels is not complete.
The measures based on Granger causality principle are: Granger Causality Index (GCI), Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). These measures are defined in the framework of Multivariate Autoregressive Model.
Multivariate Autoregressive Model.
The AR model assumes that "X"("t")—a sample of data at a time "t"—can be expressed as a sum of "p" previous values of the samples from the set of "k"-signals weighted by model coefficients "A" plus a random value "E"("t"):
The "p" is called the model order. For a "k"-channel process "X"("t") and "E"("t") are vectors of size "k" and the coefficients "A" are "k"×"k"-sized matrices.
The model order may be determined by means of criteria developed in the framework of information theory and the coefficients of the model are found by means of the minimalization of the residual noise. In the procedure correlation matrix between signals is calculated.
By the transformation to the frequency domain we get:
 
"H"("f") is a transfer matrix of the system, it contains information about the relationships between signals and their spectral characteristics. "H"("f") is non-symmetric, so it allows for finding causal dependencies.
Model order may be found by means of criteria developed in the framework of information theory, e.g. AIC criterion.
Granger Causality Index.
Granger causality index showing the driving of channel "x" by channel "y" is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of residual variance for one channel to the residual variance of the two-channel model:
GCI"y"→"x" = ln ("e"/"e"1) 
This definition can be extended to the multichannel system by considering how the inclusion of the given channel changes the residual variance ratios. To quantify directed influence from a channel "x""j" to "x""i" for "n" channel autoregressive process in time domain we consider "n" and "n"−1 dimensional MVAR models. First, the model is fitted to whole "n"-channel system, leading to the residual variance "V""i","n"(t) = var("E""i","n"("t")) for signal "x""i". Next, a "n"−1 dimensional MVAR model is fitted for "n"−1 channels, excluding channel "j", which leads to the residual variance "V""i","n"−1(t) = var ("E""i","n"−1("t")). Then Granger causality is defined as:
formula_1
GCI is smaller or equal 1, since the variance of "n"-dimensional system is lower than the residual variance of a smaller, "n"−1 dimensional system. 
GCI("t") estimates causality relations in time domain. For brain signals the spectral characteristics of the signals is of interest, because for a given task the increase of propagation in certain frequency band may be accompanied by the decrease in another frequency band. DTF or PDC are the estimators defined in the frequency domain.
Directed Transfer Function.
Directed Transfer Function (DTF) was introduced by Kaminski and Blinowska in the form:
Where "Hij"("f") is an element of a transfer matrix of MVAR model.
DTF describes causal influence of channel "j" on channel "i" at frequency "f". The above equation () defines a normalized version of DTF, which takes values from 0 to 1 producing a ratio between the inflow from channel "j" to channel "i" to all the inflows to channel "i". 
The non-normalized DTF which is directly related to the coupling strength is defined as:
DTF shows not only direct, but also cascade flows, namely in case of propagation 1→2→3 it shows also propagation 1→3. In order to distinguish direct from indirect flows direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) was introduced. 
The dDTF is defined as a multiplication of a modified DTF by partial coherence. The modification of DTF concerned normalization of the function in such a way as to make the denominator independent of frequency. The dDTF"j"→"i" showing direct propagation from channel "j" to "i" is defined as:
Where "Cij"("f") is partial coherence. The dDTF"j"→"i" has a nonzero value when both functions "Fij"("f") and "Cij"("f") are non-zero, in that case there exists a direct causal relation between channels "j"→"i". 
Distinguishing direct from indirect transmission is essential in case of signals from implanted electrodes, for EEG signals recorded by scalp electrodes it is not really important.
The preprocessing of signals before DTF computation (and in general in case of estimators based on MVAR) merits special attention. The preprocessing should be limited to the subtraction of mean value and possibly division by variance of each signal. Possible filtering of signals should be performed forward and backward in order not to disturb the phases (in Matlab procedure filtfilt). The signals should be referenced in respect to inactive electrode (e.g. linked ears), no bipolar, common average or Hjorth derivation should be used. The fitting of MVAR coefficients is based on calculation of correlation matrix between channels and these relations should not be distorted in any way, since they reflect phase dependence between channels and estimators of directed connectivity are based on phase differences. This issue will be addressed more extensively in the Section 1.4.
DTF may be used for estimation of propagation in case of point processes e.g. spike trains or for the estimation of causal relations between spike trains and Local Field Potentials.
The software for calculation of DTF, dDTF and time-varying version of DTF—SDTF—may be found at portal http://eeg.pl. In this website also tutorial on DTF is available.
Partial Directed Coherence.
The partial directed coherence (PDC) was defined by Baccala and Sameshima in the following form:
In the above equation "Aij"("f") is an element of "A"("f")—a Fourier transform of MVAR model coefficients "A"("t"), where a"j"("f") is "j"-th column of "A"("f") and the asterisk denotes the transpose and complex conjugate operation. Although it is a function operating in the frequency domain, the dependence of "A"("f") on the frequency has not a direct correspondence to the power spectrum. From normalization condition it follows that PDC takes values from the interval [0,1]. PDC shows only direct flows between channels. Unlike DTF, PDC is normalized to show a ratio between the outflow from channel "j" to channel "i" to all the outflows from the source channel "j", so it emphasizes rather the sinks, not the sources. The normalization of PDC has an impact on the detected intensities of flow as was pointed out in. Namely, adding further variables that are influenced by a source variable decreases PDC, although the relationship between source and target processes remains unchanged. In another words: the flow emitted in one direction will be enhanced in comparison to the flows of the same intensity emitted from a given source in several directions.
DTF and PDC are not influenced by volume conduction.
Volume conduction influences the amplitudes of electric field measured on scalp, which is well established fact, however the situation is different, if we consider phases of the signals.
DTF and PDC are based on the detection of phase differences between channels, they take zero value when there are no phase difference. This fact was supported by the simulation. To the set of EEG signals the sinusoid of 20 Hz and constant phase was added. In the power spectra a distinct peak of 20 Hz was observed, while no trace of 20 Hz activity was observed in DTF and PDC. (Fig. 2).
Volume conduction is propagation of electromagnetic field with a speed of light — 3⋅1010 cm/s. For the distance of the order of centimeter the delay is roughly 3.3⋅10−9 s. Such delay cannot be practically detected.
The propagation speed of electrical activity in cortex depends on axonal and dendritic conduction velocity and synaptic delays. Recordings in monkey showed that delays of activation of neighboring areas in cortex (e.g. V1 and V2) range between 10-20 ms. Similar delays are obtained by calculating the speed of propagation in neural fibers and taking into account synaptic delays (1-5 ms). The resulting delays in propagation are of the order of tenths of ms and can be detected by proper estimators assuming typical sampling rates.
The propagation shown by DTF or PDC is due to the delays in the neural tracts. The depolarization wave propagating along neural fiber causes along its way oscillatory activity delayed in respect to source. This activity is recorded on scalp and delays between the electrodes are detected by these phase sensitive estimators. The sensitivity of connectivity estimators, based on Granger causality, to the changes of phase was demonstrated in, where it was reported that filters influencing phases disturb connectivity values.
The pattern of phases should not be disturbed in any way. It is coded in the correlation matrix of MVAR model. Therefore the signals should be recorded in respect to some "neutral" electrode such as "linked ears", nose, etc. Common average, Hjorth or Laplace transform should not be used, since they change the correlation matrix between channels and hence phases. When calculating DTF or PDC the preprocessing should be limited to the subtraction of average and possibly filtering without changing the phases.
In the light of robustness of DTF and PDC to volume conduction the procedures performing projection of the scalp potentials on the cortex or application of ICA are not needed, on the contrary they spoil the correlation relation between channels and what they show are may be some causality relations between e.g. some abstract ICA components, but not the propagation of EEG activity. Inspecting papers where such preprocessing routines were used it is easy to see that the results are usually hard to interpret in terms of other neurophysiological evidence. The results obtained by DTF without heavy preprocessing demonstrate very good agreement with temporal and topographical evidence supplied by imaging methods or neurophysiological evidence (section Applications below).
Time-varying estimators of effective connectivity.
In order to account for the dynamic changes of propagation, the method of adaptive filtering or the method based on the sliding window may be applied to the estimators of connectivity. Both methods require multiple repetition of the experiment to obtain statistically satisfactory results and they produce similar results. The adaptive methods e.g. Kalman filter are more computationally demanding, therefore the methods based on sliding window may be recommended.
In the case of parametric model the number of data points "kNT" ("k"—number of channels, "NT"—number of points in the data window) has to be bigger (preferably by order of magnitude) than the number of parameters, which in case of MVAR is equal to "k"2"p" ("p"—model order). In order to evaluate dynamics of the process, short data window has to be applied, which requires the increase of the number of the data points, which may achieved by means of the repetition of the experiment. We divide a non-stationary recording into shorter time windows, short enough to treat the data within a window as quasi-stationary. The estimation of MVAR coefficients is based on calculation of the correlation matrix "Rij" of "k" signals "Xi" from multivariate set. We calculate the correlation matrix between channels for each trial separately. The resulting model coefficients are based on the correlation matrix averaged over trials. The correlation matrix has a form:
The averaging concerns correlation matrices (model is fitted independently for each short data window); the data is not averaged in the process. The choice of the window size is always a compromise between quality of the fit and time resolution.
The errors of the SDTF may be evaluated by means of bootstrap method. This procedure corresponds to simulations of the another realizations of the experiment. The variance of the function value is obtained by repeated calculation of the results for a randomly selected (with repetitions) pool of the original data trials.
Applications.
Directed transfer Function found multiple applications, the early ones involved: localization of epileptic foci, estimation of EEG propagation in different sleep stages and wakefulness, determination of transmission between brain structures of an animal during a behavioral test.
The patterns of directed connectivity for wakefulness and different sleep stages averaged over subjects are shown in Fig. 3.
One may observe the shifting of sources toward the front in transition from wakefulness to the deeper sleep stages. In the deep sleep the source is over corpus callosum, presumably it is connected with feeding the cortex from the sub-cortical structures.
One of the first applications of SDTF was determination of the dynamic propagation during performance of finger movement and its imagination. The results corresponded very well with the known phenomena of event related synchronization and desynchronization such as decrease of the activity in alpha and beta band and brief increase of activity in the gamma band during movement in the areas corresponding to primary motor cortex, beta rebound after movement and so-called surround effect. Especially interesting was comparison of real finger movement and its imagination. In case of real movement the short burst of gamma propagation was observed from the electrode positioned over finger primary motor cortex . In case of movement imagination this propagation started later and a cross-talk between different sites overlying motor area and supplementary motor area was found. (The dynamics of propagation may be observed in animations available at: http://brain.fuw.edu.pl/~kjbli/DTF_MOV.html).
Another applications of SDTF concerned evaluation of transmission during cognitive experiments. The results of the Continuous Attention Test (CAT) confirmed the engagement of pre-frontal and frontal structures in the task and supported the hypothesis of an active inhibition by Pre-Supplementary Motor Area and right Inferior Frontal Cortex. The animations of propagation during CAT test are available at URL http://brain.fuw.edu.pl/~kjbli/CAT_MOV.html.
The results obtained by means of SDTF in experiments involving working memory were compatible with fMRI studies on the localization of the active sites and supplied the information concerning the temporal interaction between them. The animation illustrating dynamics of the interaction are available at http://brain.fuw.edu.pl/~kjbli/Cognitive_MOV.html.
Conclusions.
In all studies when DTF (without unnecessary preprocessing) was applied to EEG or LFP distinct pattern of active sources was observed and their localizations were compatible with existing evidence obtained by means of another techniques and with neurophysiological evidence or hypotheses.
The existence of well defined sources of brain activity connected with particular experimental conditions are well established in fMRI experiments, by means of inverse solution methods and intracortical measurements. This kind of deterministic structure of brain activity should have an impact on functional connectivity, so reported in some works random or barely distinguished from random connectivity structure may be considered as a surprising phenomenon. This kind of results may be explained by methodological errors: 1) unrobust methods of connectivity estimation and, even more important, 2) application of bivariate methods. When multivariate robust measures of connectivity are applied for EEG analysis a clear picture of functional connectivity emerges.

<doc id="36558833" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36558833" title="Revolutionary Stewards">
Revolutionary Stewards

During the First World War (1914-1918), the Revolutionary Stewards (German: "Revolutionäre Obleute") were shop stewards who were independent from the official unions and freely chosen by workers in various German industries. They rejected the war policies of the German empire and the support which parliamentary representatives of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) gave to these policies. They also played a role during the German Revolution of 1918–19.
Background.
The SPD, at the time the largest workers' party in Europe, voted for war credits for the imperial government in 1914. Karl Liebknecht was initially the only SPD member of the Reichstag who publicly rejected the measure. He was absent for the vote in August and then voted against the measure in December 1914. With the split between the USPD and the "Majority" SPD there was a party in the Reichstag opposing the so-called policy of "party truce" ("Burgfriedenspolitik") between the various political forces. The Stewards supported the USPD's outright opposition to the war.
January 1918: Anti-war strike.
Since most of the union functionaries supported the political truce, the Stewards created an opposition of industrial workers against the First World War in Germany. This was in part a reaction to the growing number of deaths on the front and the growing social need at home. Their most important speakers were Richard Müller and Emil Barth. The Revolutionary Stewards were especially strongly represented in the Berlin armament industry. They had already had experience with strikes, including the protest strike against the imprisonment of Karl Liebknecht in summer 1916 and the wave of strikes centered around Braunschweig and Leipzig in January 1917.
The Stewards were a crucial force in organizing the January Strike of 1918, which was centred on Berlin, the Ruhr, Saxony, Hamburg and Kiel and in which strikers demanded the end of the war through a negotiated peace and a democratisation of the empire. They were in part inspired by the success achieved by the communist bolshevists under Lenin and Trotsky in the Russian October Revolution only a few months earlier. For this reason, the strikes were also directed against plans of annexation, which Central Powers Germany and Austria-Hungary were pursuing in ongoing peace negotiations with Soviet Russia in Brest-Litovsk. The strikers demanded fundamental political changes within Germany as well as a just peace agreement with Russia that did not include territorial claims by the German Empire against the "New Russia". These demands were not met by the Supreme Army Command (or "Oberste Heeresleitung") and the imperial government of Chancellor Georg von Hertling. 
The strike was ended when the "Oberste Heeresleitung" declared an aggravated state of siege, put some factories under military protection and conscripted many of the striking workers for military service. 
November Revolution and Council Movement.
November 1918: revolution.
In the early days of November 1918, the Revolutionary Stewards were one of the few political groups demanding an end to the monarchy. In addition, unlike the "Majority" SPD of Friedrich Ebert they were also in favour of "socialisation" of industries and government by workers' (and soldiers') councils rather than a parliamentary system. On 2 November 1918 there was a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Stewards, also attended by Liebknecht, which voted 21 to 19 against initiating revolutionary action on 4 November as the workers were not yet disposed to act. They settled on 11 November. In Berlin, the Stewards numbered around 80 to 100. The core group numbered only about a dozen. 
On 8 November, driven by events to accelerate their plan, the Stewards called for a general strike in Berlin on the next day. The Spartacists, the SPD and the unions supported the call. On 9 November, workers' and soldiers' councils were formed, the headquarters of police was occupied and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators converged on the city centre. Imperial Chancellor Max of Baden announced that Emperor Wilhelm II had abdicated and handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert. In the afternoon Ebert grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for the future government. Yet that evening a group of several hundred followers of the Stewards occupied the Reichstag and held an impromptu debate. They called for the election of soldiers' and workers' councils the next day (one per battalion or 1,000 workers). They were to assemble at "Zirkus Busch" and elect a provisional revolutionary government—the "Rat der Volksbeauftragten".
In order to keep control of events and against his own anti-revolutionary convictions, Ebert now decided that he needed to co-opt the workers' councils and thus—whilst the formal head of government—also become the leader of the revolution. On 10 November, the SPD, led by Ebert managed to ensure that a majority of the newly elected workers' and (especially) soldiers' councils came from among their own supporters. Meanwhile, the USPD agreed to work with him and share power in the "Rat der Volksbeauftragten", the new revolutionary government. Ebert announced the pact between the two socialist parties to the assembled councils who were eager for a unified socialist front and approved the parity of three members each coming from SPD and USPD. However, the Stewards had anticipated that they would fail to prevent the SPD from dominating the "Rat der Volksbeauftragten" ("Council of the People's Deputies"). They thus called for an Executive Committee ("Aktionsausschuss") of the workers' and soldiers' councils to be set up in parallel to the "Rat der Volksbeauftragten" and that would be under the control of the stewards. Its powers were to be left deliberately vague. Emil Barth, who was presiding over the assembly, then made a tactical error by giving a long-winded speech rather than moving directly to the vote. Listeners, including Ebert, were able to deduce the Stewards' intentions from what Barth said. Ebert made another speech, declaring that the committee was superfluous, but if it was to be set up, it must be made up equally of SPD and USPD just like the "Rat der Volksbeauftragten". When Barth said that no SPD delegate must sit on the committee, the assembly exploded with protest, in particular from the soldiers' councils. After an interruption, the session continued and Barth announced an Executive Committee of 20 members: ten soldiers and ten workers. Half of the latter would be supporters of the SPD, half supporters of the Stewards. The soldiers's delegates were to be elected on 11 November. The Stewards had lost.
December 1918: congress of councils and Christmas crisis.
From 16 to 21 December 1918, the "Reichsrätekongress" or "Reichsversammlung der Arbeiter- und Soldatenräte" (Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils) met in Berlin inside the Prussian Landtag building. There was one delegate for every 200,000 citizens and 100,000 soldiers. Out of 514 delegates, around 300 came from the SPD, about 100 from the USPD (of which ten were Spartacists) and the rest were liberals, not associated with any party or members of independent revolutionary groups. The Congress took some important decisions (in each case with a broad majority):
However, the Congress also passed two resolutions that went against the interests of the SPD leadership. First, it called on the "Council of the People's Deputies" to begin immediately with the socialisation of all "suitable" industries, especially mining. Secondly, it approved the so-called "Hamburger Punkte" that called for the election of officers, for disciplinary power to lie with the soldiers' councils, no insignia of rank and no rank off-duty. However, these demands were anathema to the leadership of the military, in particular those relating to the position of the soldiers' councils vis-à-vis the regular officer corps.
These last two decisions of the Congress underscored a division regarding short-term changes to the economy, the bureaucracy and the military between a broad-based consensus across party lines of the democratic-socialist movement on the one hand, and the leadership of the SPD and the military on the other. The SPD members of the "Council of the People's Deputies" consequently dragged their feet over the implementation of these last two points, causing increasing resentment and anger among the labour movement and its more radical representatives like the Spartacists and the Stewards.
On 29 December, the only representative of the Revolutionary Stewards, Emil Barth (also a member of the USPD) and two further representatives of the USPD finally left the "Council of the People's Deputies" in protest against the events of the "Weihnachtskämpfe" (Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss), in which government troops were deployed against the "Volksmarinedivision", a unit of leftist revolutionary soldiers established on 11 November 1918. The fighting caused many on the left to accuse the leadership of the SPD of having betrayed the revolution. 
Although the Revolutionary Stewards supported the idea of a council republic rather than a parliamentary democracy, they rejected the KPD, founded on 30/31 December 1918, which pursued the same goal. This was because the KPD was not ready to accept the five conditions set by Richard Müller on behalf of the Revolutionary Stewards: withdrawal of the anti-voting decision, a program committee with equal representation, condemnation of "putschism", taking part in party publicity and abandonment of the additional name "Spartacus League". 
January 1919: January uprising.
In the atmosphere of outrage created on the left by the military action against the "Volksmarinedivision"—which Liebknecht called "Eberts Blutweihnacht" (Ebert's Bloody Christmas)—the Stewards were among the initiators of the so-called "Spartakusaufstand" (Spartacus Uprising) in January 1919. , a member of the USPD and head of the Berlin police ("Polizeipräsident"), had refused to act against the revolting sailors during the Christmas crisis. Some of his men from the "Sicherheitspolizei" had even actively supported the uprising. Paul Hirsch, Prussian Minister of the Interior, thus dismissed Eichhorn on 4 January. Notwithstanding their differences, the Stewards, the USPD and the Spartacists called for a protest demonstration in support of Eichhorn.
On 5 January 1919, around half a million people gathered at a mass demonstration in Berlin. Armed demonstrators stormed the Berlin newspaper quarter, where they occupied the editorial office of the SPD paper "Vorwärts" as well as other publishing buildings. The main railway stations were also seized. However, the force of the popular response caught the organizers by surprise. At a meeting at the police headquarters attended by 70 Stewards, ten members of the USPD led by , three representatives of the soldiers, Liebknecht and Karl Pieck for the KDP and Eichhorn. Caught up in the momentum of the hour, they lost sight of the real situiation, overestimating the support for their actions from the military in the Berlin area. They voted 80 to six to topple the government. The Stewards' representative , Karl Liebknecht (KPD) and Ledebour (USPD) now signed a proclamation demanding the toppling of Ebert's government. They wanted to prevent elections to the National Assembly and to continue with the revolution. A "provisionary revolutionary committee" was set up. It numbered 53 members, including Scholze, Liebknecht and Ledebour, and declared that it had taken over the government. Its only action, though, was to issue a call for another demonstration on the next day.
The masses reassembled on Sunday, 6 January. However, no orders came from the revolutionary leaders. In isolated actions, the "Reichsdruckerei" and a telegraph office were seized. No one occupied the government buildings—whilst some armed supporters of the Ebert government gathered around the Reichskanzlei. The masses started to disperse and by midnight the centre of Berlin had been vacated. During the day, the committee had relocated to the Marstall, the barracks of the "Volksmarinedivision", but had been asked to leave and thus returned to the police headquarters.
There they remained, when Ebert accepted mediation by those of the USPD who had left the "Council of the People's Deputies" in late December. Ebert had just one condition: the occupation of the newspapers must end. On 7 January, the revolutionary committee declined. Whilst negotiations continued, Ebert prepared for a military response. He made Gustav Noske, since the withdrawal of the USPD a member of the "Rat der Volksbeauftragten", supreme commander of the "Freikorps" and rallied the regular troops of the Berlin area to his cause. 
On the orders of Ebert, government forces commanded by Gustav Noske crushed the uprising between 9 and 12 January. Its defeat came after intense struggles, especially around the Berlin police headquarters and the publishing building of Vorwärts, in which a reported 165 people lost their lives. The dead included several prisoners who were summarily executed, some after they had approached the government forces under a flag of truce.
Decline of the Revolutionary Stewards.
The struggles, at times approaching the level of civil war, which took place in some regions of Germany in the following months put the council movement increasingly on the defensive. Various calls for regional council republics, for example in Bremen or, more famously, the Bavarian Soviet Republic, were finally suppressed with military force by regular armed forces and right-wing Freikorps troops by mid-1919.
Under the Weimar Constitution which came into force in August 1919, the republic became a pluralistic parliamentary democracy. After the defeat of the council movement, the Revolutionary Stewards still had influence and called for and helped execute a general strike against the right-wing nationalist and anti-democratic Kapp Putsch of March 1920. The strike brought the economy to a virtual stand-still and, together with the refusal of the bureaucracy to cooperate with the new government, caused the putsch to fail in a matter of days. However, in some parts of Germany, the striking workers refused to return to work and offered armed resistance to the legitimate government of president Ebert and chancellor Bauer. The most significant of these events was the Ruhr Uprising, which was crushed by Reichswehr and "Freikorps" in April 1920.
After 1920, the Stewards did not play a notable role in the German labour movement any more. Many former activists of the Revolutionary Stewards became members of the KPD, especially after the KPD merged with the left wing of the USPD when the latter split at the end of 1920. Occasionally it operated under the alternate name "United Communist Party of Germany" (VKPD). Other Stewards remained in the USPD and future related groups, or joined the SPD again, after a part of the remaining USPD returned to the SPD in 1922. Towards the end of 1922, the core of the local structures of the USPD in Berlin, which continued to exist as a small party, was composed largely of former Revolutionary Stewards.
Some Stewards who continued to follow a party-independent "antiauthoritarian" council model joined the anarcho-syndicalist Free Workers' Union of Germany (FAUD).

During the 1972–73 English football season, Leicester City F.C. competed in the Football League First Division.
Season summary.
The 1972–73 season was a disappointing one for the Foxes, finishing in 16th place in the final standings. Their only highlights during the season were a 3-2 win over champions Liverpool at Filbert Street with a Keith Weller hat-trick after being 2-0 down and also holding them to a 0-0 draw at Anfield on the final day to spoil Liverpool's title celebrations. Results generally though throughout were poor and Leicester at one point were bottom at end of November. A lack of goals as well were hard to come by but their tight defence with the experience of Cross and Manley proved dividends and the Foxes ensured survival with a solid run of just 2 defeats in their final 12 league games.

Haze meter

A haze meter measures the transparency; haze, see-through quality, and total transmittance of a material, based on how much visible light is diffused or s scattered when passing through a material. Transparency is important because a material needs to be more or less see-through depending on its practical usage, e.g. a grocery bag needs the light to be more diffused so that less can be seen while food packaging film needs the light to be less diffused so that the contents can be seen clearly. For reasons such as these haze meters are necessary to determine which material is needed for which practical purposes.
Haze is measured with a wide angle scattering test in which light is diffused in all directions which results in a loss of contrast. That percentage of light that when passing through deviates from the incident beam greater than 2.5 degrees on average is defined as haze
See through quality is measured with a narrow angle scattering test in which light is diffused in a small range with high concentration. This test measures the clarity with which finer details can be seen through the object being tested.
The haze meter also measures total transmittance. Total transmittance is the measure of the total incident light compared to the light that is actually transmitted (e.g. total transmittance). So the incident light may be 100%, but because of absorption and reflection the total transmittance may only be 94%.
The data gained from the haze meter can be transferred to a PC for further data processing to ensure a consistent product.

The Xiping Stone Classics () are a collection of Han dynasty stone carved books on various Confucian classics. They were set up at the Imperial Academy outside Luoyang in 175–183. The Classics were created by Cai Yong and a group of affiliated scholars who "petitioned the emperor to have the Confucian classics carved in stone in order to prevent their being altered to support particular points of view."
Around 200,000 characters were inscribed on 46 stelae of the seven classics recognized at the time: the "Book of Changes", "Book of Documents", "Book of Songs", "Book of Rites", "Spring and Autumn Annals", "Classic of Filial Piety" and "Analects". Only a few fragments of these tablets have survived.

Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani

Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani (died 801) was an Arab general and governor who served the Abbasid Caliphate.
Biography.
Yazid was member of the Shayban tribe, dominant in the region of Diyar Bakr in the northern Jazira. The first member of his family to rise to prominence was his uncle, Ma'n ibn Za'ida al-Shaybani, under the Umayyads. Although Ma'n fought against the Abbasid Revolution, he reconciled himself with the Abbasid regime and both he and his sons, Za'ida and Sharahil held governorships and high military posts. 
Yazid first served under Ma'n during the latter's governorship in Sistan, where Ma'n fell in battle against the local Kharijites in 769. Under Caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), he fought against Yusuf al-Barm in Khurasan, and in 782 took part in the great campaign against the Byzantine Empire under the future Caliph Harun al-Rashid's (r. 786–809). Yazid accompanied al-Mahdi's eldest son and successor al-Hadi (r. 785–786) to his governorship of Jurjan in 783/784. After al-Hadi became Caliph, Yazid supported him in his intention—ultimately cut short by his death—to remove Harun from the succession in favour of al-Hadi's own son.
Yazid's loyalty was rewarded by al-Hadi with his appointment to the governorship ("ostikan") of "Arminiya" (a large province encompassing the whole of Transcaucasia), which he governed until 788/789. His rule was harsh towards the native Christian population, and he carried out large-scale colonization of the province, particularly at Shirvan, with Arab Muslims. He was also the first of a long line of Shaybanid "ostikans", beginning with his sons, and hence the progenitor of the Mazyadid dynasty that ruled in Shirvan as autonomous and later independent emirs ("Shirvanshah") until 1027. 
After his tenure in "Arminiya", Yazid was sent to combat a Kharijite rebellion led by the fellow-Shaybanid al-Walid ibn Tarif (795/796). Yazid succeeded in defeating and killing the rebel leader in battle, ending the uprising. Yazid was re-appointed as "ostikan" in 799, in time to face the last Khazar attack on the Caliphate's Caucasian provinces, which he defeated. He died in Armenia in 801, and was succeeded by his son Asad.

Studeno, Kočevje

Studeno (; , Gottscheerish: "Sheab, Prunnsheab") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Knežja Lipa.
Name.
The name "Studeno" literally means 'spring', and it and similar forms (e.g., "Studenec, Studenci") are relatively common toponyms for places in Slovenia associated with springs. It is derived from Slavic "*studenьcь" '(walled) spring', from the adjective "*studenъ" 'cold'. Most of the German medieval attestations of such places contain the Bavarian Middle High German element "prunne" 'spring' (cf. Middle High German "brunne"). The standard German name of the village, "Brunnsee", literally means 'lake/pond formed by a spring', probably referring to a spring that was walled to collect water. The Gottscheerish form "Prunnsheab" (and the clipped form "Sheab") correspond to the standard German: "prunn(le)" 'spring' + "şéa(b)" 'lake, sea' (in Karl Schröer's transcription).
History.
In the land registry of 1574 Studeno consisted of one full farm divided into two half farms and a population between 8 and 11. In 1770 the village had four houses. In the 19th century it had five houses and a population of 14. However, by 1937, the village had only one house and a population of three. After the Second World War, there was only one house in Studeno.

By 801, when his father died, Asad was governor of Mosul, and succeeded him as "ostikan" for about a year; he was in turn succeeded by his brother Muhammad. Asad was re-appointed as "ostikan" under Caliph al-Amin (r. 809–813) to confront an uprising of the Arab settlers in Iberia under Yahya ibn Sa'id and Ismail ibn Shu'ayb. Asad was successful in quelling the revolt and capturing its leaders, but he later pardoned and released them, and because of this was dismissed from his office.

Mark Kitto

Mark Kitto is a British entrepreneur, magazine publisher, and writer notable for investing and living in the People's Republic of China. During his time in China he lived in Shanghai before relocating to Mount Mogan where he ran a restaurant and guest houses. In 2013 he announced his intention to leave, citing the welfare of his children as the deciding factor.
Personal life.
Kitto has a passion for languages, and a fascination with the Far East. This love for the Oriental led Mark to study Chinese at the "School of Oriental and African Studies" (SOAS), and for the second year of his Chinese degree course Mark went to Beijing in 1986. As a student, and presently, he has travelled to most of China’s provinces. Kitto has recently discovered the mountains of southern Zhejiang. In 1993 he was a member of the first expedition to cross the Taklamakan Desert from west to east.
According to Kitto, he first discovered Moganshan during the Lunar New Year in 1999 and returned frequently thereafter.
In 1997 Mark met Joanna, a native of Guangzhou through a mutual friend. They married in 2002. The family now includes two children, Isabel and Tristan. After announcing that he was leaving China month passed with a grand tour of the country being planned. His stated destination is a cottage in the village of Fakenham, a jumping hot spot in North Norfolk.
Professional career.
Mark Kitto was a Captain in the Welsh Guards before he became a metals trader in London and then China in 1996. By 2004, Mark Kitto had set up a foreign joint venture consultancy company, and invested 3m yuan ($350,000) to bring his formula north to the capital by launching "That’s Beijing", with a circulation of 20,000, "That’s Shanghai" (then 45,000) and "That’s Guangzhou" (15,000). There had not been a single cent of investment or finance from outside. The business and the magazines were entirely “self-made,” stated Kitto in article "That's China".
In 2004, after seven years building up a magazine empire in China, Kitto had it seized by the state. Regarding his redundancy, he stated, "I lived in the grey zone that is China’s media business and, despite my commitment to the country, paid a high price." Kitto has been a regular contributor to "Prospect Magazine" for the last six years. In his recent article "You'll never be Chinese" Kitto stated "my state-owned competitors (enemy is more accurate) told me in private that they studied every issue I produced so they could learn from me. They proceeded to do everything in their power to destroy me." He expressed his regrets that he could not quite thrive alongside his Communist competitors, and declared that he would not miss China once he left it for good.
Mark Kitto and his wife also opened a coffee shop and three guest houses in Moganshan Lodge.
He chronicles his time in China and his discovery of Moganshan in his book "China Cuckoo" (in the UK) ISBN 978-1-84529-940-8 or "Chasing China: How I Went to China in Search of a Fortune and Found a Life" (the US edition) ISBN 978-1-60239-657-9.

St Olaf's Church, Poughill

St Olaf's Church is a Grade I listed church in Poughill, Bude, Cornwall. 
The font dates to the 13th century. The south aisle dates to the 14th and 15th centuries. The porch and west tower are dated to the 15th century. The studded door is dated to the 16th century.
The church seats 300 persons and is dedicated to the Norwegian King and so-called Martyr, St Olaf (Olaf II of Norway). At the restoration in 1928 the foundations of the original Norman church were uncovered but nothing of this remains above ground. The pillars on the north side and south arch of the nave are of Caen stone (14th century); those of the south side are granite (15th century). The piscina and aumbry in the south chancel are 13th century. Inside the church is a wall of frescoes. The frescoes date from about 1470, and depict St Christopher: they were discovered in 1894 beneath the whitewash. Such paintings were once common in churches; the Poughill accounts record the washing-out of the figures in 1550 at the time of the Reformation. According to the legend, St Christopher was a heathen giant who, on turning Christian, was instructed by a holy hermit to carry travellers over a dangerous ford, and who, one stormy night carried the child Jesus on his shoulder.

Three hotels already operated by CIWL before 1894 were integrated in the hotel chain. The CIGH had operated successfully for twenty years when World War I heavily effected the hotel business. CIGH had to sell or close many hotels and at the and of World War I only four hotels were operated by CIGH. After World War I the CIGH wasn't regarded as a core business and it wasn't until after World War II that the hotel business was revived.

Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani was an Arab general and governor for the Abbasid Caliphate, active in the second quarter of the 9th century.
Khalid was a member of the Shayban tribe, dominant in the region of Diyar Bakr in the northern Jazira, and third son of Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani, who served twice as Arab governor ("ostikan") of "Arminiya" (a large province encompassing the whole of Transcaucasia). Khalid served in the same office no less than four times: in 813/814, 828–832, briefly in 841 and again under Caliph al-Wathiq (r. 842–845). In his first tenure, he showed himself concilatory towards the native Christian population and the "nakharar" princes, but his second tenure was marked by the brutal suppression of several revolts by local Arab magnates, as well as the harsh treatment of the Christian population. As a result, when his re-appointment to the office was announced in 841, a rebellion broke out, forcing the Abbasid government to recall him immediately. Nevertheless, al-Wathiq assigned "Arminiya" to Khalid. The latter arrived in the province at the head of an army, and crushed any opposition. He died soon after at Dvin, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad. His younger son Haytham ibn Khalid ruled in the family's stronghold of Shirvan, and was the first to claim the title of "Shirvanshah".
In 822, Khalid briefly served as governor of Egypt, in an attempt by Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) to re-establish Abbasid control over the province, which was divided by strife among rival Arab factions. Although supported by the head of the one faction Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi, Khalid was outmanoeuvred by the head of the other, Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari, and was forced to abandon Egypt.

Lisbon Theatre and Film School

The Lisbon Theatre and Film School ("Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema") of the Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon
inherited the function of the National Conservatoire, founded by Almeida Garrett, in 1836, and of teaching Film, introduced in the same establishment since 1971. The main goal of the Lisbon Theatre and Film School is training in the fields of Theatre and Cinema. Sometimes it is still referred to by its former designation "Conservatório Nacional". It is a public institution of higher education created in Lisbon but now located in Amadora, Portugal.
History.
The Lisbon Theatre and Film School was set up in Lisbon by Decree-Law nr. 310/83, dated July 1 (1983). The object of this legal document was to reconvert the National Conservatoire ("Conservatório Nacional"), the establishment of artistic education, and the setting up of several new establishments offering degrees in the same artistic areas as the Conservatório, among which this school, specifically directed at theatre and film education.
Theatre Education had a long tradition in the National Conservatoire: it went back to the date of its creation in 1836, by Decree of Queen Maria II, in the scope of a Plan for the foundation and organisation of a National Theatre proposed by João Baptista de Almeida Garrett, then still called "Conservatório Geral de Arte Dramática" and formed by three Schools: "Escola Dramática ou de Declamação" for drama education, "Escola de Música" for music education (integrating the former "Conservatório de Música", set up in "Casa Pia" by Decree of 1835) and "Escola de Dança, Mímica e Ginástica Especial" for dance, mime arts and especial gymnastics education.
By later reforms, the name of the CNational Conservatoire was changed, first to "Conservatório Real de Lisboa" and then, already under the new republican regime, to "Conservatório Nacional", the name of the "Escola Dramática ou de Declamação" being altered to "Escola de Arte de Representar".
On July 4, 1914, the School of Art of Acting ("Escola de Arte de Representar") was for the first time granted management autonomy.
By Decree dated May 19, 1914, the scenography and setting design degree was set up in this school (to be taught “in the big paintings room of the National Theatre Almeida Garrett which, functioning under the Escola de Arte de Representar”, would exclusively “be at the service andpractices of the corresponding teacher”); by Decree of August 6, 1914, the costume designer degree was also set up.
As for Film Education, the corresponding degree was only set up in National Conservatoire after 1971, on a pedagogic experimental basis, in the scope of the reform process undertaken by Madalena Perdigão, in the time of Minister Veiga Simão.
By that time, the Pilot School for the Formation of Film Professionals ("Escola Piloto para a Formação de Profissionais de Cinema") was created and its first degree initiated in 1973. From the beginning, a deep concern of this school has been to complement the technical knowledge necessary to cinema-linked professions with a more artistic component.
The degree being offered today by the Department of Film of the Lisbon Theatre and Film School has gone through an evolution since 1973 but its philosophy is still the same as that of the first degree which, it should be stressed, was very much of a pioneer in Portuguese public higher education.
By governmental Decree nr. 46/85, of November 22 (1985), the Lisbon Theatre and Film School - that had so far been under the Directorate General of Higher Education ("Direcção-Geral do Ensino Superior") and, since 1983, managed by an Organisation Committee formed by Professors Jorge Synek Listopad, President, and José Bogalheiro, member – was integrated in the Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon (IPL), a public polytechnic higher education establishment created by Decree-Law nr. 513-T/79, of December 26 (1979).
The Lisbon Theatre and Film School became then an organic unit of the Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon, still in a process of internal organisation by the mentioned Committee until the publication of its Statutes in Journal of Laws ("Diário da República"), 2nd series, nr. 15, of January 18, 1995.
When totally new premises were built in Amadora, within the greater Lisbon area, for the Lisbon Theatre and Film School(the first building ever constructed in Portugal specifically to host a public artistic higher education establishment), it was finally possible to move from the old Caetanos' Convent ("Convento dos Caetanos"), in Lisbon, where Almeida Garrett´s "Conservatório Geral de Arte Dramática" had provisionally functioned, to modern premises designed to have adequate teaching rooms, studios, performing areas, library and cafeteria, all of which offer the best working conditions for its students.
The bi-departmental structure of the School, a historical heritage from the previous schools of Theatre and of Film of the National Conservatoire, led to a certain pedagogic-scientific autonomy granted to the two Departments, according to the Statutes.
The Lisbon Theatre and Film School has steadily been asserting itself as a reference school both at national and international level, and it has been integrated in relevant international organisations dealing not only with the specific areas concerned, like the International Theatre Institute (ITI), the CILECT – "Centre International de Liaison des Écoles de Cinema et de Telévision", but also with Arts in general, which is the case of ELIA – European League of Institutes of the Arts.
This international cooperation concern also led to efforts made to strengthen the School´s active participation in teacher and student intercourse programmes, within specific programmes, like the Socrates/Erasmus and the Leonardo da Vinci, as well as bilateral agreements with Universities of Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico).
The objectives of the Lisbon Theatre and Film School, according to its Statutes, are: Training of highly qualified professionals; research activities; artistic experiments and production; launching or participation in development projects; community involvement.
To consistently fulfil these objectives, the School has adjusted its educational provision to the Bologne Process, its two Departments offering first and second level Degrees (Graduation and Master); it set up a Research Centre which is developing projects in partnership with a similar Centre in University of Algarve; it participates in educational development programmes at local level, as for instance the programme for curriculum improvement activities in public basic schools in the Amadora municipality, and annually produces and organises, in its own premises as well as in Theatres, Museums, Cinemas and other public spaces, numbers of performances and exhibitions of its students´ dramatic and cinema practical works, attendance to all events being free to the community.

Suhi Potok

Suhi Potok (; formerly also "Suha vas"; or "Durnbach"; Gottscheerish: "Dürnpoch") is a settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.
Name.
The name "Suhi Potok" literally means 'dry creek'. Toponyms containing the element "potok" 'creek' are common in Slovenia and usually correspond to German names ending in "-bach" 'creek'. The obsolete Slovene name "Suha vas" means 'dry village'. The German name "Dürnbach" also literally means 'dry creek' and may be compared to similar names in Carinthia, such as the hamlet of "Dürnfeld" in the Municipality of Magdalensberg.
History.
Suhi Potok was a Gottschee German village. According to the Kočevje land registry of 1574, the village had four full farms divided into eight half-farms, corresponding to between 45 and 55 inhabitants. In 1770 there were 12 houses in the village. In 1937 the village had 13 houses and a population of 54. During the Second World War most of the village was burned, leaving only two (out of 13) houses and the 18th-century Saint Andrew's Church. After the war, the Kočevje collective farm and forestry company took over management of the village's fields and pastures.
Church.
A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Andrew was built in the village in 1758 based on the plans for the parish church in Mozelj. A previous church stood at the site as early as the 17th century, indicated also by a missal from 1641. The now-abandoned church has a single nave and a bell-gable. Saint Andrew's Church is located on the edge of the village and is registered as cultural heritage. The original structure was mentioned by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in 1689, who stated that it had three altars. After the Second World War, when Suhi Potok was nearly abandoned, the church was used as a barn, after which it started to deteriorate. The originally wooden shingled roof was replaced with a tiled roof in the fall of 2006 to prevent further deterioration of the building.

Reception.
Critical reception.
The album has received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of "Allmusic" was positive with his review, praising her "fine singing voice" and her "songwriting chops". He comments on some of the songs: "Ready or Not" is the best track by far with a very catchy chorus, "Hurricane" has clever fairy tale lyrics and an impassioned vocal (and a sassy rap section), "Blonde" is a little clichéd but ends up as a convincing argument that hair color isn't a gauge of brains, and "Rocks at My Window" is a witty and fun love song with a big beat. Apart from the very moody and vocally powerful "", the ballads aren't particularly memorable, though, and the album is bogged down by similar-sounding arrangements and song structures that don't do Mendler's voice and breezy style any favors. He concluded the album, saying "Still, it's an impressive debut from a singer who shows real talent and has every chance to break out of the Disney mold and do something all her own down the road." Xinhua of "Spin or Bin" rated the album 3 out of 5 stars and praised the "catchy tunes" of the songs and her "surprisingly capable vocals" but concluded: "Honestly, with the industry dominated by Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato and Cher Lloyd at the moment, it’s really going to be quite hard for a breakout artist to pit herself against the pop princesses, even with a pretty solid album like "Hello My Name Is..." but I'm really enjoying the songs on here, and will be on the lookout for Bridgit Mendler in the next year or so. She could just surprise us." Jessica Dawson of "Common Sense Media" gave a positive review of the album and rated it four out of five stars and praised the clean lyrics of the songs. Hailey Sager of "Musiqtone" gave an acclaimed rating of four-and-a-half stars out of five and praised her "vocal range" and the "powerful and lyrics" of the songs. She concluded that "Mendler has an amazing voice" and that she said that the album "is one of my favorite albums of 2012 because it has a lot of relatable material, and it is also an enjoyable album."
However, hiddentrack of "AbsolutePunk" gave a mixed review and rated the album 47% out of 100% and was not sure "whether she wants to be the next Taylor Swift or Cher Lloyd or even Kesha. He also said that the album "really lacks any direction at all." But he did praise the lead single, "Ready or Not", describing it as "catchy" with "a big chorus, handclaps and fluffy lyrics that lack substance, but it works." Sherman Yang of "MSN" also gave a mixed review and gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five praised the songs, "Ready or Not", praising the "catchy chorus" and "Forgot to Laugh", describing the song as "fun and happy tracks that kids can party to but with sadly bimbotic lyrics." He also noticed that after listening to the first two tracks, "the tracks start to sound the same after a while with their seemingly similar melodies and arrangements." He concluded the album, saying "Mendler either needs to find some inspiration to write better songs or cover other artists' works because her songs sound the same after a while. It seems rather likely at this point that the singer might be headed down the path to nowhere."
Chart performance.
The album debuted at number 30 on the US "Billboard" 200 chart and at number 30 on the US "Billboard" Digital Albums chart. According to "Billboard" and Soundscan, the album sold over 12,000 copies in its first week of release. As of September 2013 the album has exceeded over 180,000 copies in the US.

Even without the song being released as a single, the song already received positive reviews, saying that the song "is a shiny, guitar-driven pop-rock anthem, loaded with witty metaphors that would give Taylor Swift a run for her money." and concluded "he sharp songcraft is all the more impressive given that Mendler co-wrote the track herself." According to "MTV", it was produced by Emanuel "Eman" Kiriakou and Evan "Kidd" Bogart, the same people who produced "Ready or Not". Rachel Brodsky of "MTV" was also positive with her review, describing the song as "is at once sunny and wise, and seems to revel in the friendly sass and punch of Cher Lloyd and the fast-talking know-how of Lily Allen".

Romy Gosz

Roman 'Romy' Louis Gosz (August 2, 1910 Grimms, Wisconsin - August 29, 1966, Manitowoc, Wisconsin) was a popular and commercially successful polka musician in the upper Midwest. Gosz's music featured the Bohemian brass style and appealed to the many ethnic groups (Dutch, Bohemian, Belgian, German and Polish) found throughout the region.
History.
Romy Gosz was born on August 2, 1910 in Grimms, Wisconsin to Paul and Anna Gosz, the fourth of their seven children.
At age 7, Gosz would take his first and only piano lesson. When he told his piano teacher he would not be able to make his next lesson because he had a dance job, he was told "not to come back at all if you can play a job with one lesson".
When he was 11, Gosz joined his father Paul and his older brother's, George and Mike, in forming the Paul Gosz Orchestra. Their first job was playing at a silver wedding anniversary in Newton, Wisconsin. The very next night, they played a golden anniversary at the J.D. Prokash hall in Rockwood, Wisconsin and the night after that, the group played a sixtieth wedding anniversary dance.
A few years later, Gosz's father Paul decided to work more at his day job at the local lime kiln, Allwood Lime Company, and he handed the management of the family orchestra over to George. By 1928, leadership of the group had passed to Romy, who was barely eighteen at the time. Still a minor, Gosz was unable to conduct business and manage the band legally, so he retained his father's name for the group. Early on, Gosz determined that his group should focus on the making of records and live performances. He thought that playing over the radio on a regular basis would be detrimental to the band's traveling and the resulting opportunity to interact with their audiences.
On July 5, 1929, Gosz married Miss Antoinette Leggio at St. Ann Catholic Church in Francis Creek, Wisconsin, the same parish where he had attended school as a boy. The couple took up residence in a small home that Gosz and his father built in Rockwood. Over the next seven years, the couple would have five children (four sons and one daughter). In 1948, Gosz purchased a home with an adjacent Tavern and Dance Hall at "Polifka's Corners" (the intersection of Manitowoc County Road T and Polifka Road) near Kellnersville.
Gosz and his orchestra cut their first record in 1930 at the Broadway studio in Grafton, Wisconsin. They recorded an old Bohemian tune called . Gosz commented that they did it "just to see what the band sounded like." The recording of "Pilsen Polka" became a bestseller throughout the decade and was key to building Gosz's popularity.
Later that same year, the band donated its services for the diamond jubilee celebration of St. Mary's Catholic church in Tisch Mills, Wisconsin. When the pastor, Father Rudolph James Hodik, went to Rome the following year for an audience with Pope Pius XI, he presented the pontiff with some of Gosz's recordings. Father Hodik returned home with a papal blessing for Gosz and the band. The papal blessing and a picture of Pope Pius were some of Gosz's proudest possessions and were displayed prominently in the Gosz home.
In 1931 Gosz found himself without a trumpet player. Gosz commented, "I knew where I could get a good pianist, but couldn't find a trumpet player, so I changed from piano to trumpet. I taught myself. In six months we made a recording with me double tonguing on the trumpet."
The Wisconsin American Legion was searching for a musical theme for its 1934 convention, when somebody heard Gosz's "The Prune Song". It was immediately adopted as the convention theme. Originally an old Bohemian waltz called "Sveskova Alej", Gosz increased the song's tempo and added some double tonguing to the trumpet part. This is typical of many of his recordings. Today, the song is known as "We Left Our Wives Back Home"
His recordings "Musical Clock" and "Picnic In The Woods" appeared in early country music charts printed by Billboard Magazine.
By 1940, Gosz's band was very popular with the general Wisconsin audiences. It was around this time that a Sheboygan, Wisconsin radio station polled listeners for their favorite bandleader. In the one-week poll Gosz placed first, with a margin of seven hundred votes over the second place finisher, western bandleader, Gene Autry.
The national press soon took note of Gosz's popularity, with articles appearing in "Billboard", "Coronet", "Life", "Pic", and "Time".
On June 9, 1948, Gosz took part in a battle of the bands at the Milwaukee Arena. Competing against Louis Bashell, Lawrence Duchow, Harold Loeffelmacher and the Six Fat Dutchmen, Whoopee John Wilfahrt, and Frankie Yankovic. At the event's conclusion, the title of "America's Polka King" was awarded to Yankovic.
At their peak, Gosz and his bands were on the road six nights a week, returning home for a noon radio show on Sunday and then playing a park concert, picnic, or festival in the afternoon. The band would perform from 8:00pm to 1:00am, at a pace of up to fourteen songs per hour. At the end of the night, Gosz often played up to five encores. When asked about his schedule, Gosz said, "We're a tough bunch around here. We have to be. We recently played 52 consecutive nights and not one of my men missed a day on his regular job." Gosz spent the majority of his travels in Wisconsin, playing a circuit of towns that included: Batavia, Bonduel, Denmark, Embarrass, Freedom, Jericho, Kimberly, Krok, Luxemburg, Poland, Pulaski, Royalton, Scandinavia, Slovan, Sobieski, Sugar Bush, Symco, Waterloo, and Zachow. Less frequently, Gosz played in Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska and the Dakotas. Gosz handled all of his own bookings, and not being the most attentive businessman, he often double-booked his gigs. Whenever this happened, Gosz would hire a pickup band and play one engagement, and he would send his orchestra to work the other.
Death.
In the latter half of August 1966, Gosz was admitted to Manitowoc Memorial Hospital to undergo gallbladder surgery. During the operation, surgeons determined that they could not complete the surgery because the gall bladder was too badly infected. This resulted in further complications, including the onset of pneumonia. All of this transpired during the week of the Manitowoc County Fair. Gosz's following was so great, it is reported that when his death was announced on August 29 to the fairgoers, the grounds were absolutely silent. The day of his funeral, over twenty-three hundred people filed by his coffin, paying their respects. Sometime after, a fan commented that, "When he lived, the dance floor was filled with happy people. When he died - standing room only. The church was full." Romy Gosz was buried in the church cemetery of the St. Ann Catholic Church in Francis Creek, Wisconsin.
Recognition.
Inducted into the International Polka Hall of Fame by the International Polka Association in 1979.
Inducted into the Wisconsin Polka Hall of Fame in 1998 with a Life Achievement Award.
Recording Catalog.
Romy recorded over 180 tunes during his lifetime for a variety of labels, including Broadway, Brunswick, Columbia, Coral, Decca, King, Mercury, Mono, Okeh, Polkaland, Universal and Vocalion.
Band Names.
Throughout Romy's career, there were quite a few variations in the name of the band.
Former Band Members.
The members of the Gosz bands changed over time as well, with each of the following musicians accompanying Gosz on either a recording session or a live performance.

Jonas wrote the hymn on a request by Martin Luther in 1524. He combined the ideas of Psalm 124 with passages from Psalm 12 and other Biblical motifs. The text was first published in the Erfurt "Enchiridion", a hymnal of 26 songs including 18 by Luther, "Es ist das Heil uns kommen her" and other hymns by Paul Speratus, "" by Elisabeth Cruciger, and others.
Luther himself published his own paraphrase of Psalm 124 in three stanzas, ". The current German Protestant hymnal "" has as EG 297 a combination of Jonas' stanzas 1, 2, 5 and 6, and Luther's 2 and 3 (as 3 and 4).

The Painter and The Buyer

The Painter and The Buyer is a 1565 pen and ink on brown paper painting by German artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The alternative title is The Artist and The Connoisseur.
The painter is thought to be a self-portrait of Pieter Bruegel the Elder.
Content.
The artist holds a paint brush in his right hand, on the left past the viewer, presumably to the object he paints A second man looks over his shoulder at the resulting picture. This work is for the viewer, however, face down. Bruegel is limited entirely to the presentation of two dissimilar men: the painter drawn in detail with disheveled hair, bushy eyebrows and unkempt beard, and the more vague outline reproduced viewer behind him with pince-nez, unsightly nose and mouth slightly open.
Interpretation.
In the Middle Ages, artists were fixed in a craft tradition of the clients such as church, aristocracy or the bourgeoisie was later supported. The representation of artists and buyers and artists and connoisseurs reflects already the new humanistic conception of art that the painter makes the subjective opinion of an expert-dependent. According to Hans East there is a "foolish observer" Quote: ... with stupid open mouth laboriously through the lens of the artist he stares over his shoulder. This is the connoisseur and amateur, as he meets us later in the cycle of Roman antiquarians to Philipp von Stosch.
It is uncertain whether it is for the painter, as is often assumed to be a self-portrait of Bruegel, also conceivable is a portrait of Hieronymus Bosch.

Rampoha

Rampoha (; in older sources also "Drampah", , Gottscheerish: "Dranponk") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Dolenjske Toplice in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Občice.
Name.
The Slovenian name "Rampoha" is derived from the German name "Dranbank", which means 'grassy meadow'. However, the German name may be a Slovene-German compound of "Dran-" (< Sln. "traven" 'grassy') + "Bank, Bang" 'forest meadow'; cf. Germ. "Grasbank" and "Rasenbank" 'grassy ridge of ground'.
History.
Rampoha was a Gottschee German village founded after 1574 (when it does not yet appear in the land registry). A farmer named Pachinger is recorded as living in the settlement in 1750. In 1931 the village had four houses and a population of 27. In 1933 the population was 15. The village economy was largely based on carpentry and selling wood in Straža. The inhabitants were evicted in the fall of 1941. During the Rog Offensive in the summer of 1942, Italian forces burned the village and it was never rebuilt.

88 Elmira St.

88 Elmira St. is a Grammy Award-nominated 1991 album by guitarist Danny Gatton. The album was Gatton's fifth, but his first on a major record label—Elektra. The instrumental album covers a number of genres, including jazz, country, rockabilly, and blues.
Background.
When Gatton signed to Elektra, their only stipulation for his first album on the label was that it should be solely instrumental. On presenting his ideas for the album to the label, they suggested he cut his version of the "Simpsons" theme tune. The manualist flatulence at the end of the recording may have been Gatton's response to the label's suggestion.
The album's title, "88 Elmira St.", is a reference to Gatton's home as a child. Gatton stated that at the time of producing the album, he "was playing Scotty Moore's original guitar [...] It's a Gibson ES-295, and I bought it trashed out twelve years ago. It sounded incredibly good; it had some magic in it, but I didn't know it was Scotty's. Then Billy Hancock kept offering me all kinds of money for it, way more than it should have been worth, so I said, 'What's the deal?' He said, 'I think you've got Scotty Moore's guitar there.'" Similarities to Moore, Al Casey and James Burton can be heard on the album.
Recording.
The album was produced by Gatton, Billy Windsor and Ian Kimmet, mixed by George Cowan and mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk. The album was recorded at Bearsville Studios, New York and Big Mo Studio, Maryland.
Equipment.
On the album, Gatton used a 1990 Fender Telecaster (his signature version with Joe Barden pickups), a Fender acoustic, a Martin D-28-32, a 1954 Gibson ES 295, a Gibson RB800 5 string banjo, a 1950 Fender 6-string lap steel, and a 1958 5-string Fender Precision Bass. For amplification, he used a 1963 Fender Vibrolux, a 1963 Fender Super Reverb, a 1958 Fender Twin, a 1964 Fender Deluxe, and a 1958 Fender Bassman. Shannon Ford used a Drum Workshop kit with Sabian cymbals. John Previti's basses were the 5-string Fender Precision Bass, a Gibson Ripper and an unspecified upright bass. The keyboards—used by Bill Holloman and Tommy Lepson—were a Hammond B3, a Yamaha DX7, and a Roland D50.
Reception.
In a review for AllMusic, Cub Koda wrote that the album was "a whole lot more than just yer average fretboard wanking jam-fest". Koda gave the album a 4.5/5 rating.
The album peaked at 121 in the Billboard 200 chart.
The entire album was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 1992 Grammy Awards, losing to Eric Johnson's "Cliffs of Dover".

German submarine U-235

German submarine "U-235" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The submarine was laid down on 25 February 1942 at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as 'werk' 665, launched on 4 November and commissioned on 19 December under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Goske von Möllendorf.
After training with the 5th U-boat Flotilla at Kiel, "U-235" was transferred to the 22nd flotilla on 29 October 1943, following her sinking in May by US bombs in Kiel. She had been raised, repaired and returned to service. She was reassigned to the 31st U-boat Flotilla on 2 April 1945, less than two weeks before her second sinking.
"U-235" was sunk in error in April 1945 in the Kattegat by a German torpedo boat.
Loss.
"U-235" was heading to Norway with when they encountered a small German convoy accompanied by the torpedo boat "T-17". All vessels had not been warned of the others' presence. But the convoy had been warned that a British submarine was in the area. "U-1272" dived deep and out of trouble, but "U-235" surfaced, possibly to identify herself and then as if changing her mind, also dived. "T-17" attacked, dropping depth charges. Any celebration on "T-17" was abruptly stilled when amongst the wreckage appearing were bodies in "Kriegsmarine" uniform. Forty-six men died; there were no survivors.

FSK Stripy

Futsal Klub Stripy, commonly referred to as FSK Stripy or simply Stripy is an amateur Slovenian futsal club based in Škofja Loka. 
History.
Futsal in Škofja Loka.
In the early 1980s, the boys from village Sveti Duh (near Škofja Loka) and the surrounding area became interested in futsal. They were gathering in front of a village shop in the evenings and discovering the charms of this increasingly popular sport. They have slowly formed a team that started to attend various tournaments and achieved notable results. Due to recognition, they have decided to name the team after cartoon series Stripy.
The establishment of the club.
In 1987, the club was officially registered. After several successful performances, their ambitions grew and they started to attend tournaments outside Gorenjska region. Tournaments in Ljubljana were stronger and of better quality, they learned many things, particularly tactical game ideas. They didn't gave up despite defeats at the beginning (known Gorenjska persistence) and after one year they were just below the top places also at tournaments in Ljubljana. 
In 1993, through the first regional qualification, they qualified for the national championship in Kodeljevo in Ljubljana, where they won an impressive fourth place among the eight teams. In the semifinal meeting they were stopped by at that time "untouchable" players of Ljubljana team Vuko (later national champions), but only after the penalty shootout.
In the next two seasons, 1994 and 1995, they participated in the national championship and won the 5th and 4th place. At the championship in Ljutomer they also came to the semifinals and lost after penalty shootout.
Golden times for futsal in Škofja Loka.
In the 1995–96 season, the championship became a league contest of the top ten teams in Slovenia. This was the most successful season in club history – they finished in the third place.
Black season.
The following season 1996–97 did not finish as planned, and the club was relegated from the Slovenian Futsal League. The club worked on a voluntary basis, older players were already a bit saturated with competitions and travels, and they were not followed by younger players. 
The consequences were thus inevitable − they have decided not to play in the Slovenian Second Futsal League, but rather only in recreational leagues and at tournaments.
Re-registration.
The club was re-founded on 7 February 2007.
Arena.
In spring 2010, they moved into the newly built Trata Sports Hall, where their selections have all training sessions and matches.

<doc id="36559674" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36559674" title="Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka">
Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka

The Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka in Winona, Minnesota, referred to in Polish as "Bazylika Świętego Stanisława Kostki", is a historic church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Winona, and a prominent fixture upon the city of Winona's skyline. Within the diocese, it is better known as Saint Stan's. It is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and was designated as a Minor Basilica of the Roman Catholic Church on November 10, 2011 by Pope Benedict XVI.
History of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish.
The congregation dates back to April 2, 1871, when leaders of Winona's Kaszubian Polish community formally declared its intent to organize a parish under the patronage of St. Stanislaus Kostka. Prior to this they had been attending Mass at either the "Irish" (Saint Thomas) or the "German" (Saint Joseph) Catholic church, but they wished to worship in their own language and to be led by a Kashubian or Polish pastor. Accordingly, a small wooden sanctuary was constructed at the corner of Fourth and Carimona in 1872. 
From its very beginning, the new Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish served as the religious and the civic center for Winona's Kaszubian Poles. The first permanent pastor was the Reverend Joseph Juskiewicz, who was succeeded in January 1875 by the Reverend Alexander Michnowski. In 1875 the Reverend Jan Romuald Byzewski (1842-1905), a Kaszubian-born Franciscan forced to emigrate from German Poland due to the Kulturkampf, arrived and served as pastor until 1890.
Winona grew rapidly during the 1880s and 1890s, and the continuation of the Kaszubian diaspora played a major part of this population boom. By 1893, Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish had completely outgrown its old sanctuary. Creation of a satellite Polish parish on Winona's West End was considered; indeed, such a parish, Saint Casimir, would be established in 1906. But as a matter of religious and civic pride, the parishioners of Saint Stanislaus Kostka decided to build a larger, grander 1800-seat structure on the site of their present church.
The Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka.
The Basilica's interior has undergone many changes over time. It is adorned with beautiful stained glass windows dedicated to various saints and devotions particularly cherished by Kaszubian Poles, with inscriptions in Polish. On Thanksgiving Day, 1920, the parish celebrated the Basilica's dedication by consecrating a massive marble altar with a canopy supported by four massive marble pillars. New sanctuary furniture, new confessionals, and a pipe organ were installed by Reverend Pacholski's successor as pastor, the Reverend Jozef Cieminski (a parishioner in his youth), along with landscaping of the entire church property. Some of the Basilica's original furnishings, along with many contemporary furnishings preserved from other diocese churches, can be viewed at the Polish Museum at Second and Liberty Streets.
At 7:40 pm on Sunday, June 5, 1966, lightning from a severe electrical storm struck the Basilica's dome. According to the parish's Centennial History, the dome turned bright red when the lightning bolt struck and flames burst out the windows from the wooden framework inside. After costly and expensive repairs were performed, the Basilica was re-opened on Sunday, December 11, 1966. The Basilica's exterior was once more washed and renovated in preparation for the parish's centennial anniversary celebration on May 15–16, 1971. In 1991-1992 another extensive renovation project resulted in the main dome and towers being covered in metal. The current seating capacity is now 1085 people, due to numerous renovations over the years.
Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish School.
Founded in the early 1880s by Reverend Byzewski, the first Saint Stanislaus Kostka School was a one-room frame building. Classes were taught by the first parish organist, Dominik Hamerski. The school was gradually expanded to six rooms and on September 5, 1887 it was placed in the charge of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. A substantial brick convent was built for the Sisters soon afterward, to the east of the Basilica. By 1903 almost 700 students were enrolled in grades one through six, necessitating a new school to be built immediately south of the Basilica, which was completed in 1905. In 1966, this school building was demolished and a modern school building built in its place. This modern school building continues to serve Saint Stanislaus Elementary School to this day.

God Is Saying This to You...

God Is Saying This to You... is the second studio album by American lo-fi indie rock musician Kurt Vile, released in April 2009 on Mexican Summer records as a limited vinyl release. A repress of 1000 copies was released in 2010. 
Similar to Vile's previous album, "Constant Hitmaker" (2008), the album is a compilation of home recordings recorded between 2003 and 2008. The album predominately features material recorded prior to "Constant Hitmaker", with Vile noting, "I put on really early songs, like from my first CD-R. I put them on there along with songs I had just recorded."
Background and recording.
Recorded between 2003 and 2008, "God Is Saying This to You..." is composed primarily of tracks previously self-released by Vile on CD-R. Regarding his former distribution method, Vile noted, "I was putting out CD-Rs as I went along and I wouldn’t always be recording. Just because I was putting out these CD-Rs didn’t mean it was all my new material. I’d just go through my best stuff. I feel like I’ve always done it where one song could be from two years ago, one is from right now, one is from five years ago, and I compile them in that way. Like a mixtape or something. I was always serious about it. It’s not much different now except that by the time of "Constant Hitmaker" (2008) — I found somebody to put that out — I just had all these recordings."
Lyrics from the song, "Red Apples", subsequently appear on the track, "Runners Up", from, Vile's 2011 album, "Smoke Ring for My Halo". Vile noted that the original track "was written when I only had a couple of lines I thought were good - my brother and I kind of jammed that song out together, to be honest. It was a sketch, but it just had a lot of vibe to it. This was before I had anything out yet, so it didn't matter what was where. I would switch lines out to see where they worked. I loved that stuff in The Fall; Mark E. Smith had all these recurring characters, like the Hip Priest, in his lyrics. He would come up different narrative concepts and recurring themes. You definitely hear bootlegs of Bob Dylan or Springsteen where, you know, you hear a variation of a lyric that ended up in another song. [...] "Beach On the Moon" intentionally uses lyrics from a bunch of my songs, which is why it's also called "(Recycled Lyrics)."

Propionitrile

Propionitrile, also known as ethyl cyanide and propanenitrile, is an organic compound with the formula CH3CH2CN. It is a simple aliphatic nitrile. The compound is a colourless, water-soluble liquid. It is used as a solvent and a precursor to other organic compounds.
Production.
The main industrial route to this nitrile is the hydrogenation of acrylonitrile. It is also prepared by the ammoxidation of propanol (propionaldehyde can also be used instead):
Propionitrile is a byproduct of the electrodimerisation of acrylonitrile to adiponitrile.
In the laboratory propanenitrile can also be produced by the dehydration of propionamide, by catalytic reduction of acrylonitrile, or by distilling ethyl sulfate and potassium cyanide.
Applications.
Propionitrile is a solvent similar to acetonitrile but with a slightly higher boiling point. It is a precursor to propylamines by hydrogenation. It is a C-3 building block in the preparation of the drug flopropione by the Houben-Hoesch reaction.
Safety.
Propanenitrile is poisonous but weakly with an LD50 of 230 mg/kg (rats, oral). Propanenitrile has been determined to be teratogenic due to the metabolic release of cyanide.
In 1979, the Kalama (Vega) plant in Beaufort, South Carolina experienced an explosion during the production of propanenitrile by nickel-catalyzed reduction of acrylonitrile. This site is now one of the two Superfund cleanup sites in South Carolina.

Plot.
A woman gets ready to leave for a get together and finds her husband dead in their room. In no time, she is also tried to kill by a black masked face man. His attempt gets failed and he escapes. The woman is now in state of shock and mentally paralysed. A murder case is registered and investigation take place. Susi (Kanchana) a young college girl comes to her home for vacation along with her friends. She lives with younger paternal uncles Kamalanathan and Vimalanathan who are the younger brothers of the victim and her aunt who was supposed to be the victim in the hands of the murderer. Susi meets Baskar (Ravichandran), a singer and both of them are attracted to each other at first sight.
Series of murders take place at Susi's house with every time a smoking cigar bit being left by the murder intentionally. Police suspect visiting doctor, an old Siddha doctor who is like a brother to Kamalanathan's family, butler etc. Since Susi's aunt is the only eye witness of the murderer her life is in danger. In spite of tight protection she is killed by the murderer. The murderer frequently calls Susi and threatens that her time is up and he is nearing her to kill her. Susi is very frustrated by the incidents at her home and the threatening phone call. Baskar hears her problem and promises to help her. Baskar start his investigation from Vimalanathan who is a drunkard. Then he follows Kamalnathan when he does something suspicious. Baskar follows him to a house which look like a haunted house and a woman who wanders like a ghost. She is actually lover of Kamalanathan who is rescued some years back by him when she tried to commit suicide. Kamalnathan keeps quiet as he wants Susi to get married first and then only marry his lover. Baskar sends everybody out of Susi's house for a night and waits for anything to happen. As expected black masked man comes to Susi's room to kill Susi. Baskar and the masked murderer fight and Baskar tries to uncover his face. In the attempt Baskar manages to grab the mask of the man and see the eyes alone of the man. The murderer escapes from him. After a while Baskar opens the main door of the house only to find Vimalanathan dead at the doorsteps.
Kamalanathan and Susi plan to vacate the house after celebrating the birthday party of Susi. On the day of the party a gunshot sound is heard and Susi's birthday cake is shot on the missed target by masked man. Baskar chases the masked man but could not find him. He sees the old siddha doctor injured at a place who tells him that masked man attacked him and ran away. Everybody at the home does not know why the murders are happening and who kills every member of their family. Siddha doctor urges Kamalnathan to tell about his family which might help to find out who is the murderer. Kamalnathan tells that his father had an illegal affair with a woman and they had a son. But they are all dead in a fire accident fifteen years back. Actually Kamalnathan's elder brother (who is first killed by the murderer) had set fire to kill the woman and her ten-year-old son. Baskar doubts what if the son had not died in the fire and turned out to be the murderer killing the members of the family to seek revenge. Also Baskar screams that he found who is the murderer as he can remember the eyes which is like fire which can kill as many as possible. He has seen the 'Same Eyes' in that house itself and seeing the 'Same Eyes' each and every second. He comes to a conclusion that the murderer is present in the hall where all are gathered. Hence he places the black mask in face of all men in the hall like family doctor, Kamalnathan and the old Siddha doctor to verify whose eyes matches with the eyes he had seen.
Who is the murderer among them? Is Baskar's assumption about the murderer's motivation is correct forms the climax of the story.

Albert Ndongmo

Albert Ndongmo (26 September 1926 – 29 May 1992) was Bishop of Nkongsamba in Cameroon between June 1964 and January 1973.
In 1971 he was arrested, accused of treasonous dealings with rebels, and sentenced to death by a military tribunal. 
His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, of which he served five years before the President ordered his release.
After being released he moved to Rome and then to Canada, where he spent the rest of his life.
Early career.
Albert Ndongmo was born on 26 September 1926 in Bafou, French Cameroons, near Dschang, to a Christian family of Bamiléké people.
On 19 September 1940 he entered the small seminary at Melong, against the wishes of his parents.
In January 1947 he was admitted to the large seminary at Mvolyé.
A year later Castor Osendé Afana came to the Mvolyé seminary, and the two became close friends.
Ndongmo was ordained on 21 December 1955 at Nkongsamba.
He was appointed chaplain of the Nkongsamba diocese in 1959.
On 15 March 1960, Ndongmo launched the journal "L'Essor des jeunes" to impart Christian values to young people.
With this journal, Ndongmo wanted to provide a forum for open debate of contemporary problems.
He saw freedom of expression as the cornerstone of an integrated system of political, social, personal and intellectual belief, and attempted to use the journal for this purpose, although he was forced to work within a very limited budget.
The journal was stamped with Ndongmo's personality. 
He used it, and his "ecclesiastical immunity" to ignore the censors and criticize the regime.
After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) rebels who had been fighting the French colonial government continued to fight the government of President Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom they considered to be a puppet of the French.
Ahidjo had asked the French to lend troops to keep the peace during and after the transition to democracy. Led by General Max Briand, who had served previously in Algeria and Indochina, these troops conducted a brutal "cleansing" campaign in the Bamiléké territory of the West, Centre and Littoral provinces. By some reports, over a quarter of a million people died.
The rebel leader Ernest Ouandié, a Bamiléké like Ndongmo, refused to recognise Ahidjo and continued guerilla warfare.
The diocese of Nkongsamba was in the main combat zone.
Bishop of Nkongsamba.
Ndongmo was named Bishop of Nkongsamba on 16 June 1964, was ordained bishop on 16 August that year and was enthroned the same day by Archbishop Jean Zoa.
He succeeded Paul Bouque in this position.
He was the first local bishop of Nkongsamba, which at that time included the whole Bamiléké area.
In the later part of 1965 he attended the third and fourth sessions of the fourth period of the Second Vatican Council in Rome.
He made an oral intervention on "the ministry and sacerdotal life of priests" on 16 October 1965.
The intervention was incomplete, since his was the sixteenth and last of the session and he did not have time to conclude it.
Cardinal Lercaro, moderating the session, politely invited him to submit his observations to the Secretariat in writing.
He submitted a written intervention on "Christological, ecclesiological and anthropological foundations of the missionary activity of the Church".
Ndongmo was thought to have personal political ambitions, perhaps even aspiring to the presidency.
He understood and to some extent agreed with the UPC since he too was opposed to the dictatorial regime, 
although he did not support the revolutionary guerrilla movement.
He sympathized with the Bamiléké insurgents but accepted that the region need peace in order to develop economically.
It was reported that he visited Algers from May to June 1968 to ask for funds for the UPC from the Algerian government.
Such a trip could not have been reconciled with his pastoral duties.
He may have served as a postbox, passing communications between the local and exiled branches of the UPC.
His statements on political subjects earned him the hostility of others in the church as well as of the government.
According to Ndongmo, in 1965 President Ahidjo asked him to try to mediate with Ernest Ouandié, now the last active rebel leader, to try to end the fighting.
In the following years Ndongmo had a series of meetings with the rebels.
In July or August 1970 Ouandié called for help, and Ndongmo picked him up in his car and took him to his own house, where he let him stay for several nights.
Ndongmo claimed that his actions were consistent with President Ahidjo's instructions. 
Possibly, Ndongmo was being used as bait to capture Ouandié.
Charges and imprisonment.
On 11 August 1970 Ndongmo wrote to "Le Monde" to contradict a false accusation that a stock of arms had been found at the "Mungo Plastique" company, of which he was the manager, and to state that two European technical advisors at that company had been expelled only because their papers were not in order.
The prime minister of East Cameroon, Simon Pierre Tchoungui, asked the Pope to summon Ndongmo to Rome and to then invite him to remain there. 
Ahidjo and Archbishop Jean Zoa were apparently behind the request, wanting to get Ndongmo out of the way.
In Rome, Ndongmo was questioned about his ownership of the plastics factory in Douala.
Ndongmo explained he had set up the factory only to give the diocese financial independence, so it did not have to rely on Western aid.
The Holy See was against this and other enterprises with which Ndongmo had hoped to fund the diocese, schools and hospitals and to create a retirement fund for priests and old people. 
He was reprimanded by the Vatican for his economic and political activity.
Before leaving for Rome, Ndongmo sent Ouandié to take refuge with his catechist on the outskirts of Mbanga.
The catechist refused to accept Ouandié, and alerted the police.
Ouandié went on the run, but was in unfamiliar territory and was hunted by the local people as well as the police.
Eventually, tired, thirsty and hungry, he gave himself up.
Two days after Ouandié's arrest, on 21 August 1970 the Minister of Justice, Félix Sabal Lecco, announced that the security services had discovered a plot to assassinate the head of state by Ouandie in which Ndongmo was complicit.
It was clear that the authorities planned to convict Ndongmo in his absence. 
He managed to convince the Vatican officials to let him return to defend himself.
On Ndongmo's return to Cameroon on 27 August 1970, he found from a newspaper headline that he had been suspended from his position by Rome. 
Pope Paul VI had named Georges Siyam Siewe as apostolic administrator ""Sede Plena"" for Nkongsamba, taking over all active duties. although Ndongmo remained bishop.
Ndongmo went at once to visit the Bishop of Douala. A car was sent to arrest him there and take him to the military prison in Yaoundé.
Ndongmo was placed in a cell of his own, separated from the other prisoners.
His legs and arms were chained, although the handcuffs were removed after a protest by his lawyer.
He and Ouandié were otherwise not mistreated, were given normal food, and often had a glass of wine with their meal.
A doctor checked their condition frequently.
He and the other accused were interrogated by Jean Fochivé, director of the regime's SEDOC political police force, over the next five months.
Ouandié was tried in December 1970 and condemned to death. 
Ndongmo was tried by a military tribunal that opened on 5 January 1971.
He and two others were found guilty and sentenced to death, but on 14 January 1971 his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
Ouandié was executed by firing squad on 15 January 1971 at Bafoussam.
Ndongmo was sent to a prison camp in Tcholliré. 
He resigned from his position as Bishop on 29 January 1973.
The Pope named Thomas Nkuissi to succeed Ndongmo as acting bishop of Nkongsamba.
The church and the state had established an uneasy truce that was severely damaged by the "Ndongmo affair".
Ndongmo's arrest, trial and imprisonment engendered ongoing hostility from the church towards the Cameroon state and created intense controversy within the church.
Some Catholics condemned Archbishop Zoa for being too close to the government, and for possibly assisting in removal of a popular rival.
The affair also caused tension between Muslims and Christians: several churches were burned in the North.
Later career.
President Ahidjo ordered Ndongmo's release in 1975 shortly before a presidential "election".
Under an agreement between Ahidjo and the Vatican, Ndongmo had to leave Cameroon for Rome.
Later he moved to Canada, where he was given citizenship and lived out the rest of his life.
An acquaintance met him at Université Laval in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
He was in good spirits, working on his prison writings and planning to take a course at the university.
He described how he had passed the time while imprisoned by gardening and "writing without paper."
Ahidjo resigned the Presidency in November 1982 and in February 1984 a Cameroon military tribunal sentenced him to death in absentia.
Ndongmo visited Cameroon twice after this, once when Pope John Paul II visited the country in August 1985, and again in 1989 when he was invited to work on the episcopal council of Central African bishops at Yaounde.
Albert Ndongmo died on 29 May 1992 in Quebec.
His body was returned to Cameroon and was buried in the run-down cathedral at Nkongsamba in an elaborate ceremony.

I Love It (Icona Pop song)

"I Love It" is a song by Swedish synthpop duo Icona Pop featuring British recording artist Charli XCX. It was released in May 2012 as a digital download in Sweden, where it peaked at number two on the singles chart. The song was added to their debut studio album "Icona Pop", as well as their EP "Iconic" and their debut international album "This Is... Icona Pop".
The song received positive reviews from music critics, and publications "Rolling Stone" and Pitchfork included it on their year-end lists for 2012. The song went on to become Icona Pop and Charli XCX's first US hit, peaking at number seven on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, denoting over 2 million copies sold in the United States. In July 2013, over a year after it was released elsewhere, the song charted at #1 on the UK Singles chart. It has gone on to sell 2.6 million downloads.
Background.
The song was originally written by Charli XCX, whom Icona Pop met several times in London. Swedish producer Patrik Berger sent Charli two beats, and she quickly wrote songs for each of them, one of which became "I Love It" and the other of which became her following single "You're the One". However, she later stated that she knew she would not end up releasing it herself because she could not reconcile it with her sound.
While recording "Good for You" with Icona Pop, Berger presented them with Charli's work on "I Love It". Band member Aino Jawo said she felt a connection to the song because it mirrored her own experiences, and the line "You're from the 70s but I'm a 90s bitch" reminded her of an older man she had known. Member Caroline Hjelt described Charli XCX's original demo as "more cute, in a way…really cool and cocky". Icona Pop approached Swedish producer Style of Eye to make a rougher version of the track, telling him, "We want the punkiness. We want the 'fuck it' feeling."
Composition.
"I Love It" is set in common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is written in D♭ major, with an authentic cadence for the main chord progression. "Billboard" critic Jessica Hopper defined the instrumental by its "swells of revving synths" and prominent sub-bass sounds. Pitchfork writer Lindsay Zoladz commented that the song was "basically just two-and-a-half minutes of drop"; colleague Larry Fitzmaurice noted the track's maximalist approach fit the contemporary trends in electronic and pop music.
The song's lyrics describe breaking up with an older boyfriend. In its chorus, Icona Pop and Charli XCX shout in unison "I don't care / I love it". Critics compared the song's breakup narrative to Kelly Clarkson's 2004 single "Since U Been Gone", and journalist Chuck Eddy wrote in a piece for "Spin" that the track's brattiness was similar to British band Shampoo.
Release and promotion.
"I Love It" was released in Sweden in May 2012. It entered the Swedish Singles Chart the following month at number 48, and after two months on the chart, the song peaked at number two for three consecutive weeks. After its January 2013 appearance on an episode of "Girls", the song performed better in digital downloads than it had upon initial release. Ten days later it entered the "Billboard" Hot 100, eventually climbing to number seven on the chart. Jawo and Hjelt's first performance with Charli XCX happened in April 2013, after seeing her back stage at a South by Southwest showcase where both acts were playing.
In June 2013, several cover versions of the song entered the UK Singles Chart, including one by vlogger Venus Palermo. When Icona Pop released their version, it entered at the top of the chart, overtaking Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams.
Critical reception.
"I Love It" was met with positive reviews from music critics. The song placed fifteenth on "The Village Voice"s 2012 Pazz & Jop list, and it rose to eighth place the following year. Pitchfork Media labeled it "Best New Music", calling the song "delectable, empowering, infinitely repeatable". Pitchfork later listed the song number 50 on its "Top 100 Tracks of 2012" list. "Rolling Stone" placed "I Love It" at number 35 on its year-end list, naming it "the Euro-slut club jam of the summer". Amrit Singh for Stereogum described it as "fun", Heather Phares commented Jawo and Hjelt "half-sung, half-shouted vocals and revved-up synths make the song inescapably catchy".
Music video.
The music video for "I Love It" was directed by Fredrik Etoall. The video was shot in a day by friends of the band while they were in Paris. It shows Jawo and Hjelt playing a show for a crowd shouting the lyrics and dancing, with additional shots from backstage and an after-party. It also includes outdoor shots of them wearing fringed jackets that they made.
Usage in media.
Following its 2012 release, "I Love It" gained media attention in the United States on the soundtrack for racing video game "" and as the theme song for the MTV "Jersey Shore" spinoff "Snooki & JWoww". Jawo and Hjelt were approached about using "I Love It" in the American series "Girls", which they had watched while living in London. The song features in the January 2013 episode "Bad Friends", in a scene where main character Hannah Horvath dances in a nightclub after taking cocaine.
The song was used in March 2013 episode "Bring It On" of the CW show "The Vampire Diaries", and it appeared in the 2013 film "". The song was heard in the trailers for the 2012 movie "Fun Size" and the 2013 movie "The Heat" starring Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock. It is also the theme tune and title track to TVI's Portuguese teen soap "I Love It". The song is also featured in commercials for the Samsung Galaxy S4 and ecommerce site ShoeDazzle.
The characters of "Glee" covered "I Love It" for the fourth season finale "All or Nothing". In July 2013 American rock band Titus Andronicus posted an eight-minute cover with added lyrics. The same month, American singer Robin Thicke performed a stripped down cover version during a performance on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. On 5 August 2013, the Sesame Workshop released a parody called "Me Want It (But Me Wait)", in which Cookie Monster struggles with self-control around cookies.
Cover versions.
In the absence of the original, many cover versions have charted in the UK. Some versions have even charted after the original had charted.

Gradient oven tester

A gradient oven tester is a testing instrument which simulates the conditions of a production oven in the lab. It is used to test the baking and drying properties of liquid/powder coatings, resins, plastics, etc. and can determine how these materials will react when placed under extreme stress from heat, but more importantly can determine the temperature needed for drying as well as how long it will take for these materials to dry and harden once applied. The usage of the oven guarantees that these things are known prior to production which aids product consistency.
The gradient oven tester has a heating bank which has 45 heating elements each of which contain a Pt-100 temperature probe. Each element is individually insulated which allows for the setting of different temperatures in two adjoining elements.

Reuben Kolb

Reuben Francis Kolb (1839–1918) was an Alabama politician. Kolb ran unsuccessfully for governor of Alabama thrice, in 1890, 1892 and 1894, first as a Democrat and then as a Populist. He also served as the state's commissioner of agriculture twice, in 1887 and between 1910-1914.
Kolb was born in Eufaula, Barbour County. He fought in the American Civil War, commanding a Confederate artillery unit. His uncle was the Alabama governor John Gill Shorter. Kolb was active in the Farmer's Alliance.
While a Democrat, Kolb generally opposed the policies of the Redeemers (conservative Southern Democrats), and styled himself as a Jeffersonian Democrat. Unlike the Redeemers, who sought to disenfranchise black voters, Kolb usually supported their political rights, at least initially. However, Kolb ended up supporting the Alabama Constitution of 1901 which took away the vote from blacks, as well as many poor whites.
The elections he lost in 1892 and 1894 (to Thomas Goode Jones and William C. Oates, respectively) are considered to have been some of the most corrupt in Alabama's history, with widespread vote tampering and fraud.

Liverpool Overhead Railway electric units

The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened on 6 March 1893 with 2-car electric multiple units, the first to operate in the world. Each lightweight car had a motor that took power from a third rail. In 1902 these were replaced with two motors, which reduced the travel time. After 1945 some trains were modernised, replacing the timber body with aluminium and plywood and fitting power operated sliding doors under control of the guard. The trains were all removed from service when the railway closed in 1956. An original example was retained by the Museum of Liverpool and an example of a modernised carriage is stored at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire.
Service.
The Liverpool Overhead Railway was an elevated railway operating in and around the dockside of Liverpool that opened on 6 March 1893 with the first electric multiple units operating in the world. The railway opened with 15 two-car trains, built by Brown, Marshall & Co, each lightweight car with a motor and long, wide with seating for 41 in second class and 16 in first. Power was provided by a third rail between the tracks and air brakes were fitted, the pressure topped up at terminus stations. In the early days a single motor coach would run off-peak.
A further 4 two-car trains were built in 1894, these were only long, followed by enough motor cars and trailers were built in 1896 to allow 15 two-car trains and 8 three-car trains to be formed. These newer motor cars were fitted with motors. To meet competition from the electric tramways that offered a faster service, in 1902 the motor cars were fitted with two Dick, Kerr & Co. motors, which reduced the travel time from end to end from 32 minutes to 20 minutes. At the same time, ten motor cars were widened to to increase accommodation.
Originally first and second class accommodation was provided, but after the L&YR began running over the railway in 1905 this become first and third. The conductor rail was moved from the central position to outside the running rails at the same time. The two-car trains were lengthened to three-car with additional trailers built in 1916–18. The cars were now arranged with transverse seating, the unpowered central coach was fitted with leather-covered seats for first class passengers; third class passengers had wooden seating. The motors were replaced in 1919 by motors, and the travel time increased to 31 minutes.
In 1945–47 a three car train was modernised, replacing the timber body with aluminium and plywood and fitting power operated sliding doors under control of the guard. New trains were considered too expensive so six more trains were rebuilt. The trains were all removed from service when the railway closed in 1956. An original example was retained by the Museum of Liverpool and an example of a modernised carriage is stored at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire.

Ontario Place

"For the theme park, from which this Crown land received its name, Ontario Place (1971-2011)."
Ontario Place is a multiple use site under development in Toronto, Ontario, and owned by the Crown in Right of Ontario, and administered as an agency of the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Culture. It takes its name from the original Ontario Place, a theme park that operated on the site from 1971 to 2011. Currently the site includes the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre, event facility "Atlantis", and a marina. Buildings on the site include "pods" designed by Eb Zeidler and a geodesic dome, previously an IMAX theatre called Cinesphere.
Located on the shore of Lake Ontario, just south of Exhibition Place, it is approximately 4 km west of Downtown Toronto. It opened on May 22, 1971 and consists of three artificially constructed, landscaped islands.
Redevelopment.
2010 request for information.
In the summer of 2010, the provincial government issued a Request for Information calling for ideas from private bidders to completely redevelop the park. Ontario Place general manager Tim Casey told the "Toronto Star" that "2011 will be our 40th anniversary. It definitely needs a revitalization, that’s no surprise. It’s a blank slate, we’re open to just about anything.” A formal Request for Proposals process began that fall. The government intends to transform the park from a largely seasonal facility to a year-round attraction. Redevelopment may include tearing down the Cinesphere as well as other long standing attractions.
2010 and 2011 changes.
From the fall of 2010 through to the fall of 2011, Ontario Place embarked upon an aggressive period of remediation and renewal. Over $10,000,000 in provincial capital funds were spent on the property during this 12-month period. These investments were directed toward:
The general cleanliness of the park was also upgraded significantly and included the planting of over 500,000 seeds, flowers, and trees, the building of new planters, the repainting of nearly every building on the site, and the removal of over 1,000 feet of obsolete and unsightly fencing.
Over and above these capital and cleanliness projects, Ontario Place also made significant investments in entertainment, marketing and sponsorship for its 40th anniversary celebrations. Free grounds admission was offered to the public for the first time in 20 years. Live entertainment performances were quadrupled, to over 2,000. Advertising was reinstated, with a new ad campaign developed by Draft FCB of Toronto. And a significant sponsorship of the 40th birthday celebration by CTV generated over $1,500,000 in extra advertising value. Ontario Place was recognized in 2011 by IAAPA as a worldwide finalist for a Brass Ring Award in the category of Best Integrated Marketing Campaign.
The results of this considerable and broad-based effort generated a significant, measurable, and immediate turnaround in the attendance numbers, park revenues, and public perceptions of Ontario Place in 2011. Total park attendance increased 9% to 880,001 despite a below average year for concerts at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre and a decline in cross-over attendance from the Canadian National Exhibition. Core park attendance, however, increased 72% to 563,362. First-time visitor attendance increased even more, at 89%.Revenues in all categories increased by double digit figures, despite the fact that there was no charge for actual admission to the grounds.
Scores from interview-based research into visitor perceptions also improved strongly. Favourable response to the question, “ Ontario Place has changed for the better”, increased by 43%, as did, “Ontario Place is my favourite entertainment park in the GTA”, at 50% up. Perceptions of park cleanliness and general upkeep improved, by 34% and 37%, respectively.
2012 closure.
On February 1, 2012, the government announced that the public sections of the park will be closed and redeveloped, with a targeted completion date of 2017, in time for Canada's 150th anniversary. John Tory was announced as the chair of a Minister's Advisory Panel on Revitalization. All Ontario Place facilities will be closed except for the marina, the Molson Amphitheatre, the Atlantis entertainment venue and parking.

Gaston Thomas Thornicroft was a leader of the Coloured (mixed-race) community in Southern Rhodesia from the 1930s to the 1960s. His father was Harry Scott Thornicroft, a British colonial administrator, who married a native African woman. Gaston was president of two groups advocating rights for Coloureds: the Coloured Community Service League from 1933, and the Rhodesia National Association from 1952 till it was eclipsed in the early 1960s by more radical black unity groups. He led talks to unite competing Coloured representative associations. Initially he emphasised the Coloured community's separateness from and superiority to black Africans; but later was sympathetic to the non-white unity movement, without ever formally joining it. He was a businessman, running 18 stores by 1945. In the 1953 general election in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, one seat was reserved for a European representing African interests; Thornicroft applied to stand but was refused as not being European. He represented "Coloured & Eurafrican Communities" at the 1961 Southern Rhodesia constitutional talks. He ran unsuccessfully in the 1962 and 1970 general elections in (Southern) Rhodesia.

De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex

The De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex (DLSU-STC) is a satellite campus of De La Salle University (DLSU) located in Biñan City, Laguna, Philippines. The 55-hectare campus was built on land donated by the family of the late National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin. It was originally known as De La Salle Canlubang (DLSC), a district school of De La Salle Philippines that provided science and technology-based primary, secondary, and tertiary education. In 2012, the administrations of DLSU and DLSC approved the integration of DLSC to DLSU, becoming the DLSU Science and Technology Complex.
Campus.
Milagros R. del Rosario Building.
The first building to be constructed on campus is the four-storey Milagros V. del Rosario Building, which houses the school's administrative offices and classrooms. The building was donated to the school by Ambassador Ramon V. del Rosario. The building has 35 classrooms, a 200-seat auditorium, three audio-visual rooms, three libraries, a media lab, a dark room for the photography students, a radio station, a children's playroom, a robotics classroom, and three computer laboratories. Construction began in April 2002 and was completed in June 2003 and was designed by the firm L.V. Locsin and Partners.
Integrated School Building.
Beginning construction on August 2005, the Integrated School building finished right on time for the next school year on March 2006. The IS Building houses the classrooms and other spaces for the Nursery to Grade 3 students of the Integrated School. The building also houses a canteen of its own and it stands beside the Pergola.
Pergola.
The Pergola is a multi-purpose hall for the students. It stands beside the new Integrated School Building. The covered area acts as a special venue with several functions for the different activities of the Academic Community.
History.
The Brothers of the Christian Schools, officially known as "Fratres Scholarum Christianarum" or FSC, is a congregation dedicated to the teachings espoused by St. John Baptist De La Salle.
The first De La Salle School in the Philippines was opened on June 16, 1911 along General Luna, Paco, Manila at the request of the Archbishop of Manila. In 1921, the school was moved to its present site on Taft Avenue. Unable to accommodate requests for admission to the elementary grades, they had to revert an earlier policy not to expand. To date, they have spread out to different provinces. The Brothers have since opened in Greenhills, Antipolo, Lipa, Bacolod, Ilagan, Dasmarinas, and Alabang. They have also undertaken supervision of some schools in Manila, Cavite, Bataan, Cebu, Bukidnon, Surigao del Sur, Negros Occidental, Masbate, Capiz, and Ozamis. Today they are known as De La Salle Supervised Schools.
Around 1977, the idea of having another La Salle School, this time in the Laguna area was conceptualized. This was when Architect Lindy Locsin, then a member of the DLSU board of Trustees, offered to donate several hectares of his family's land to La Salle. In 1997, this generous donation of the Locsins was realized. La Salle Purchased additional contiguous hectares making De La Salle Canlubang a sprawling fifty hectare campus.
Laguna is fast becoming the country's industrial and technological site. Its large, industrial companies presently make it the home of the first Science Technological Park. De La Salle Canlubang was established in June 2003.
The Integrated school opened its doors to 240 students from preschool to grade 4 and grade 8 (second year high school) during its first year. The curriculum adapts to the science education as its basis. 
De La Salle University recently launched its new campus, the De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex (DLSU-STC) Leandro V. Locsin Campus.
DLSU Centennial President and Chancellor Br. Narciso Erguiza Jr. said the DLSU-STC would attract a big number of top students and outstanding faculty to transform the university into a leading research center in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
Course Offerings.
The following degree programs are offered in the STC Campus. These courses are managed and organized by their respective departments and college counterparts based in the Manila Campus:

Braidhurst High School

Braidhurst High School is a non-denominational secondary school located in the Forgewood suburb of Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The school roll is estimated at around 600 pupils. The current rector of the school is Derreck Hannan.
History.
Braidhurst High School was established in 1962, making it one of the more modern secondary schools in Motherwell. Indeed, the school has recently undergone modernization works, with the pink and yellow panels replaced by a glass-exterior. In 1974, Braidhurst would convert into a six-year comprehensive school, which it has remained since.
Facilities.
The school contains the two-storey main building, containing amenities such as library, gymnasiums, theatre/assembly hall and cafeteria, and is adjoined to a four-storey tower block, containing additional learning facilities such as a computer suite. 
There are also wet-weather facilities for pupils based within the main building of the school.
An large indoor sports barn is also available, which is a facility capable of hosting indoor sporting events such as football, volleyball and basketball, as well as being a venue for sports clubs and physical education classes. Dressing room and shower facilities are also based inside the barn.
Recently, the school has undergone some upgrades, and that includes the installation of an outdoor, full-size, floodlit, astroturf pitch that is used by the school and the wider community. There are also dressing room and shower facilities built nearby the outdoor facility.
The School is also ideally located near the Greenlink Cycle Path, a direct route from Strathclyde Park to Motherwell Town Centre.
Recognition.
The new outdoor playing fields have meant that in 2008, Braidhurst became a designated SFA School of football facility, one of six facilities with this status in Scotland. This meant that young footballers all around Lanarkshire could apply for a place in Braidhurst through the initiative. They would then win the SFA Quality Mark Award for outstanding educational provision. They have also been awarded the National Sports Comprehensive Status.
The school has also been a winner of the Customer Service Excellence award (previously the Charter Mark) on three occasions (2001,2004,2007), for excellent public service. This is further strengthened by the wide range of clubs and activities that the school offers on a yearly basis.
An HMIe Report, commissioned on 19 January 2010, stated that it noted various strengths within the school. Some of the strengths included the high level of climate for learning, the politeness of the pupils, the pupils overall good behavior, the many examples of good leadership throughout the school and the sense of identity through the schools status as a sports comprehensive and school of football.
The academy teams of Motherwell Football Club use the schools sports facility for training purposes.
Catchment area.
As well as being a secondary school for the Forgewood suburb of Motherwell, Braidhurst is also in the catchment area of other areas of Motherwell including North Motherwell, Jerviston and even Mossend. Pupils usually get transferred to Braidhurst from Muir Street Primary, Calder Primary and Logans Primary.

Hadrosteidae

Hadrosteidae is a family of arthrodire placoderms from the Late Devonian. It was originally erected for the late Frasnian "Hadrosteus", from the Kellwasserkalk facies. Later, the family was subjectively subsumed into Dinichthyidae due to "Hadrosteus"' anatomical similarities with "Dunkleosteus" and "Dinichthys". In 1967, Obruchev placed the enigmatic arthrodire "incertae sedis" "Diplognathus", from the Eastern American Famennian, within Hadrosteidae, on the basis of how the two genera have similar denticle ("teeth") patterns of the inferognathals, though, Denison (1978) contests this placement. With the redefining of Dinichthyidae as a monotypic family for "Dinichthys", and only a few other genera placed within Dunkleosteidae, Hadrosteidae is now seen as a valid family again.

The show.
Wot Cheor Geordie was a radio variety programme broadcast from the BBC Regional Studios in Newcastle. It began in the early 1940s and continued until 1956. It featured songs, plays and sketches, all in dialect; some were only moderately successful, while others were considered outstanding. Generally, the programme was a great success.
In 1948 the programme title was included under the “variety” category in the BBC publicity file and it this fact brought it to the notice of London, who requested a recording. A tape was sent from Newcastle with an assurance that the dialect would be toned down and this could be done without losing its humour,
Prior to this, in the 1930s the BBC attempted to expand into the regions by using local materials and local dialects (but very carefully and gently). The North East of England was no exception, and on 9 June 1937 a sketch was broadcast. It utilised the fictitious character “Geordie Marley” who had been created by Newcastle comic writer Captain Walter Dierecx . The sketch was as follows :-
Programme announcer – This is This is the Northern Programme. Here’s a tale about the day the Marley’s spent going to the place where the Blaydon Races were run. The famous races that the song was written about were held seventy-five years ago today…...
Marley – (after humming the concluding bars) Hillo!, ah’ll back ye knaa wat the tune is? Ay hinnies, “Blaydon Races”, Tyneside’s National Anthem. Did any owlder folk ivor gan te the Blaydon Races? Ah ownly went theor wance, an’ that was the day the ninth o’ June, an’ it wes some race an’ all mind ye. Ah’ll tell ye aboot it”

AOA (band)

AOA (; an acronym for Ace of Angels) is a South Korean idol girl group and band, produced by FNC Entertainment. These groups are constructed of a band with 5 members (Choa, Jimin, Yuna, Yookyoung and Mina), and an idol group consisting of 7 members (all members excluding Youkyoung). The groups debuted on July 30, 2012, with their single album "Angel's Story".
History.
2012: Debut ("Elvis"), acting and "Wanna Be".

AOA was revealed to be a dance group, with some members also playing instruments. Youkyoung (or "Y") is listed as a "half-angel/half-mortal", because she is only a member of the band half, playing the drums, resulting in AOA saying they are a "7+1" group. Explaining the concept of their debut FNC revealed that the seven "full angel" members (Seolhyun, Choa, Hyejeong, Chanmi, Yuna, Mina, and leader Jimin) looked on the human world through their crystal ball, and fell in love with the music of humanity. Youkyoung, the "half-angel, half-mortal", also referred to as the key keeper, became curious about the human world and used the key to visit it with the other angels. The first music video teaser for "Angel's Story" was released on July 24, 2012 and the second teaser was released on July 26, 2012.
"Angel's Story" was leaked on July 28, 2012, with 2 days before the official release. The music video for the title track "Elvis" was released on July 30, 2012. AOA had their debut stage on 9 August on M!Countdown following by Music Bank on 10 August.

Gagik I of Vaspurakan

Gagik I Artsruni (; 879/880 – 936/943) was an Artsruni ruler of Vaspurakan in southern Armenia, first as prince of northwestern Vaspurakan (Gagik III, 904–908) and after that until his death as king, claiming also the title of "King of Armenia" from the Bagratid line. 
He began his career as an ally of the Sajid emir of Azerbaijan Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, from whom he received recognition as king in 908, against the Bagratid Smbat I. His state was recognized by the Byzantine Empire, who awarded him the title of "prince of princes" traditionally borne by the pre-eminent Armenian ruler, and his legitimacy received a further boost when the Armenian "catholicos", John V the Historian, abandoned Muslim-ruled Dvin for Vaspurakan in 924. However, Gagik later reversed his position and allied himself with Smbat's son and successor, Ashot II. He is also notable as the founder of the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

<doc id="36560607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36560607" title="Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)">
Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)

Christopher Hugh Moore (born 1950 in Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom) is an author, journalist, and blogger about Canadian history. A freelance writer since 1978, Moore is unusual among professionally trained Canadian historians in that he supports himself by writing for general audiences. He is a longtime columnist for Canada's History magazine (formerly "The Beaver") and the author of many books. He has twice won the Governor General’s Literary Awards.
Moore immigrated to Canada with his family in 1954, was raised in Nelson and Vancouver, British Columbia, and did undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia. He began his historical career as a researcher with the historic sites service of Parks Canada at Canada’s largest historic site reconstruction, the eighteenth-century Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.
After graduate studies at the University of Ottawa (M.A., History, 1977) and work with the Heritage Canada Foundation, Moore made Louisbourg the subject of his first book, "Louisbourg Portraits: Life in An Eighteenth Century Garrison Town".
Books.
"Louisbourg Portraits" explores eighteenth century social history through archivally based studies of ordinary people: an accused thief, a merchant, a young bride, a migrant fisherman, and a soldier. Called “social history as it should be written,” by historian Desmond Morton, Louisbourg Portraits received Canada’s leading nonfiction prize, the Governor-General’s Literary Award for nonfiction, for 1982. An ebook version was published in 2011.
"The Loyalists: Revolution, Exile, Settlement", published in 1984 to coincide with the two-hundredth anniversary of loyalist settlement in Canada, mixes biographies of prominent and obscure individuals with a broad narrative of the loyalist experience. It received the Secretary of State’s Prize for Excellence in Canadian Studies in 1985.
"1867: How the Fathers Made A Deal", was born in the national debate over the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord constitutional reform proposals. It was “the first detailed examination of Canadian confederation in a generation.” It combines Moore’s characteristic biographical focus with a new emphasis on political over social history. Moore argues that the constitutional processes of the 1860s compare well against the executive-driven deals that failed in the 1980s and 1990s due to a greater inclusion of opposing voices in the Confederation debates. He outlines the principles of Responsible Government laid out by William Warren Baldwin, Joseph Howe, Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin which inspired Macdonald, Cartier, McGee, and the Fathers as they framed the constitution. Canadian political commentator Dalton Camp called 1867 “just about the best book on our history I’ve ever read.” In 2011, "1867" was named one of the twelve best Canadian political books of the previous twenty-five years and published as an ebook.
Collaborative works.
Moore has contributed essays or other work to several multi-authored historical works:
Children's history books.
Though primarily a writer for adults, Moore has written several historical works for young readers.
His other children’s histories include "The Big Book of Canada: Exploring the Provinces and Territories" and "Champlain"
Historical consultant.
As a historian in private practice, Moore often undertakes commissioned research and writing for organizations, institutions, and companies on historical matters. He has worked with or advised the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Film Board, Parks Canada, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Canadian War Museum, the Historica-Dominion Institute, and many filmmakers, educational institutions, and publishers.
Legal history.
In 1994 Moore was commissioned by the Law Society of Upper Canada to write its bicentennial history. Since then he has written the history of the leading law firm, McCarthy Tétrault, and of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. From 1998 to 2011 he wrote a column on legal history for the Toronto-based legal tabloid "Law Times".
Journalism and essays.
Since 1991 Moore’s column “Christopher Moore” on Canadian historical issues, personalities, and controversies has appeared in every issue of Canada’s leading historical magazine, The Beaver, renamed Canada’s History in 2010. He has also written for Canadian Geographic, the National Post, the New York Times, and other periodicals, and he frequently contributes essays on politics, history and culture to the Literary Review of Canada. He has made many radio documentaries on historical subjects for CBC Radio’s “Ideas.”. Moore has been nominated for three National Magazine Awards 
Parliamentary democracy.
After the publication of "1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal" in 1997, Moore began publishing political commentaries on parliamentary democracy in Canada. His common theme has been the lack of accountability in Canadian political leadership. Moore relates this failing to the practice (traditionally rare among parliamentary democracies worldwide) of entrusting political party leadership selection to extra-parliamentary leadership contests in which thousands of party membership holders participate. Moore argues this process means Canadian party leaders, once selected, are in practice accountable to no one, and particularly not to the elected Members of Parliament, a situation leading to the breakdown in parliamentary accountability often referred to in Canada as the “democratic deficit” or the “friendly dictatorship.”
Moore’s argument remains a minority view. All Canadian political parties remain committed to extra-parliamentary leadership selection. Most commentators accept that making Canadian leaders accountable to members of parliament is, as prominent political scientist Donald Savoie has said, “unthinkable.”
Cultural politics.
Long active in the Writers' Union of Canada, Moore served as national chair in 1999–2000. From 2001 to 2007, he represented creators on the board of Access Copyright, Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency. A supporter of collective licensing of copyright, he has been a critic of Access Copyright’s failure to represent creators’ interests fully and effectively. In 2011 he was re-elected to a one-year term on the national council of the Writers’ Union.

<doc id="36560638" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36560638" title="Count of the Székelys">
Count of the Székelys

The Count of the Székelys (, ) was the head of the Hungarian-speaking Székely people living in Transylvania within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. The counts fulfilled administrative, military and judiciary functions. In addition to the Székely "seats", they administered Burzenland and other Transylvanian Saxon territories. The counts' official residence, the fortress at Görgény was situated outside the territories assigned to them.
Appointed directly by the monarchs, they remained independent of the Voivodes of Transylvania. The existence of the office is attested from the 1220s. It was always held by a Hungarian nobleman, never by a member of the Székely community. The office was attached to that of the Voivode in the 1460s.
Origins.
Bishop Otto of Freising refers to "counts" leading the vanguards of the Hungarian troops in the battle of 1146 at the river Lajta. Since the advance guards were at that time formed by Székelys and Pechenegs, the bishop's record may refer to the existence of the office already in the middle of the 12th century. On the other hand, the Székelys, along with Pechenegs, Romanians, and Saxons, were led by the Count of Sibiu against Bulgaria in 1210. The earliest royal charter mentioning a count of the Székelys was issued in 1235, but it refers to an event occurred seven years before, thus the office must have existed in 1228 at the latest.
Jurisdiction.
The Székely groups who had inhabited the valleys of the rivers Hortobágy and Sebes had moved eastward, across the river Olt by the 1220s. Their movement was connected to the arrival of mostly German-speaking colonists (ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons) who settled in the former Székely territories. The Székelys from the Sebes valley formed Sepsiszék, the "seat of Sebes", first mentioned in 1252. In the course of the century, new Székely seats came into being, and the Székely seats together formed the Székely Land under the authority of the count.
The jurisdiction of the Counts of the Székelys was not limited to the Székely Land, since it also extended over some Transylvanian Saxon communities who settled in territories earlier inhabited by Székelys. The Saxons of the districts of Mediasch and Marktschelken were under the authority of the Székely counts from 1320 until 1402, when they were attached to the Saxons seats under the authority of the Count of Sibiu. The Saxons districts of Bistritz, Kronstadt, and Rodna were also supervised by the Counts of the Székelys from 1344.
The Székely counts also held the honors of Görgény and Höltövény, that is they received the royal revenues from these fortresses and the royal domains attached to them. They also received the honors of the fortresses of Törcsvár and the nearby Királykő (at Podu Dâmboviţei) in the 15th century.

Robert L. Hines

Robert Lazarik Hines, (born January 17, 1970) is an American stand-up comedian and actor.
Early life.
Hines was born in Chicago, Illinois to Vera Mae (née King) and Bobby Frank Hines. He attended Chicago Vocational High School on Chicago’s South Side. In August 1988, Hines enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves and was a reservist for six years, serving as a Cannon Crewman, Field Artillery.
Career.
Cook County Jail.
To support himself while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian, Hines began working as a Correctional Officer at Chicago’s Cook County Jail in 1994, at the age of 24. He quit the job in 2003 when he was cast to star in the independent comedy movie, "Chasing Robert", which featured performances by Andy Dick, Larry Miller, Paul Provenza, Rick Overton and Dan Castellaneta.
Stand-up Comedy.
Hines started doing stand-up comedy at the age of 21. His first performance was in June 1991 at the "Funny Firm", a Chicago comedy club owned by Len Austrevitch, who would later cast Hines in his first film roles. After his set, Hines met local comedians Bernie Mac, Evan Lionel, Daran Howard and Shay Shay (Phillip White). Mac and Lionel booked Hines on the spot for their Monday night show at Chicago's Cotton Club, where Hines continued to appear for nearly a year. All four comedians became mentors and friends of Hines. From 1991 to 1996, Daran Howard tapped Hines to perform in his "Laugh Fest College Comedy Tour" with shows targeted to historically Black colleges. Hines credits Shay Shay with helping him learn to make his comedy more personal, telling Steven Johnson of the "Chicago Tribune", “Shay told me I've got to show them my pain.”
In addition to touring and club performances (primarily in the Midwest), Hines has made a number of national TV appearances, including BET’s "Comic View", Comedy Central’s "Comic Justice" and Fox’s "Uptown Comedy Club". In 1995, Hines was nominated for the Sammy Davis, Jr. Musical Comedy Award by BET’s "Comic View Comedy Awards" TV show.
Toby Jones.
In 2008, Hines was cast to portray the character Toby Jones in an internet commercial spoof titled "Jones’ Big Ass Truck Rental and Storage" produced by "Big Dog Eat Child"— a Chicago sketch comedy group. The ad featured a real web address and Hines’ actual cellphone number and was inspired by the local hard-sell TV commercials the creators— brothers Pedro Castro and Ramiro Castro— saw growing up in Chicago. The two had spotted Hines during a stand-up comedy performance at Chicago’s Lakeshore Theater in January 2008.
The "Jones’ Big Ass Truck Rental and Storage" video was released in November 2008, and became a viral video sensation, garnering over 700,000 hits in its first two weeks of release. Hines received hundreds of calls to his cellphone from all over the world, with many people believing the spot was advertising a real business.
In April 2009, "Big Dog Eat Child" released "Jones’ Good ASS BBQ and Foot Massage", and followed with "Jones’ Cheap ASS Prepaid Legal and Daycare Academy" in November 2009. Subsequent releases have included recordings of actual phone messages left on ‘Toby’s’ voice mail, a series of “Ask Toby” advice videos and spoofs of ‘Legal Retraction & Clarification’ videos from the ‘urban entrepreneur’.
Recognition for the videos (often in competition with real commercials) has often been as wacky as the spots themselves:
Jail Material.
In 2012, Hines began devoting an increasing amount of his stand-up performances to material from his days as a Correctional Officer. Hines had largely avoided the topic earlier in his career due to training he received that urged officers to pursue outside interests and to compartmentalize their work at the jail as a way to avoid burnout.
Daniel Tosh Rape Joke Controversy.
When asked his opinion on the July 2012 controversy surrounding comedian Daniel Tosh’s put-down of a female heckler with a reference to gang rape, Hines told "Chicago Sun-Times" blog writer Sarah Terez-Rosenblum, “For me, as a stand-up, I want you to leave my show happy. I want everybody to get laid after they get through seeing me. And I want all that sex to be consensual." 
Personal.
Robert L. Hines is married to Reneé Hines and lives in Los Angeles.

Busways in Brisbane

Brisbane, Queensland, Australia has a 25 km network of busways as a form of bus rapid transit, comprising grade-separated bus-only corridors, complementing the region's rail network to provide faster, more efficient bus services to residents of South East Queensland. Management of the busway network is the responsibility of the Translink Transit Authority as coordinator of South East Queensland's integrated public transport system.
The Brisbane busway network currently consists of the South East Busway, Northern Busway and the Eastern Busway and served over 70 million passengers in 2011.
Facilities.
Stations on the Brisbane busway network comprise two semi glass-enclosed platforms, labelled platform 1 for services inbound to the CBD and platform 2 for services outbound from the city, with the exception of Boggo Road busway station platforms which are numbered 5 and 6 respectively to align with the parallel train platforms.
Real Time Passenger Information is displayed at each station, with fixed LED signs suspended above each platform. These signs present four lines of real-time estimated bus departure times, with data provided by Brisbane City Council's RAPID system. Busway stations contain full disabled accessibility, passenger seating, 24 hour CCTV cameras and emergency help point buttons. Bicycle access and storage is provided at most stations, as are go card fare machines. Public art may be found in some busway stations, tunnels and walls.
Capacity.
In peak hour, 294 buses per hour (1 every 12 seconds) passed the busway network's busiest point (a section of the South East Busway north of Woolloongabba Station) in 2007, a number estimated to be approaching the busway's absolute maximum vehicle capacity using the current bus fleet. Given the maximum capacity of a majority of Brisbane Transport buses is 62, any point along the busway network has a maximum theoretical passenger capacity of approximately 18,228 passengers per hour, since the entire network is built to the same specifications as the Woolloongabba stretch.
Planning History.
The "South East Queensland Integrated Regional Transport Plan 1997" recommended a 75 km, 65-station network of busways to be constructed in Brisbane in order to provide a rapid public transport system to areas of Brisbane not served by the existing heavy rail network. A busway system was recommended over an expansion of the Queensland Rail network given the existing strong role of buses in the regional transport system and its cost effectiveness compared with constructing rail lines. It was envisaged that feeder buses would serve both busway and rail stations, allowing buses to service low-density communities whilst bypassing peak hour traffic congestion by using the busways where appropriate.
This recommendation built upon the Brisbane City Council's earlier "Brisbane Busway Plan" which was broadened into the "SEQ Regional Busway Network" plan. A network of 5 busways was planned which, "inter alia", would improve the operation of the bus fleet whilst reducing maintenance and running costs.
Construction History.
In August 1996, the Queensland Government approved the South East Transit Project which began planning and constructing the South East Busway between Brisbane's CBD and Eight Mile Plains. The first section of the busway, between the CBD and Woolloongabba, opened in September 2000 to coincide with the first match of the Olympic Games Football Tournament at the Brisbane Cricket Ground (The Gabba). The second section between Woolloongabba and Eight Mile Plains opened on 30 April 2001 at a final cost of over $600 million. Construction to extend the busway to Springwood is under way, scheduled for completion in mid-2014.
Planning for the construction of the Northern Busway began soon after the success of the South East Busway was demonstrated by increasing bus commuter statistics. The first section, from Roma Street in the CBD to Herston, was opened in February 2004 at a cost of $135 million. The second section, originally named the Inner Northern Busway, was opened in May 2008 at a cost of $333 million and linked the Northern Busway to the South East Busway through tunnels underground the Brisbane CBD and a new station underneath King George Square. A further extension from Herston to Windsor, costing $198 million opened in June 2009. In June 2012, construction of a further extension from Windsor to Kedron opened, costing $444 million.
In 2007 construction began on the first stage of the Eastern Busway, entitled the Boggo Road Busway. The first stage was completed in August 2009, costing $366 million and involving the construction of the Eleanor Schonell Bridge and Australia's longest busway tunnel underneath the old Boggo Road Gaol. A 1 km extension of the Eastern Busway from Buranda to Main Avenue, Coorparoo commenced in August 2009 and was completed in August 2011 at a cost of $465 million.
Future Construction.
A final stage of construction of the Northern Busway from Kedron to Bracken Ridge, due to be completed by 2026 is currently in doubt given Queensland's finances. The Queensland Government is currently planning to extend the Eastern Busway from Main Avenue, Coorparoo to Capalaba, Queensland via Old Cleveland Road. It is unclear if western or south western suburbs are still corridors under consideration for new busway construction.
Brisbane City Council is independently conducting a $2 million, 18 month feasibility study into constructing a bus-only bridge from the Cultural Centre Busway Station, linking to a busway tunnel travelling underneath the CBD and ending in Fortitude Valley, Queensland. This is to relieve bus congestion on the CBD streets and the Victoria Bridge (caused by traffic lights operating at both ends of the bridge, seriously inhibiting the clearance of buses from the Cultural Centre Busway Station in peak hour.
Significance and Criticism.
Brisbane's network of busways is significant because it is the largest scale adoption of busways as a form of rapid public transport in Australia. Patronage numbers have grown over the busways' 12 year existence from carrying 0 to 70 million passengers annually, reducing the growth in traffic congestion and air pollution and minimising the need for new vehicular routes into the city along the busway corridors.
Brisbane's busways were designed to allow buses to service low-density suburbs and bypass peak hour congestion on major roads, linking with the rail network to improve public transport connectivity. This allows a balance between the convenience of localised bus services with the efficiency of medium haul commuter transport to the city's activity centres in a highly radial city like Brisbane.
However a system designed like this can be argued to increase the likelihood of dead running and under use of available capacity. Dead running occurs on any highly peak-oriented radial bus or rail system where additional peak direction buses are added into the schedule or operated as "rocket" express routes. After or before their run in the peak direction the buses generally run empty, whether to head out for another run, back to the depot or to be positioned prior to starting another run (such as, in the afternoon peak). On the Busways many of these dead running vehicles are perceived to be under-utilised and to contribute to congestion. The counter argument to this is that this issue is related more to the dominance of the CBD as the largest employment centre within the region and that to change this requires a shift to forced interchanging for many people, likely reducing the attractiveness of the service. It is also true that these routes generally, but not always, bypass the most congested sections of the busway network by using alternative approaches to the city such as the Captain Cook Bridge or Water Street. The perceived under-utilisation of available capacity is where less than full services travel on the busway. It is argued that this is caused by low patronage on the off-busway portion of many suburban routes. This has been argued to lead to busway route duplication where these services then enter a busway corridor and continue on into the inner city without being full, and to increased busway vehicular congestion and unnecessary air pollution created from vehicle emissions without a correspondingly high number of passengers. The counter argument to this is that by running these buses on the busway they provide additional available capacity to the often over-crowded spine services and that that forced interchange onto over-crowded spine services would reduce the attractiveness of bus as an travel option.
Robert Dow from commuter advocacy group Rail Back on Track has advocated for a shift to a trunk/feeder busway system where busway routes are serviced by fewer, higher fequency routes with connections to suburban 'feeder' bus routes (much like an integrated bus/rail network) in order to simplify network maps, reduce dead running and congestion. However this solution would increase the number of interchange connections passengers are required to make per journey in contrast to the current system.
The decision not to connect the Brisbane City Council's Legacy Way tunnel to the Northern Busway to provide for shorter travel times from the western suburbs to the city (via the Inner City Bypass) was also criticised as short sighted given the lack of planned busway construction to those suburbs.

Slatur

Slátur (Icelandic: pronounced slau:tər) or "slaughter", made from the innards of sheep. There are two types of slátur; blóðmör (Icelandic) or "blood pudding" and lifrarpylsa ("liver sausage"). The first is similar to Irish and British black pudding and the latter similar to Scottish haggis although neither contain the spices used in British Isles cuisine. They are also much smoother in texture.
Ingredients.
Ingredients for slátur are sheep's blood, chopped or minced sheep's fat, chopped onions, oatmeal, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, thyme, pepper, salt, whole milk and sausage skins.
About.
Both blood pudding and liver are prepared in a similar fashion. Pouches are cut and sewn from the stomach, as in traditional haggis, or artificial non-edible pouches can be used. They are filled with a mixture of sliced/minced fat (mör) or suet, flour (rye and oats), rolled oats and either blood or liver minced finely (sometimes kidney is also blended in). The pouches are sewn shut after filling, then they are slow boiled for 2–3 hours. Slátur may be eaten hot or cold and sometimes it is pickled in whey.
Blood pudding has been made using sheep's blood in Iceland since ancient times and similar recipes exist in many countries, using pig's blood instead. In previous centuries moss was used instead of imported flour. Liver pudding seems to have come into being at a much later stage; references to it appear during the mid-19th century. 
Offal is food of the autumn, prepared at the traditional slaughter time. Right up until the mid 20th century slátur was made in every home in Iceland. Many families made slatur together as a common activity. After the economic crash in autumn 2008, there appears to have been a considerable increase in slátur sales, as slátur is cheap food. Prepared and cooked offal, both blood and liver pudding, is available in stores all year round but many people consider it largely as þorramatur, at the festival of Þorrablót, celebrated in January and February each year. Slátur is presented alongside other savoury and sour dishes at this time of year, including hákarl.
Blood pudding is sometimes served with cinnamon and sugar, or sometimes with raisins. When it is served hot is usually eaten with mashed or boiled potatoes and swede/yellow turnip. It can also be cut it into slices and fried in a pan. Liver pudding is also eaten hot with potatoes. Pickled or cold new blood pudding and liver pudding are commonly cut into slices and served with porridge or a type of cold rice pudding called hrísgrjónagrautur.

Smiley Bates

Smiley Bates (October 16, 1937 - January 8, 1997) was a Canadian country singer, songwriter, and musician. He recorded over forty albums in his career and sold over three million records worldwide. Bates also performed on radio stations, CJKL-FM and CKJB. He died of cancer on January 8, 1997, at Bent River in the Muskoka municipality of Canada.
Early life.
Born Harvey Edgar Bates on October 16, 1937, in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Canada, Smiley had seven brothers and three sisters and grew up in a family in which country music was a major part of life. His father played the fiddle and performed at square dances, where his backing band often included his wife.
At an early age, and without money to buy an instrument of his own, Smiley would sneak his father's fiddle away. Determined to play his own instrument, Smiley attempted to convert a baseball bat into a fiddle by drilling holes for the strings at one end, and by using a finishing nail and four mandolin pegs. This unusual instrument was eventually amplified. When his father's old fiddle was damaged and thrown out, Smiley salvaged the instrument from behind the barn. Once it was reconditioned, but still having only two strings left, the eager young musician used thread to repair a "hairless" bow and began practicing.His mother, listening to his first attempts asked Smiley, while she was baking bread, "Do you know what that tune is that you're playing?" "It's the tune that was played when the old cow died!"
Smiley heard the 78 RPM records of Hank Snow that his brother brought home, and the dynamic guitar sound on the old gramophone inspired Smiley to take up that instrument. His first guitar was an Eaton's mail order model, and the drive that he possessed soon resulted in a growing proficiency on this new musical item. Smiley would be given another instrument, with the understanding that if he mastered it, another would be added to the list. And so he progressed through banjo, mandolin, and dobro until his skill warranted more expensive instruments, now obtained from the local music store. No more mail order "specials". Smiley spent an enormous amount of time learning instruments. He began playing the guitar at the age of six.
By the time he was eleven he was out playing his first job with a group called Curly Carter and the Mountaineers. In the band, Smiley played fiddle, and they performed together for about three years, after which Smiley formed his own band, around 1951.
Musical career.
In the group was Mike LaPorte on fiddle, his brother Shep on rhythm guitar, and Smiley on lead guitar. Called the North Star Ramblers, they performed together for about five years entertaining listeners on radio stations CJKL in Kirkland Lake and CKGB in Timmins. Doing this routine prompted Smiley to say, "I thought I was a big shot at 14 doing two radio shows!"
Eventually, the Laporte brothers moved to the Ottawa Valley and Smiley formed a new band, featuring Jerry Goselin on rhythm guitar and bass, and Mike Zuppan on accordion. This lineup enabled the band to play straight country and polkas in clubs where they worked the Quebec circuit, which at that time offered more opportunities than Ontario.
The band stayed together for three years before breaking up at which time Smiley, taking a holiday, visited two of his brothers in British Columbia. Undecided on which area to try next, Smiley ended up in Oshawa, which was a local centre for country music, and while there, he talked to Slim Gordon, and decided to undertake an Ontario tour with a combination of club dates and one-night stands at arenas and halls. By this time, country music had grown in popularity, and before television became established in Northern Ontario, there was a lucrative circuit for performers willing to endure the rough touring from town to town.
As it happened, Slim Gordon decided not to do road jobs, Leroy Glazier on electric guitar, and Rosemary St. John was on electric bass, he left Slim's band and joined Smiley.
Thus began seven years of Northern Ontario road shows. As Smiley related, "In every town, Leroy fell in love, and had to be dragged away!"
Rosemary was sufficiently attractive to inspire one amorous chap to demolish the door to her hotel room before help arrived. "He was either very eager to get an autograph or he felt he had to say goodnight in person" laughed Smiley.
The club circuit is an exhausting life, with little chance to develop one's own style, especially in the fields of songwriting and recording, and seven years is a long time, so when Leroy was offered a good job in the U.S. the band broke up and Smiley began working as a single, still in clubs, but adding only another rhythm guitar when the need for a duo was encountered. In this case Hank Beamen provided second guitar.
Recording and record deals.
Around 1966, Smiley recorded for the first time. A single record, "The Gal Who Invented Kissing" and "My Nova Scotia Home" was issued as a custom pressing. A part-time D.J. who was off his shift at 6 A.M. and was doing the recording at 7 A.M., taped the songs in Smiley’s motel room.
Some time after this record was released, Smiley met a singer who had recorded for Paragon Records in Toronto and he mentioned the name of Jack Boswell as the man to see. Their meeting would prove to be quite an astounding event.
To start with, Jack did not recognize Smiley, since the singer did not play the Toronto club circuit.
When Smiley announced that he would like to "cut an album", Jack asked, "Do you have a demo tape?" "No", said Smiley, "I don't and I don't do auditions either".
Intrigued by this show of confidence, Jack inquired a trifle sarcastically, "What day would you like to record the album?" "We don't need a DAY - an hour will do" was the reply.
Taken aback, Boswell exclaimed, "Well what else can you do to fill up the studio time?" (Which is usually a 3 to 5 hour stretch.) "I play fiddle and 5-string banjo", replied Smiley. Expecting to catch him up, Jack retorted, "Well, why not record a banjo AND a fiddle album?" Smiley said "Fine." 
Thus, Smiley was signed to record for Paragon Records in 1968 and the day before the session was to take place, he cautioned the backup musicians on the need for an early night. However, a friend called Smiley to invite him to a corn roast that night, and after staying up till 5:30 A.M., Smiley, fortified with aspirins and coffee, made it to a 9 A.M. recording session.
"Amazing how many things can be made out of corn", commented Smiley, while Jack advised doing the banjo album first!
In 5 1/2 short hours, 3 albums were recorded. "Golden Guitar", "5-String Banjo Bluegrass", and "Fiddler's Dream", engineered by the late Bill Bessey, who was known to his fans as "Cousin Bill" on CBC radio, and later the announcer on the Tommy Hunter TV Show.
“Songs from the Heart” which was another big-selling vocal album; and “Flat Top Guitar Instrumentals” showcasing Smiley’s amazing cross-picking style on the Guitar and played a big part in advancing his career followed these up in 1969.
Revised approach to touring.
By 1971, when album sales were increasing, Smiley decided to give up club work, with all the pressures and problems. He continued to tour the Maritimes where he enjoyed great success and attended annual events like the Shelburne Old Time Fiddle Festival.
In 1973 Doug Taylor (Smiley's record producer at the time) asked him to headline an all-Canadian country show in Wheeling, West Virginia, featuring Joe Firth, Bobby Munro, Joanne Post, Steve Smith, and Eastwind.
As Smiley told it, "The very first note I broke a string, but someone tossed me a Martin and I went right ahead with the show."
He received a warm welcome and had to do a 15 minute encore.
Smiley's guitar style was attracting considerable attention, and at the 1974 Carlisle Bluegrass Festival, Smiley worked on an energetic jam session. Someone handed him a guitar, and said "Put some guitar stuff in this number". Smiley started playing "the only way I know how" and Josh Graves, the famous dobro player who was part of the Flatt & Scruggs Foggy Mountain Boys for years, sat and listened till the song was over and said to Smiley, "Ain't but two people that can play flat-top like that, and the other one's dead - only you left now!"
Working with American Country Artists.
Later, as they talked about music, Josh invited Smiley to go to Nashville and record with him. At that time, being under contract, he was not authorized to say yes or no, but more important he said "I have been a Canadian recording artist always, and what I have done with record sales has been totally in Canada, with Canadian musicians. If American artists want me to record with them, they are welcome to come to Canada and I'll be happy to work with them!" ... and later they did. In 1974 the record company brought Shot Jackson, his wife Donna Darlene, and Benny Martin from Nashville to do some sessions. Shot recorded an album with Bob Lucier titled "Sail Along". Donna Darlene had minor hits with "The Other Side of Me" and "Make An Honest Woman Out Of Me", and Benny Martin recorded an album titled "Nashville Southern Fiddle". Benny had heard of Smiley and asked if he would play flat top guitar. Smiley agreed. That album has become a classic, as has the Shot Jackson/Bob Lucier album.
The Smiley Bates guitar style took its inspiration from Hank Snow, whom Smiley considered "one of the perfectionists of the flat top", but by age 16, Smiley was already fashioning the intricate series of notes that go together to make up cross-picking. This brilliant approach to lead guitar is similar to Scruggs style banjo in its effect but to achieve the rippling lines with a flatpick takes considerable skill.
Commercial success.
Smiley's albums caught on, not only in Ontario, but especially in the Maritimes and Newfoundland, and increasing sales brought more recording sessions, with carefully chosen album titles by Smiley himself, a factor that helped boost sales.
Titles such as "My Mother", "Songs Of Life", "Path of Memories", "True Stories From Life's Other Side", and "History of Sadness", point to the key to Smiley's vocal success - the "Hurting Song".
Nobody can say for sure what makes sad songs so popular, but the albums are clear evidence that a voice like Smiley's filled these numbers very effectively.
Smiley's commercial success prompted other recording ventures. When the Instrumental hit "Duelling Banjos" from the film "Deliverance" was popular, Smiley, on Flat-Top Guitar was teamed with Eddie Poirier on 5-String Banjo. Though he had not seen the film, it only took a couple of tries to arrive at an arrangement, which, while not representative of Smiley's recording output, was nevertheless a commercial success.
A further album was issued with Eddie and Smiley, and based upon its success, the two teamed up with Rose (Eddie's wife) to record another big-selling Bluegrass album, titled "The Best of Bluegrass".
The suggestion was made at one point that Smiley's country sound should be "Modernized" by the addition of strings, horns, and background singers. He actually went into the studio and spent some time "rehearsing" the new sound, but at the end of one day of rehearsal, Smiley said flatly "Enough is enough. I sing straight Country! If the people didn't like what I sing, they wouldn't buy my records, BUT they do buy them, so I must be doing something right!".
To illustrate just how successful Smiley's recordings were, TeeVee Records (a company advertising on television) put together a package of 20 songs and instrumentals from Smiley's previous albums entitled "The Best of Smiley Bates". This album sold in excess of 100,000 units of records and tapes.
As Smiley would say, "You can take the Boy out of the Country, but you can't take the Country out of the Boy!"
This proved a point. With proper advertising and promotion, a purely Canadian country record can be incredibly successful. TeeVee Records was able to take older material and promote it on television and sell an unheard-of quantity of records and tapes.
Due to the success of the TV record sales Smiley was offered long term recording contracts by three major recording companies.
A major part of the appeal of the Smiley Bates sound lies with the material. Obviously the songs strike a responsive chord with Country fans. A song entitled "Will You Love Me When I'm Old and Feeble" proved to be very popular, as did "Don't Tell Jeannie I'm Blind" and "My Daddy's Eyes". Other successful songs included "I'll Go Get The Toolbox", "Daddy and the Wine", and "Let Me In" by Gene Chrysler. Probably the most requested was the song "Golden Guitar" written by Curtis Leach.
After the release of the first instrumental album in 1968, more were recorded to meet the demand. Smiley's own instrumental numbers such as "Crying Guitar", "The Last Sunrise", "Charlie's Boogie", "Flat Top Chimes", and "Newfoundland Reel" please fans of the Flat Top Guitar.
Indeed, so popular did Smiley become Down East that many people were convinced that he was a Maritimer. As a result of the warm welcome he received in person on his tours, Smiley stated, "One area is home to me as much as the other." This takes in a big area, from Ontario to Newfoundland, to call your front porch!
A sidelight, which indicates how well known Smiley's sound, really was, occurred one time when someone approached Smiley and asked him if he had ever been in a movie. Told that the never had, the fan persisted, asking "But did you ever sing in a movie?" "Yes I Did" replied Smiley. "Was the movie called Wedding in White?" "It Was". "I knew it was you singing" said the enthusiastic fan.
The song referred to was all of 30 seconds worth of background music on a jukebox, yet that brief sequence was enough for instant recognition.
Stompin' Tom Connors.
In his years on the road, Smiley had naturally run into many interesting characters and when the name of Stompin' Tom Connors was mentioned; Smiley had some stories to tell.
Smiley knew of Stompin' Tom in Timmins, Ontario, at the beginning of Tom's career.
The two singers met some time later at the Wawa Motor Motel. Smiley recalled a tall, slim fellow wearing a Cowboy Hat who introduced himself and mentioned that he was interested in finding work in Wawa. An arrangement was made to provide continuous entertainment and Stompin' Tom's famous board and original material went over well in the clubs.
Smiley recounted an incident in which someone requested a Merle Haggard song and Stompin' Tom replied, "When Merle starts singing my songs, then I'll start singing his!"
Tom was very outspoken, and an amusing incident took place in a Wawa hotel dining room. Smiley, Leroy Glazier, and Tom were eating dinner one day. It should be mentioned that the food in this establishment was not quite what you'd call the best. While they were eating, the cook appeared and sat down with his dinner, as luck would have it, at the next table. Tom, not certain that he could finish his own meal, in spite of his hearty appetite, looked over at the cook and asked, "Don't tell me you eat here too?"
During this period, Tom stayed up all night writing songs. The only unfortunate thing about this was the fact that he would do his writing and practicing in Smiley's hotel room.
Said Smiley with a grin, "Even though Tom kept me awake all night, he got all the royalties from those songs!"
Tom wrote songs about towns he played in and when his success in Northern Ontario encouraged him to attempt to land a recording contract in Toronto, he asked Smiley for his advice.
"Tom", said Smiley, seriously, "I don't think it'll work!"
The two remained good friends and Smiley chuckled and commented "How Wrong I Was!"
Later years.
Bates traveled widely playing at festivals and fairs where he met hundreds of fans. "Without the people, there wouldn't be me", stated Smiley, who enjoyed prioritizing his fanbase and maintaining his knowledge of their favorite songs. He has been called the "King of Hurtin' Songs".
Death.
Bates continued to perform "Down Home Country Songs" and "Fine Flat Top Pickin"' for fans during the mid-1990s, until he was diagnosed with cancer. Bates' final live performance before his death was at the Manitoulin Folk Festival. 
Bates' final three years were spent battling cancer and he eventually died on January 8, 1997, in Bent River, Ontario, Canada.

Hajigak mining concession

Hajigak Mine is the best known and largest iron oxide deposit in Afghanistan is located at Hajigak in Bamyan Province, it is also Asia’s biggest untapped iron ore deposits. The deposit itself stretches over 32 km and contains 16 separate zones, up to 5 km in length, 380 m wide and extending 550 m down dip, seven of which have been studied in detail. The ore occurs in both primary and oxidized states. The primary ore accounts for 80% of the deposit and consists of magnetite, pyrite and minor chalcopyrite. The remaining 20% is oxidized and consists of three hematitic ore types. The deposit remained unmined in 2006. The presence of coking coal nearby at Shabashak in the Dar-l-Suf District and large iron ore resources made the deposit viable for future development of an Afghan steel industry. Open pit mining and blast furnace smelting operations were envisioned by an early feasibility study. The Hajigak also includes the unusual niobium, a soft metal used in the production of superconducting steel.
History.
History reveals that Germans were the first one to exploit this deposit systematically after planning a steel mill during or after World War I. But the Great Game prevented this venture. Russians in the sixties prepared a comprehensive report on the mineral resources of Afghanistan and tried to exploit but they also failed.
When the Kala Bagh steel mill was planned in the late 1960s in Pakistan, it was thought to use some percentage of Hajigak iron ore as the Pakistani mines were not of good quality but this scheme also failed.
Geology of Hajigak.
Afghanistan has a complex geology due to its position on the junction between the Indo-Pakistan and Asian crustal plates. It is composed of a series of terranes that broke away from the main Gondwana super-continent before becoming accreted onto the southern margin of the Eurasian plate. The accretionary events started in the Cretaceous, around 140 million years ago, and have continued until recent times. At some stage in the early Cretaceous there is evidence of a collision of one of these blocks, the Farad block, with the Eurasian plate, along the Herat fault zone. Shortly afterwards, the Helmand block collided with the Farad block. The rocks that host the Hajigak deposit are within the Herat fault zone, and it is likely they were originally part of the Farad and Helmand Blocks.
The oldest part of the succession crops out north-west of the Hajigak deposits. It consists of grey silicified limestones and dolomites interbedded with dark grey crystalline schists and light coloured quartzites that display evidence of amphibolite grade metamorphism. The Hajigak iron deposit is hosted by the Upper Proterozoic Awband Formation that, together with the underlying Kab Formation, constitutes the Qala Series, a sequence of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks up to 4500m thick. The Kab Formation consists of dark grey sandy sericitic schists, interpreted as metamorphosed terrigenous rocks, acid volcanic rocks and minor beds of marble and phyllite. The Awband Formation is made up of schists (quartz-sericite, quartzchlorite-sericite, quartz-sericitechlorite and carbonaceoussericite) that are metamorphosed acid and basic tuffites and argillaceous rocks. Minor cherts and marbles also occur. The Green Schist Formation, a distinctive unit overlying the Awband Formation, consists dominantly of green chlorite schists, and quartz-sericitic schists locally intruded by granodiorites. Some reports consider it as a member of the Awband Formation. Upper Devonian rocks of the Hajigak Formation are faulted against the Green Schist Formation. Strata of Lower Cretaceous and younger age crop out in the south west of the area, unconformable on the older sequences. 
The predominant strike of the Proterozoic and Palaeozoic rocks is between north-east and north-north-east, with a regional dip of approximately 50° towards the south-southeast or south-east. One major steeply dipping fault juxtaposes the Upper Proterozoic rocks against the crystalline middle Proterozoic rocks. Another throws Upper Devonian rocks against the Upper Proterozoic Green Schist Formation. In addition a suite of north–south and north-west–south-east trending faults, some of them probably thrusts, affect the Upper Proterozoic succession, including the iron ore deposits.
The Upper Proterozoic rocks of the Qala Series are interpreted as being deposited in a slowly subsiding marine basin. The initial basin fill was a variable sequence of sandstones and minor volcaniclastic sediments. Later there was an increase in volcanic activity and exhalative iron-rich fluids formed lenses on the sea floor. These sediments were subsequently altered by burial and low-grade (greenschist facies) metamorphism and became the basement of the Helmand Block. This block drifted away from Gondwana supercontinent in the Triassic. During the collision with Eurasia, in the early Cretaceous, faulting juxtaposed the Upper Proterozoic Qala series, the Middle Proterozoic rocks and the Upper Palaeozoic rocks. These fault-bounded blocks are a local characteristic of the Herat fault zone. As the collision
progressed, the faulted blocks were folded into a northeast–south-west trending anticline the axis of which passes to the north of the area mapped. A series of thrusts developed as indicated by the increased thickness of the iron ore and its host rocks within the central zone at Hajigak. During the final phase of faulting the north–south and north-west–south-east faults that affect the ore deposits were developed. Later post-Cretaceous extension led to the further development of north-west–southeast faults and graben structures filled with young sediments. Subsequent erosion has exposed the core of the Hajigak anticline with the concordant ore bodies on the southeast limb.
Mineralisation.
The Hajigak deposit trends north-east–south-west for about 9 km and is made up of 16 separate ore bodies, each up to 3 km in length. The deposit can be divided up into three geographical parts, the western, central and eastern parts. In addition to the large ore bodies there is a substantial area of thin fragmental ore deposits in the form of four surficial deposits. The main hematitic ore is medium- to fine-grained and displays a variety of massive, banded and porous textures. It occurs in lenses and sheets, within the Awband Formation. The thickness of the lenses has been indicated by drilling to be up to 100m, while the depth of mineralisation is untested 180m below surface. There are two main ore groups: unoxidised primary ores and semi-oxidised ores. The primary ores occur below 100 m and consist of magnetite and pyrite, and up to 5% chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The oxidised ores, extending up to 130m below ground surface, consist mainly of magnetite, martite and hydrogoethite. Two other oxidised ore types, hydrogoethite/hematite/semi-martite and carbonate/semi-martite, occur sporadically in small amounts in the deposit. Alteration that may be related to the mineralising event has been observed within the host rocks, and includes sericitisation, silicification and carbonisation.
Exploration.
Iron occurrences were observed during initial geological mapping of the area in the mid thirties but the economical potential was
not fully recognised until a joint Afghan-Soviet project, between 1963 and 1965, carried out an extensive study which mapped
and described the deposit in some detail. The regional geology was mapped at 1:50 000 while the Hajigak deposit was mapped at 1:10 000.
Focusing on the western area of the deposit, the study included detailed prospecting, trenching, ore sampling, four deep drillholes, a 200 m long horizontal adit and shafts into the fragmental ore. For two of the main ore bodies, I and II, horizontal plans and vertical crosssections were generated allowing the ore to be resource classified.
Development.
The remote and mountainous location of Hajigak makes it a challenging project for future development. However, the large tonnage and high iron content make it attractive to companies with the proven ability to plan and develop large world-class mines in demanding areas. The deposit remains untested below 180m and there is a potential for ore at greater depth. Additional prospects and mineral occurrences over a 60 km along strike, at Darrah-i-Nil, Khesh, Zerak, Kharkiza, SurkhiParsa, further increase the potential of the area. A feasibility study for the exploitation of the Hajigak deposit was undertaken in 1972 by a Franco-German group, Nenot-Pic. This proposed the construction of a blast furnace, based on the occurrence nearby of coking coal, providing an opportunity for the creation of an integrated iron and steel plant.

<doc id="36560848" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36560848" title="Temporal dynamics of music and language">
Temporal dynamics of music and language

The temporal dynamics of music and language describes how the brain coordinates its different regions to process musical and vocal sounds. Both music and language feature rhythmic and melodic structure. Both employ a finite set of basic elements (such as tones or words) that are combined in ordered ways to create complete musical or lingual ideas.
Neuroanotomy of language and music.
Key areas of the brain are used in both music processing and language processing, such as Brocas area that is devoted to language production and comprehension. Patients with lesions, or damage, in the Brocas area often exhibit poor grammar, slow speech production and poor sentence comprehension. The inferior frontal gyrus, is a gyrus of the frontal lobe that is involved in timing events and reading comprehension, particularly for the comprehension of verbs. The Wernickes area is located on the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and is important for understanding vocabulary and written language. 
The primary auditory cortex is located on the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. This region is important in music processing and plays an important role in determining the pitch and volume of a sound. Brain damage to this region often results in a loss of the ability to hear any sounds at all. The frontal cortex has been found to be involved in processing melodies and harmonies of music. For example when a patient is asked to tap out a beat or try to reproduce a tone, this region is very active on fMRI and PET scans. The cerebellum is the "mini" brain at the rear of the skull. Similar to the frontal cortex, brain imaging studies suggest that the cerebellum is involved in processing melodies and determining tempos. The medial prefrontal cortex along with the primary auditory cortex has also been implicated in tonality, or determining pitch and volume.
In addition to the specific regions mentioned above many "information switch points" are active in language and music processing. These regions are believed to act as transmission routes that conduct information. These neural impulses allow the above regions to communicate and process information correctly. These structures include the thalamus and the basal ganglia.
Some of the above mentioned areas have been shown to be active in both music and language processing through PET and fMRI studies. These areas include the primary motor cortex, the Brocas area, the cerebellum, and the primary auditory cortices.
Imaging the brain in action.
The imaging techniques best suited for studying temporal dynamics provide information in real time. The methods most utilized in this research are functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, and positron emission tomography known as PET scans.
Positron emission tomography involves injecting a short-lived radioactive tracer isotope into the blood. When the radioisotope decays, it emits positrons which are detected by the machine sensor. The isotope is chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule, such as glucose, which powers metabolic activity. Whenever brain activity occurs in a given area these molecules are recruited to the area. Once the concentration of the biologically active molecule, and its radioactive "dye", rises enough, the scanner can detect it. About one second elapses from when brain activity begins to when the activity is detected by the PET device. This is because it takes a certain amount of time for the dye to reach the needed concentrations can be detected.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI is a form of the traditional MRI imaging device that allows for brain activity to be observed in real time. An fMRI device works by detecting changes in neural blood flow that is associated with brain activity. fMRI devices use a strong, static magnetic field to align nuclei of atoms within the brain. An additional magnetic field, often called the gradient field, is then applied to elevate the nuclei to a higher energy state. When the gradient field is removed, the nuclei revert to their original state and emit energy. The emitted energy is detected by the fMRI machine and is used to form an image. When neurons become active blood flow to those regions increases. This oxygen-rich blood displaces oxygen depleted blood in these areas. Hemoglobin molecules in the oxygen-carrying red blood cells have different magnetic properties depending on whether it is oxygenated. By focusing the detection on the magnetic disturbances created by hemoglobin, the activity of neurons can be mapped in near real time. Few other techniques allow for researchers to study temporal dynamics in real time. 
Another important tool for analyzing temporal dynamics is magnetoencephalography, known as MEG. It is used to map brain activity by detecting and recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents generated by neural activity. The device uses a large array of superconducting quantum interface devices, called SQUIDS, to detect magnetic activity. Because the magnetic fields generated by the human brain are so small the entire device must be placed in a specially designed room that is built to shield the device from external magnetic fields.
Other research methods.
Another common method for studying brain activity when processing language and music is transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS. TMS uses induction to create weak electromagnetic currents within the brain by using a rapidly changing magnetic field. The changes depolarize or hyper-polarize neurons. This can produce or inhibit activity in different regions. The effect of the disruptions on function can be used to assess brain interconnections.
Recent research.
Many aspects of language and musical melodies are processed by the same brain areas. In 2006, Brown, Martinez and Parsons found that listening to a melody or a sentence resulted in activation of many of the same areas including the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the Brocas area, anterior insula, the primary audio cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.
A 2008 study by Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici found that language impairment may also affect the ability to process music. Children with specific language impairments, or SLIs were not as proficient at matching tones to one another or at keeping tempo with a simple metronome as children with no language disabilities. This highlights that fact that neurological disorders that effect language may also affect musical processing ability. 
Walsh, Stewart, and Frith in 2001 investigated which regions processed melodies and language by asking subjects to create a melody on a simple keyboard or write a poem. They applied TMS to the location where musical and lingual data. The research found that TMS applied to the left frontal lobe had affected the ability to write or produce language material, while TMS applied to the auditory and Brocas area of the brain most inhibited the research subject’s ability to play musical melodies. This suggests that some differences exist between music and language creation.
Developmental aspects.
The basic elements of musical and lingual processing appear to be present at birth. For example, a French 2011 study that monitored fetal heartbeats found that past the age of 28 weeks, fetuses respond to changes in musical pitch and tempo. Baseline heart rates were determined by 2 hours of monitoring before any stimulus. Descending and ascending frequencies at different tempos were played near the womb. The study also investigated fetal response to lingual patterns, such as playing a sound clip of different syllables, but found no response to different lingual stimulus. Heart rates increased in response to high pitch loud sounds compared to low pitched soft sounds. This suggests that the basic elements of sound processing, such as discerning pitch, tempo and loudness are present at birth, while later-developed processes discern speech patterns after birth.
A 2010 study researched the development of lingual skills in children with speech difficulties. It found that musical stimulation improved the outcome of traditional speech therapy. Children aged 3.5 to 6 years old were separated into two groups. One group heard lyric-free music at each speech therapy session while the other group was given traditional speech therapy. The study found that both phonological capacity and the children’s ability to understand speech increased faster in the group that was exposed to regular musical stimulation.

Gaza (band)

Gaza was an American metalcore band from Salt Lake City, Utah.
Formed in 2004, they are signed to Black Market Activities and have released one extended-play and three full-length albums. They are known for their complex and heavy sound, as well as their outspoken anti-religious and political views.
History.
The band formed in Salt Lake City intending to be an indie band but, according to then-bassist Jon Parkin, that "lasted about half a practice". 
The original lineup consisted of Casey Hansen on drums, Parkin on bass, and Michael Mason and Luke Sorenson on guitars. With this lineup they played their first two shows with different vocalists first with Dustin Dransfield and then with Dreu Hudson. After their departure, Parkin switched to lead vocals, and bass player Chris Clement was added. With this lineup, the band recorded their debut EP "East" in 2004, which was distributed by Exigent Records.
In 2006, the band signed to label Black Market Activities, on which they have released "I Don't Care Where I Go When I Die", "He Is Never Coming Back", and "No Absolutes in Human Suffering". After the release of "He Is Never Coming Back", Sorenson left the band, leaving them as a four-piece group.
In March of 2013, the band announced that they were disbanding. This followed Jon Parkin's sexual assault on a 19 year old woman.

C. P. Ramachandran

CP Ramachandran (1923 – 15 April 1997), was an Indian journalist and political activist.
Early life.
Ramachandran was born in Burma of Malayali parents, Chittenippattu Krishnan Nair and C P Janaki, who were from Ottapalam, Kerala, India. After a short period in Burma, CP spent his boyhood in Ottapalam. His education was in Ottapalam and Government Victoria College, Palakkad. After his intermediate schooling he joined the Royal Navy as a mid-ship man. During the Naval Mutiny in 1946, he was under surveillance by the Intelligence Department, as he had a strong Communist Party background prior to his Naval life. After leaving the Navy he worked in the Army for two years in Ahammed Nagar. Finishing his military life, he returned home in 1948, the year after independence, and became very active in the Party once again. All his party works were centred on Ottapalam. When the Party was banned, CP was arrested and sent to Kannur Central Jail. After his release set out to Bombay whilst the police watched him continuously. In 1952 he was called by A. K. Gopalan and immediately started woreking for Goplan's election campaign.
Career.
In 1953, following the instructions of E. M. S. Namboodiripad, CP went to Delhi to join the Party newspaper 'Crossroads', which later became 'New Age', and began his career as a journalist. Until 1955 CP was a reporter with the paper. When he had some disagreements with the basic ideas of his Party, he started to write his views in Shankar's Weekly under the name 'Agastya'. Although Namboodiripad warned him, CP was not prepared to compromise, resulting in his expulsion from the Party along with Edathatta Narayan and Aruna Asaf Ali. He then joined Shankar's Weekly as Assistant Editor. His columns, entitled 'Man Of The Week' and 'Free Thinking', were very popular. He met Jalabala Vaidya, then a trainee reporter and now the famous theatre actress, and in 1958 they got married. CP's marriage lasted just six years as they obtained a mutual divorce in 1964, after fathering two children Jai and Anasuya. In 1960 CP joined The Hindustan Times as Parliament Correspondent. His column 'Last Week in Parliament' was much discussed. When B G Vargeese was fired from the paper in 1974, CP filed a suit against Birla who was the owner of the newspaper. It became an notable chapter in the history of Indian Journalism. In 1986 CP retired from Hindustan Times as Deputy Editor.
Death.
He never wished to remain in Delhi, where he had lived most of his life as an intellectual and a journalist, so went back to his mother in Parali, Palakkad, and was with her when she died. CP lived his last 11 years in Parli, until he died on 15 April 1997. His daughter Anasuya and son Jai were with him at the end

Sage, Bethel, and Pleasant Hill, Texas

Sage, Bethel, and Pleasant Hill were small closely linked towns in Burnet County, Texas. They were close to the small town of Lake Victor and seven or eight miles away from Burnet, Texas.
Sage.
Sage is located on the north fork of the San Gabriel River where the old Austin-San Saba Road and the old Burnet-Lampasas Road cross. Many believe the name Sage comes from the large amount of sage grass that is located there. The first people came to Sage before the 1860s and consisted of A.N. Murphy, J.A. Murphy, Hugh McCoy, Alfred Shelby. Other families came to the area in later years and consisted of Andy Feilds, George Newt Jones (and family), the Harkriders, Pates, Bentons, Hodges, Hahns, Purcells, Everetts, Pipers, and many other families. These families were primarily from Mississippi, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Many people from Sage were veterans of The Civil War and both World Wars.
General store.
In 1890 George Newt Jones built the general store that was on the land owned by the Murphys. Jones was the storekeeper and went to Lampasas twice a month to get supplies. Some supplies included pickles, vinegar, candy, flour, corn meal, suigar, green coffee and every once in a while apples and oranges (every thing came in sacks or barrels. Mark Baily was the last storekeeper when the store closed in 1918.The store joined the Feild land and created a picnic ground and every year they held a barbecue on the Fourth of July thay would sometimes last for more than a day there was games, a swimming hole and even candidates would speak. And in the winter they would put up a tent and entertain the residents.
The old store building still stands today.
Other businesses.
Hugh M. Murphy built the first Sage gin and then after many years of wear and tear Hugh Murphy's son, Herb, made a new gin in 1900 which operated until 1929. Ira Feild was the last operator of the gin (1924–1929). The only other operators of the gin was Jim Everett and his family.
Sage established a post office on November 17, 1874 which had Jesse G.W. Howard as Post Master but was discontinued from 1884-1898(during which time the people of sage got their mail from Sunny Lane). The post office then reopened and ultimately closed in 1906 when the mail was redirected to Burnet.
In 1884 Sage had three churches, and a steam corn mill
There was no school or cemetery in Sage so the residents sent their children to school in either nearby Bethel or Pleasant Hill and also buried their dead in the same locations.
Stage stop.
For many years Sage was a stop on the stage route between Burnet and Lampasas. The stage route ran from Lampasas to Burnet Twice a week for many years until travel to and from Lampasas and Burnet became higher in demand. Then the stage ran everyday both ways.
Growth and Decline.
In 1884 Sage had 75 residents, and in 1900 Sage had 242 residents at its highest population total.
Sage began to decline after the small town was bypassed by the Houston and Central Texas railway in 1903 and by 1940 only a few scattered houses marked the place where sage once stood and by the 80's there was nothing But the old city limit sign and general store building to mark the once prominent town.
Bethel.
Bethel was a small sister town to Sage and used Sage' gin, store, and post office but Bethel had a church, cemetery, community center and school.
Located Seven or eight miles northeast of Burnet on R.R. 963 and on county road 202. The name Bethel comes from almost definitely the biblical village of Bethel.
The people of Bethel were mostly from Kentucky, South Carolina, and Mississippi Just like nearby Sage. Many People from here also were veterans of wars also like Sage.
School.
The Bethel school was established in 1869 with John T. Chamberlain as the teacher even though there was no land given to the school until 1874 and on July 11, 1874 A.R. Johnson and T.E. Hammond deeded 3 acres to Thomas Glimp and Jesse G.W. Howard for the Bethel school (Volume I, Page 320, DRBC) and they gave 3 more acres to Thomas Glimp, C.H. Hahn, and Jesse G.W. Howard for the school(Volume I, Page 456, DRBC). The school had one teacher and 25 students in the 1890s and closed in 1941 with John L. Chamberlain and Ruth Fluitt.
Growth, and Decline.
Just like Sage, Bethel declined after Sage was bypassed by the Houston and Central Texas Railway but it did not decline quite as fast as Sage. Several houses and the cemetery marked Bethel in the 40's. Scattered houses, a community center, and the cemetery marked Bethel in 1990. And today only a few houses, the cemetery, and historical marker the what used to be the town of Bethel.
The Historical Marker.
The Historical Marker Says: ""Bethel Cemetery: The REV. Richard Howard (1817 - 1882) moved to this area of Burnet County in 1885. The frontier settlement he joined would later be known as the Bethel Community. In 1874 he deeded two acres at this site for the community use. The first recorded burial was that of Howard's Grand-daughter, Harriet Ruthie Howard, in 1875. Since then this site has been used as the Bethel Community Cemetery. Buried here are veterans of the Civil War to World War II and many of the area's early settlers and their descendants. The Bethel Cemetery Association was established in 1930"."
Pleasant Hill.
Pleasant Hill was a small community located about eight or nine miles Northeast of Burnet on Farm to Market 2340 between Bethel and Lake Victor and was closely linked to Sage and Bethel but also Lake Victor. Pleasant Hill had its own school and cemetery.
The people in Pleasant Hill were, like Sage and Bethel, mostly from Kentucky, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Many men were veterans from this town like Sage and Bethel.
The School.
THe School at Pleasant Hill was a two room structure built in 1884 and was deeded along with 5 acres on October 14, 1885 to School District #2 by William Hodge and T.J. Stewart. The school was then given to the Lake Victor and Bethel school districts in 1905 because of overcrowding in those communities schools.This school was called 'Pleasant Vieiw'.
Growth and Decline.
Pleasant Hill also started to decline under the same lines as Sage and Bethel. All that marked Pleasant Hill in the 90's was the cemetery and scattered houses. Now the old grounds of Pleasant Hill are only marked by the cemetery and a couple houses.

HMT Alvis

HM Trawler "Alvis" was a British trawler that was taken up from trade and used by the Royal Navy during the Second World War. She was returned to the fishing industry at the end of hostilities in 1945.
Pre-War Career.
6 Nov 1918: Launched by Ailsa Shipbuilding Company at Ayr, for The Admiralty as "Peter Hall".
1919: Registered by The Admiralty in the Registry of British Ships at London.
24 Aug 1920: Registered by The Admiralty as a fishing vessel at London.
Nov 1924: Sold to Société Anonyme Armement Ostendais, Ostend.
29 Nov 1924: Registered at Ostend as "Transport Union".
27 Dec 1935: Rescued crew of fourteen of Dutch trawler "Cornelia Maria" (SCH135) which was sinking. 
1939: Sold to Saint Andrew’s Steam Fishing Co Ltd, Hull.
1 Mar 1939: Registered at Hull as "Alvis" (H52). Fishing from Fleetwood.
Early World War II.
On the 18 Sept 1939, just after the start of WW2, the "Alvis" was fishing in the vicinity of St Kilda. At about 1.20pm a shot was heard and a large spout of water erupted close to the Alvis. The skipper and crew then spotted a German submarine. The skipper, Albert Thomason, was signalled from the U Boat and instructed to abandon his vessel. The small lifeboat was launched and the crew left the "Alvis". The lifeboat pulled alongside the submarine, the U-35, and the commander, Werner Lott, asked for the captain of the "Alvis". Thomason went aboard the submarine and, on the conning tower, Lott extended his hand in welcome. He then said, "" I am sorry but I will have to sink your ship"" and asked Skipper Thomason if there were anymore crew aboard the "Alvis". The crew and Lott, all speaking very good English, handed cigarettes to the "Alvis" crew, and then ordered them back to their vessel. Lott sent a working party over to Alvis under the command of a Lieutenant. On their arrival, they threw the wireless overboard and then chopped away the fishing gear and smashed the dynamo in the engine room. The Lieutenant asked Thomason if he could take a lifebelt as a souvenir, which he did. However, Lott gave Thomason a bottle of gin in return with his compliments. 
No provisions or the fish caught were taken from the "Alvis" by the Germans. The reason the U-Boat commander did not sink the "Alvis" was that, in his opinion, the 13-man crew would never make it back to shore in their lifeboat. The "Alvis" returned unharmed to her homeport of Fleetwood, but that same day the U-Boat commander found 3 other Fleetwood vessels. They were the "Arlita", the "Lord Minto", and the "Nancy Hague". After removing the crews from the "Arlita" and "Lord Minto" onto the "Nancy Hague", the U-35 sank the two empty ships. The three crews returned to Fleetwood aboard the "Nancy Hague". 
The "Alvis" was subsequently requisitioned in 1940 by the Admiralty. Werner Lott was taken prisoner of war aboard HMS "Kingston", with all of his crew, after he scuttled his U-boat on 29 November 1939.
U-35's Account of Events.
The fishing trawler "Alvis" was the first British ship U-35 encountered in the North Atlantic. She allowed "Alvis" to pass unharmed on 18 September 1939, after realising that the thirteen man crew could never have reached land in the available lifeboat. In return, the British captain warned U-35 that the Royal Navy aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" was in the general area.
The following details were extracted from U-35`s war diary:
""The steamer is of enemy origin. He should be destroyed, because confiscation is not possible. His operation area was far away from the coast and because of that he could not be considered a "coastal fishery vessel". The fish catching equipment and the radio were thrown overboard. The crew of 13 which had already embarked into the rescue boat was advised to get back onto the ship, because the freeboard of it was already very narrow and was not considered seaworthy. The steamer was dismissed. There were no attempts to escape or other resistance.""
Crew on 18 Sep 1939.
Name, Initial, Age and Job Title
Naval Service.
"Alvis" was requisitioned for war service as an anti submarine trawler, on 30 Apr 1940. She was given the pennant number 4118 and the Admiralty paid a hire rate of £84.0.0d per month. "Alvis" was given one 12pdr gun as her main armament and assigned to the Royal Naval Patrol Service. 
"Alvis" was fitted out as a minesweeper in May 1941, and from January 1942 she was based at Hartlepool with M/S Group 148. She took part in the minesweeping operations that were vital to the success and safety of the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944: 
Fate.
"Alvis" was returned to civilian service just before the end of the war in Europe in Mar 1945. She was then owned by a number of companies including: Ocean Steam Trawling Co Ltd, Milford Fisheries Ltd, Boston Deep Sea Fisheries Ltd, and Argosy Trawling Co Ltd of Fleetwood. "Alvis" was eventually scrapped at Barrow-in-Furness in 1954.

Billy Hicks (sport shooter)

Billy G. Hicks (born 1927) is an expert moving target shooter, and distinguished himself in high speed moving target competitions around the world and the United States from 1965-1981. He began shooting trap and skeet in 1961, and by 1965 was training on Olympic trap ranges. Olympic trap targets travel out of the bunker at 90 miles per hour, verses the 50 mile per hour rate of standard trap and skeet. He became a member of the United States World Championship Trap and Skeet Team in 1966. His hit ratio on Olympic moving trap and skeet targets was 98.8%, and he was considered to be one of the United States Marine Corps best Olympic clay target shooters. In 1966 his team won gold for their country at the Olympic trap World Championships in Wiesbaden, Germany. The team consisted of Billy Hicks, Gordon Horner, Charles Jenson, and Ken Jones. This is also the event where he earned the highest award to be given to any United States shooter, the U.S. International Distinguished Shooter Badge (his number is #100). The following year, Hicks was again picked as part of the four man U.S. Team to compete for gold in Bologna Italy, along with James Beck, Chris Bishop, and Richard Loffelmacher. His team won the silver that year. Billy Hicks was confirmed by the NRA as the first American to fire a perfect 200 x 200 straight in Olympic trap, at the Preliminary Olympic International Clay Pigeon Competition in Thurmont Maryland on May 19th 1968. At the end of his military career, Hicks held a Gold, Silver, and Bronze medal in International Shooting awarded at both the Wiesbaden and Bologna ISSF events. He retired from the United States Marine Corps in 1971, and began a career as a shooting instructor at Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier PA. He continued to shoot in the ATA circuit. He was awarded the South Eastern States Clay Pigeon Championship - NRA Civilian Champion Award in 1972. In 1981, at the age of 54 he again distinguished himself as one of the foremost moving target shooters in the Live Bird World Championships in Guadalajara, Mexico. Hicks competed with over 600 of the worlds top moving target shooters for two days straight in a "miss and out" competition, miss one bird and your out of competition. He came in second in the world for the United States. He retired from trap and skeet shooting in 1988.

Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, abbreviated HITECH Act, was enacted under Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (). Under the HITECH Act, the United States Department of Health and Human Services is spending $25.9 billion to promote and expand the adoption of health information technology. The Washington Post reported the inclusion of "as much as $36.5 billion in spending to create a nationwide network of electronic health records." At the time it was enacted, it was considered "the most important piece of health care legislation to be passed in the last 20 to 30 years" and the "foundation for health care reform."
The former National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Dr. Farzad Mostashari, has explained: "You need information to be able to do population health management. You can serve an individual quite well; you can deliver excellent customer service if you wait for someone to walk through the door and then you go and pull their chart. What you can't do with paper charts is ask the question, 'Who didn't walk in the door?'"
Subtitle A--Promotion of Health Information Technology.
Part 1--Improving Health Care Quality, Safety, and Efficiency.
Electronic Health Records (EHR).
The HITECH Act set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The "goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs — that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care."
Title IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for Medicaid to those who adopt and use "certified EHRs" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH act (ARRA) requires doctors to show "meaningful use" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there are no penalty provisions for Medicaid.
Health information exchange (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve "meaningful use" and receive stimulus funding. Healthcare vendors are pushing HIE as a way to allow EHR systems to pull disparate data and function on a more interoperable level.
Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.
"Meaningful use"
The main components of Meaningful Use are:
In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity.
The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows:
The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records:
The detailed definition of "meaningful use" is to be rolled out in 3 stages over a period of time until 2015. Details of each stage are hotly debated by various groups. Stage 1 was finalized in July 2010 while stage 2 was finalized in August 2012. Stage 3 has not yet been finalized.
Meaningful use Stage 1
The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.
Full list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements.
Core Requirements:
Menu Requirements:
To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to "attest" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.
National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (HIT).
There is established within the Department of Health and Human Services an Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). The National Coordinator is appointed by the Secretary and reports directly to the Secretary.
The National Coordinator is responsible for the development of the Nationwide Health Information Network.
HIT Policy Committee.
The HIT Policy Committee recommends a policy framework for the development and adoption of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that permits the electronic exchange and use of health information.
HIT Standards Committee.
The HIT Standards Committee recommends to the National Coordinator standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. The Standards Committee also harmonizes, pilot tests, and ensures consistency with the Social Security Act.
Subtitle D--Privacy.
Part 1--Improved Privacy Provisions and Security Provisions.
The HITECH Act requires HIPAA covered entities to report data breaches affecting 500 or more individuals to HHS and the media, in addition to notifying the affected individuals.
This subtitle extends the complete Privacy and Security Provisions of HIPAA to business associates of covered entities. This includes the extension of newly updated civil and criminal penalties to business associates. These changes are also required to be included in any business associate agreements with covered entities. On November 30, 2009, the regulations associated with the new enhancements to HIPAA enforcement took effect.
Another significant change brought about in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act is the new breach notification requirements. This imposes new notification requirements on covered entities, business associates, vendors of personal health records (PHR) and related entities if a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI) occurs. On April 27, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued guidance on how to secure protected health information appropriately. Both HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) were required under the HITECH Act to issue regulations associated with the new breach notification requirements. The HHS rule was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2009, and the FTC rule was published on August 25, 2009.
The final significant change made in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act implements new rules for the accounting of disclosures of a patient's health information. It extends the current accounting for disclosure requirements to information that is used to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations when an organization is using an electronic health record (EHR).

<doc id="36561088" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36561088" title="Ulwe">
Ulwe

Ulwe (also Ulwa, Ulva or Ulawe) is a node of the city of Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra, India. It is developed and maintained by CIDCO. It is located in Raigad district. Ulwe is going to be a major successful planned place to live after Vashi. It has attracted many people to buy property. The metro project of Navi Mumbai connects Ulwe prominently. Ulwe has rising land rates based on the pretext of a proposed international airport.
Ulwe has a sports complex with football, badminton, hockey, swimming pool and indoor stadium. Ulwe has seen drastic increase in property rate due to the geographical location and proximity of the proposed international airport, Seawoods-Uran railway line and a proposed trans harbor link from Sewri to Chirle village.
Ulwe has big land parcels belonging to Reliance Industries Ltd. on which big residential and commercial activities are expected to start. The nearest railway station is the proposed Bamandongri railway station, named after the village settlement located in the node.
Many buildings and constructions are being developed in Ulwe. CIDCO buildings are also being constructed in there. The Navi Mumbai international airport is nearby to Ulwe. A sea link from Sewri to Nhava Sheva is proposed.
Ulwe Port.
Ulwe is situated at the Panvel creek and is at a distance of 6 miles from Panvel. There is a wharf at Ulwe. The old pier is in a dilapidated condition. This port is not approachable to big steamers. There are two seasonal sailing vessels for passenger traffic. Mostly these vessels are used for carrying vegetables and fruits to Mumbai. The chief goods exported from Ulwe are fruits and vegetables, rice, grain, salt, firewood and sand.
Modern History.
City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) a registered company under the company's act of 1972 and is responsible for development of the Ulwe node and all the other nodes in Navi Mumbai. The other nodes in Navi Mumbai are Vashi, Sanpada, Nerul, Kharghar, Panvel, Turbhe, Airoli, Dronagiri and Ulwe. Originally land parcels were owned by farmers in this node. CIDCO brought land from farmers and has been developing these land parcels. The Ulwe node has a river (Ulwe river) passing through the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport. To the north east of the node lies the Gahdi river. The node also has more than 300 hectares of mangroves.
As per a Micro Market Report on Ulwe by Indiaproperty.com, over the last five years, prices of properties in Ulwe, have scaled-up with an average annual appreciation ranging between 25-30%. The spurt and recognition of Ulwe as one of the fastest growing Mumbai suburbs, has come about because of both in progress and proposed infrastructure projects. Unfortunately as of today, there is no clarity regarding the progress and future of these big infrastructure and development initiatives. SEZ, Airport and the improved connectivity via the sea link, are seen as engines that will ensure that the area and the surrounding places get good-quality roads and other infrastructure.
Talking about the current status of Ulwe, the micro market is yet to develop and lacks basic infrastructure including a network of roads, water supply and drainage system. Public transport available is also limited with few buses and private auto-rickshaws.
Environmental Context.
The nodes in the environmental perspective are very rich, with 300+ hectares of mangroves and two rivers. Rivers Ulwe and Ghadi pass through the Ulwe node in the proposed international airport area. Construction and development has only been possible after containing, diverting these rivers and mangroves. Approximately 200 hectares of mangroves will be destroyed for the upcoming international airport. The environmental clearance for the project has been given based on relocation or re plantation of these 200 hectare mangroves. Cidco has proposed a mangrove park north of the airport site. The river Ghadi is to be diverted altering its meeting point in the Panvel creek. Environmentalist fear flooding of Panvel area because of this alteration.
Karnala bird sanctuary is just below the Dronagiri node, south east of the node. The bird sanctuary is small, approximately 11.2 km. square. Along with Sanjay Gandhi national park and Tungerashwar sanctuary is the boundary of Mumbai Metropolitan region. Dronagiri fort is located in the southernmost tip of Dronagiri spread over an area of 17km. square and is bound by karnjha river on the south-east. It lies between the town of Uran and karanjha. Port based activities take place around the area.

Carroll House Hotel

Also its "architectural composition, one of restraint and simplicity, represents the Second Empire and Shingle styles from this period. Few changes have occurred with the building, resulting in a high degree of integrity."
