Palmeira Square

Palmeira Square is a mid-19th-century residential development in Hove, part of the English city and seaside resort of Brighton and Hove. At the southern end it adjoins Adelaide Crescent, another architectural set-piece which leads down to the seafront; large terraced houses occupy its west and east sides, separated by a public garden; and at the north end is one of Hove's main road junctions. This is also called Palmeira Square, and its north side is lined with late 19th-century terraced mansions. Commercial buildings and a church also stand on the main road, which is served by many buses (some of which terminate there).
The land was originally occupied by "the world's largest conservatory", the Anthaeum—a visitor attraction planned by botanist, author and building promoter Henry Phillips. The giant dome's collapse and total destruction on the day it was due to open in 1833 made Phillips go blind from shock, and the debris occupied the site for many years. Work began in the early 1850s and was largely complete in the mid-1860s, although commercial and residential buildings such as Palmeira House and Gwydyr Mansions continued to be added at the northern end throughout the late 19th century. English Heritage has listed the residential buildings on the western, eastern and northern sides of the square at Grade II for their architectural and historical importance, although one building has the higher Grade II* status because of its opulent custom-designed interior.
History.
The ancient parish of Hove covered of good agricultural land on the southern slopes of the South Downs, leading down to the English Channel. There was Celtic and Roman occupation of the area, and a Bronze Age barrow was found close to Palmeira Square's northern end when the land was being developed. Inside was a wooden coffin, a stone axe, a bronze dagger and the Hove amber cup, a relic of national significance now held at the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery. Some estimates dated the barrow as early as 1500 BC, but radiocarbon dating indicates the burial took place in about 1239 BC.
One of the main farms was Wick Farm, which covered about of land immediately west of the parish boundary with Brighton. The first post-Norman Conquest landowners were the de Pierpoints; in 1573 the estate was bought by the Stapley family, of which Anthony Stapley became famous as one of the regicides of King Charles I. In 1701 it was acquired by the Scutt family from Brighton. Western Road and its continuation Church Road, the earliest east–west route through Hove, bisected the estate.
On the land was a chalybeate spring, later called St Ann's Well, which became a popular visitor attraction by the mid-18th century. In the early 19th century, its fashionable reputation increased as neighbouring Brighton began to grow rapidly as a high-class seaside resort. Following the lead of Queen Adelaide, who would ride to St Ann's Well to visit the spa and take the waters, wealthy residents and visitors to Brighton travelled across the parish boundary to walk round the gardens, visit the ornate pump-room and enjoy the apparently health-giving properties of the iron-rich water.
Rev. Thomas Scutt, who owned the Wick Estate land by the 1820s, started to sell plots of land to "capitalis on the insatiable demand for building land along the seafront". Brunswick Town was the first result of this, and when Sir Isaac Goldsmid, 1st Baronet bought the rest of the land (over ) in 1830 he continued Hove's residential expansion by commissioning Decimus Burton to design Adelaide Crescent and by agreeing to fund the construction of "the world's largest dome" at its northern end. The ostentatious Anthaeum, proposed by botanist and horticultural writer Henry Phillips and designed by prominent local architect Amon Henry Wilds, was to have been a vast circular conservatory containing exotic plants and trees. It was built between 1832 and 1833 but collapsed spectacularly the day before its scheduled opening date, making Phillips go blind from shock and apparently distressing Goldsmid so much that he abandoned any further plans for development of his land for 20 years—during which time the wrecked glass and iron structure lay where it fell at the north end of the incomplete Adelaide Crescent.
In the early 1850s, Goldsmid (who had been given the title "Baron de Goldsmid e de Palmeira" by the Queen of Portugal in 1845) decided to restart development at Adelaide Crescent. He abandoned the original plan for a horseshoe-shape plan and in 1851 commissioned an unknown architect to extend it northwards into a bottle shape, north of which (on the site of the Anthaeum) would be a new residential square: Palmeira Square. The remains of the Anthaeum were cleared in the early 1850s (or possibly as late as 1855), and work began.
Houses on the west side of the square, close to the western boundary of the Wick Estate land, were the first to be built. The southernmost houses on each side are attached to the north end of Adelaide Crescent, which was completed in the early 1860s; "the transition from crescent into square is most elegantly handled in a double curve". Between 1855 and 1870, 34 houses were built, all in the same "vigorous and healthy" post-Regency Victorian/Italianate style. It took several years for the houses to be occupied. Numbers 33 and 34 on the west side were the first to be taken, in 1859, and by 1866 none of the 17 houses on that side were empty. The first house on the east side was let in 1864, and it took ten years for the whole square to be occupied. Early residents included a wine merchant, a factory owner, and Lady Emily Fletcher who shared the house with her mother, five children and nine servants.
An Anglican church to serve the area was provided in 1854. St John the Baptist's Church, a flint-built Decorated Gothic Revival building with a landmark spire, was designed by William and Edward Habershon. Work began in 1852, and the site (at the northwest corner of Palmeira Square, where it joined Church Road) "compels traffic to take an abrupt turn before proceeding westward". It may have been built there to block attempts to build a road north from the Palmeira Square area into the mostly undeveloped land to the north which later became the Cliftonville area of Hove. In keeping with the high-class surroundings, the church was "for many years one of the most fashionable" in either Brighton or Hove.
The houses of Palmeira Square were separated from Church Road by a private road which ran parallel (east–west) to the main road, creating a second square of open space. Only residents of Palmeira Square and Adelaide Crescent could gain entry to it; there was a chain across each entrance and a watchman controlled admission. Church Road itself was laid out as a thoroughfare in 1851; until then it had been a footpath. In the same year, an Act of Parliament (the Brunswick Square Improvement Extension Act) was passed to bring Palmeira Square and nearby developments into the jurisdiction of the Brunswick Square Commissioners. Had this Act not been passed, the square would have been governed solely by "the rather nebulous authority of the Parish officials of Hove". One consequence was that Sir Francis Goldsmid (who inherited his father Sir Isaac's estate on 1859) was able to delegate responsibility for the maintenance of the Palmeira Square Enclosure (the garden between the west and east sides) to the Brunswick Square Commissioners from April 1865. Previously Goldsmid himself had to employ and pay a gardener.
In 1891, the Hove Commissioners (who now had civic responsibility for the square) tried to make the private road north of the square a public thoroughfare by removing the barriers. Objections from the residents delayed this plan for several years, but the road did eventually open to the public. Accordingly, the land to the north was now considered part of the Palmeira Square area, and the development as a whole consists of two garden squares. The first is the original development bounded to the south by Adelaide Crescent, to the north by the former private road which is now a widened continuation of Western Road and to the west by the 34 houses of the square. The second is the lawned section formed by the junction between the extension of Western Road, Church Road and the connections between them, and all the surrounding buildings of the late 19th century.
The open land in between these roads was laid out with grass and was named the Palmeira Mansions Enclosures after the "very fine" Palmeira Mansions were built on the north side of Church Road in 1883–84, effectively forming a new north side to Palmeira Square. Local architect Henry Lanchester designed the mansions and Jabez Reynolds built them. Some of the houses were still unoccupied by 1891 because of a slowdown in the property market. Despite this slump, another local firm, Clayton & Black, designed Gwydyr Mansions on an adjacent site in 1890. The luxury flats, in a Flemish Renaissance Revival style which contrasts with their Italianate neighbours, had an integrated bank, barber's shop and residents' restaurant. In 1889, businessman A.W. Mason (owner of Mason's Ink) bought 33 Palmeira Mansions and in 1899 commissioned S.H. Diplock to give it a new interior according to "the most extreme Victorian theatrical taste". This building is now owned by The English Language Centre Brighton, a language school. Tours of the interior are a feature of the annual Brighton Fringe Festival.
On 2 June 1953—the day of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II—a floral clock commemorating the event was unveiled in the centre of the Palmeira Mansions Enclosures. Hove Council's Director of Parks and Cemeteries, G.A. Hyland, was the designer. Its slightly raised circular design may be a reference to the nearby Bronze Age barrow, which was destroyed by building work at the north end of the square in 1857. It was the only one on the Sussex coast and was larger than examples found on the South Downs. (The centre of the site is at , about north-northeast of St John the Baptist's Church). The clock had a double face—the first floral clock in the world to have this feature—each with a diameter of . Clockmakers James Richie & Son, who had designed a floral clock in Edinburgh, provided the mechanism. About 35,000 flowers were initially planted, and special temporary floral designs were sometimes put in—for example, to commemorate Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.'s Football League Third Division South title win in 1958, the Queen's Silver Jubilee of 1977 and the Brighton and Hove in Bloom competition in 1998. Vandalism has been a recurrent problem since the 1980s, though.
According to a watercolour by an unknown artist ("Adelaide Crescent and Palmeira Square", 1895) which was sold at auction in 2002, five tennis courts were intended for the Palmeira Square Enclosures. No work towards these plans was ever carried out.
Written in the original deeds to each house was a requirement that the exterior of the building and its attached railings and doors had to be painted every three years. This was updated in 1892 to state that "three coats of best oil paint" in a pale stone colour had to be used. Observance of this rule lapsed over time until Hove Council reinforced it in the 1970s—stating that magnolia paint had to be used. Other stipulations added at various times included the maximum number of flats each house could be converted into and a prohibition of drying laundry where it could be seen from outside. Many houses have been converted into flats, including numbers 2–5 (in 1919), 7 (1922), 8 (1921), 10 and 11 (1927), 20 (1932) and 30–34 (1904–10).
Transport.
Palmeira Square is a key destination for the city's buses: many serve it en route to other destinations, and the high-frequency route 25 terminates there. The following routes, all operated by the Brighton & Hove bus company, stop at Palmeira Square:
The Coastliner 700 service from Brighton to Southsea, operated by Stagecoach South, also serves the square. The nearest railway station is Hove, to the north.
Residents.
Literary journalist Miron Grindea had a flat in number 1 Palmeira Square during the 1970s. Number 2 was home to Sir Isaac Goldsmid's daughter in the late 19th century. Lawyer and writer H. S. Cunningham lived at number 3, and Sir Julian Goldsmid, 3rd Baronet lived next door at number 4; he died there in 1896. Architect John C.L. Iredel, a member of the Chichester Diocesan Panel of Architects who designed the former Emmanuel Church in Worthing in 1975–76 and restored Buxted parish church six years earlier, lived at number 8 and died there in 1990. On the east side of the square, Henry d'Avigdor-Goldsmid lived at number 18 during the 1950s. Lord George Montacute Nevill (son of William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny) and his wife Florence owned number 22; he died there in 1920. Next door at number 23, William FitzClarence, 2nd Earl of Munster lived with his wife Wilhelmina Kennedy-Erskine. They were still living there at the time of their deaths in 1901 and 1906 respectively. Other residents of the square at various times have included diplomat and author Shane Leslie and Peter Birkett, who designed boats in which Richard Branson won transatlantic races in 1986 and 1989.
Heritage.
The east and west sides of Palmeira Square have been listed separately at Grade II by English Heritage, and Palmeira Mansions at the north side of the square has also been listed at this grade under two separate listings. Grade II status is awarded to "nationally important" buildings of "special interest". As of February 2001 there were 1,124 such buildings in the city. The east side (numbers 1–17) and west side (numbers 18–30) were listed on 10 September 1971. Numbers 7–19 Church Road (Rochester Mansions, Palmeira Mansions and Palmeira Avenue Mansions) and 21–31 Church Road (the other sections of Palmeira Avenue Mansions and Palmeira Mansions) were listed on 4 February 1981. Number 33 Palmeira Mansions was listed at the higher Grade II* on 18 July 1978; such buildings are defined as "particularly important of more than special interest". There were 70 Grade II*-listed buildings in the city of Brighton and Hove as of February 2001.
Palmeira Square forms part of the Brunswick Town Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This area was designated by the council in 1969. Brighton & Hove City Council's report on the area's character states that Palmeira Square contributes to "one of the finest examples of Regency and early Victorian planning and architecture in the country".
Architecture.
The square.
Architecturally, Palmeira Square is "quite different from Adelaide Crescent or Brunswick Square ... when Victorian architecture was out of fashion, was condemned as being heavily Italianate". Having been "one of the most notorious examples" of the tendency in Brighton and Hove for residential developments to take much longer than planned, it developed as a natural evolution of the style of neighbouring Adelaide Crescent. Begun as a Regency-style set-piece, this developed in a Neo-Renaissance direction, before work resumed in the 1850s in a simpler post-Regency style. Palmeira Square was then built in a "more full-blooded" interpretation of this Victorian/Italianate theme. Palmeira Mansions, completed nearly 30 years after work started on the square, were designed in the same style and contribute to the square as a single composition, "continuing its ... grandeur and scale". Palmeira Square's style, marking the transition from Regency into Victorian Italianate, has been likened to the terraces around London's Hyde Park that were built at the same time. Architectural historians Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in the 1960s, stated that this gave the square "architectural interest" but "little architectural merit", though. Another author, comparing the houses with those of Adelaide Crescent, wrote of "an undisguised Victorianism of a vigorous and healthy, but nevertheless decidedly inferior, quality".
The 17 houses of the west side form a long, straight terrace of five storeys. Under their stucco façades is brick, rubble and bungaroosh—a composite building material commonly found behind stucco in 18th- and 19th-century buildings in Brighton and Hove. Each house has three windows to each storey (either blocked or containing a sash window, and pilasters and quoins between some of the neighbouring buildings mark the terrace out into a symmetrical five-part composition which has been described as either 2–4–5–4–2 or 2–5–3–5–2. The top storey is in the form of an attic, and the treatment of the windows is different: they are on a moulded cornice, and some are arched. On the floor below, the windows are surrounded by Vitruvian scroll patterns, and at the storey below that they are flanked by pilasters which hold up an entablature and small pediment. A cast iron balcony surrounds the first-floor bay windows and is supported by the top of the Doric-columned entrance porch, which has a stuccoed balustrade. According to one writer, "the heavy emphasis of porches give[s the square an air of respectable solidity"—as do the heavy doors with their recessed panels, moulded ornamentation and decorative fanlights. Original interior fittings include a large "Jacobean-cum-Baroque" chimneypiece in the hall of number 32.
The terrace on the east side is identical, again having 17 five-storey houses with hipped slate roofs hidden behind parapets, three-window ranges with sash windows and heavy Doric porches. As on the west side, the house in the centre projects slightly from the terrace and has a larger square bay window rising through the first and second floors, forming a loggia which is supported on a colonnaded porch with rustication.
H.J. Lanchester's Palmeira Mansions are Italianate in style, like the houses of the square. Some are stuccoed, but others have been painted. The walls are of brick and the roofs have slate tiles. The outermost houses (7, 19 and 21) have entrances set in their side elevations. Each house is five storeys including an attic storey, which has dormer windows added in the 20th century. Each house has a three-window range, and the centremost building is topped by a curved gable. That at numbers 7-19 has a heraldic emblem, possibly that of Sir Isaac Goldsmid, in its tympanum. The outermost buildings have full-height canted bays. Each storey is separated by a string-course across the full width of the building. The first-floor windows are arched and set forward slightly below an entablature and a central pediment. Straight-headed windows on the floor above are embellished with scrollwork, individual pediments and a bracketed entablature. At third-floor level, slightly round-headed windows are set in square recesses. At first-floor level, a cast iron balcony runs across the width of the building; it is supported by the Doric-columned porches in front of each entrance.
Number 33, the other end of the western section of Palmeira Mansions, is listed separately at Grade II* for its "outstanding" and "remarkable collection of fittings from the 1880s" (A.W. Mason bought the house in 1889, although the work may not have been completed until 1899). These include multicoloured marbled floors, staircases, handrails, panelling, columns and dado rails; lincrusta wallpaper; gilded ceilings in a Moorish style; stained glass in various styles; ostentatious chimneypieces, including one by Doulton and others with "riotous swirling motifs"; an overmantel made of Venetian glass; decorative light fittings depicting cherubim and serpents; ceramic tiles by Arts and Crafts designer Walter Crane; and a Rococo-style former ballroom.
Surrounding buildings.
Gwydyr Mansions is at the northeastern corner of the square, between Rochester Gardens and Holland Road. An opulent set of mansion flats designed by local firm Clayton & Black in 1890, it is in the Flemish Renaissance style and combines ashlar and red brick in its "busy" façade. The entrance has Classical elements, with Tuscan columns "in antis" beneath a pediment; elsewhere, there elaborate gables, turrets and canted bay and oriel windows.
Palmeira House, designed in 1887 by Thomas Lainson of Lainson & Sons, was that firm's first building for the Brighton & Hove Co-operative Supply Association. It is a "richly Italianate" stucco-clad office building. Opposite, Zephania King's ornate Tudor Revival-style branch building for the London and County Bank (now offices), with tall chimneys and gables, was completed in 1890.
St John the Baptist's Church, the Anglican church serving the area, was built between 1852 and 1854 to the design of William and Edward Habershon. The flint and ashlar building is Decorated Gothic Revival in style and has a later tower (built in the 1870s) topped with a tall stone broach spire. All of the large windows have tracery in the Decorated style. The entrance porch dates from 1906–07. The worship space was cut down in 1990–92 when part of the building was converted by architect Mark Hills into the "Cornerstone Community Centre". This required the addition of a tall steel-framed structure and a new glazed opening in the roof.

Buddenbrooks (film)

Buddenbrooks (German: "Die Buddenbrooks"), released also as Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family, is a 2008 German drama film directed by Heinrich Breloer, adapted from the novel of the same name by Thomas Mann. It stars Armin Mueller-Stahl as the family's patriarch Consul Jean Buddenbrook, Iris Berben as his wife Bethsy Buddenbrook, and Jessica Schwarz, Mark Waschke and August Diehl as their children Tony, Thomas and Christian Buddenbrook, respectively.
"Buddenbrooks" was released in Germany on 25 December 2008, and by July 2009 it was seen by more than 1.2million viewers. The film had its American premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival in June 2009. In 2010, it was released as a two–episode television miniseries, which was shown on the Arte on 23 and 24 December, and on the Das Erste on 27 and 28 December.
Plot.
"Buddenbrooks" portrays the decline of a wealthy merchant family of Lübeck, the Buddenbrooks, through three generations — Consul Johann "Jean" Buddenbrook (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and his wife Elisabeth "Bethsy" Buddenbrook (Iris Berben); their children Thomas (Mark Waschke), Christian (August Diehl) and Antonie "Tony" Buddenbrook (Jessica Schwarz); and Thomas' son Hanno (Raban Bieling).
Even though he dearly loves them, Consul Buddenbrook expects his children to subordinate their personal happiness to the welfare of the family firm. The first to learn this is Tony, who is married off to Bendix Grünlich (Justus von Dohnányi), a businessman from Hamburg. Her brothers have meanwhile learned the trade in Amsterdam and London. Crushed by Tony's marital disaster and several unlucky transactions, Jean Buddenbrook makes over the business to his eldest, Thomas. Thomas marries the Dutch heiress Gerda (Léa Bosco), a passionate violin player, although he does not love her. After having spent time in Valparaiso, Christian returns to Lübeck. Thomas soon learns that his brother is much more interested in the theatre and actress Aline (Nina Proll) than in the company, which causes a rift between the brothers. Seeing that she cannot heal it, their mother admonishes them to at least conceal it from society.
Home media.
"Buddenbrooks" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 11 September 2009.

Thomas Welton Stanford

Thomas Welton Stanford (1832 - 1918), also known as Welton Stanford, was an American-born Australian businessman, spiritualist and philanthropist, most notably toward Stanford University, which was founded by his older brother Leland Stanford. Although living most of his adult life in Australia, he kept his American citizenship and served intermittently as honorary American vice consul-general in Melbourne.
Thomas Welton Stanford was born in 1832 in Albany, New York, the youngest of six sons of Josiah Stanford, a public works contractor, and his wife Elizabeth, née Phillips. He was educated at Troy Conference Academy in Vermont. In 1852, he left for California, attracted by the California Gold Rush as were all of his brothers. They ran a store in the gold fields for a few years; by 1858 the brothers were running the largest oil company in the West. In December 1859, Thomas and his brother DeWitt Stanford moved to Melbourne. 
In Australia, he became a distributor for Singer sewing machines and rang up record sales, using innovative sales techniques such as time payment. By the time Singer stopped using independent distributors in the 1880s, Stanford was a wealthy man. He became increasingly reclusive after DeWitt's death and developed a strong interest in spiritualism. He founded the Victorian Association of Progressive Spiritualists, together with W. H. Terry and J. B. Motherwell, and sponsored many séances, becoming known as the "father of spiritualism in Australia".
He served on the board of trustees of Stanford University, which had been founded in 1891 as a memorial to Leland and Jane Stanford's only son Leland Stanford Jr., almost from its inception until his death. He was also a generous and frequent benefactor to the university. When he received a legacy from his brother Leland's will, he donated half of it ($300,000) to Stanford. He donated his books on Australia and his art collection to the university, and underwrote the construction of a library to house them. The Thomas Welton Stanford Library, built in 1900, was the university's main library until the completion of a new main library (now the Green Library) in 1919. His art collection formed the nucleus of the university's art department, and his contributions built the Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery on the campus, which was completed in 1917 and is still the art department's main gallery. Many of his donations to the university were earmarked for "psychical research", resulting in the publication of a 640-page volume called "Experiments in Psychical Research at Leland Stanford Junior University", published in 1917. At the insistence of university lawyers, his later donations were earmarked for "psychical research and related phenomena", which was interpreted to mean the entire psychology department; for several years his grants supplied almost the entire budget for the department.
He died August 28, 1918, at his home in East Melbourne, and left the bulk of his estate to Stanford University. His papers are housed in the university archives.

Clarrie Jordan (20 June 1922 – 24 February 1992) was an English professional footballer who played as a centre forward for Upton Colliery, Doncaster Rovers and Sheffield Wednesday. He holds the Doncaster record of 42 league goals scored in one season, and jointly holds the record of scoring in 10 consecutive games in the Football League.
Life and career.
Jordan started his football playing for Upton Colliery before joining Doncaster in April 1940.
Doncaster Rovers.
During the war years he scored 63 goals in 102 games for Rovers, plus he made guest appearances for Leeds United, Aldershot Town, Birmingham City and Derby County.
He made his full debut for Doncaster in the 3rd Division North on 31 August 1946, winning 2-1 at home against Rochdale. That season was to be record breaking for both Clarrie and Doncaster, as he took the still standing club record of goals scored in one season, and they got the most points for any club in a league of 22 teams and with the two points for a win system, also still standing. In that season he scored three hat-tricks and got a club and League record of scoring in ten consecutive games. Only John Aldridge and Jermain Defoe have equalled this feat in the Football League. 
The following season in the higher league he scored 6 in 19 league appearances.
Sheffield Wednesday.
In February 1948 he was sold to nearby Sheffield Wednesday scoring on his debut against Bradford Park Avenue. That first season he scored only 2 more goals in 14 further appearances. The following season he scored 14 in 33 games, and in the 1949-50 promotion season he netted 12 times in 26 games including 4 in a game against Hull.
Jordan struggled for the remainder of his footballing life with injury and loss of form though he did score 6 goals in 12 matches in the First Division in the 1953-54 season. The following season he played his final game on 18 September at Brammall Lane against Sheffield United.
Personal life.
In later life he was landlord of the Schoolboy Inn at Norton, Doncaster.

Whitrigg railway station

Whitrigg was a railway station on the Bowness Moss which served Whitrigg, a hamlet in Cumbria on the English side of the Solway Firth. The station opened on 8 August 1870 by the Caledonian Railway on a line constructed from the Caledonian Railway Main Line at Kirtlebridge across the Glasgow South Western Line, then forming the Solway Junction Railway over the Solway Viaduct to Brayton. The line opened in 1869, but freight had run from 13 September 1869.
History.
Whitrigg station was opened by the Solway Junction Railway, then part of the Caledonian Railway. At first the station was a 'flag' station or request stop with passengers wishing to alight informing the guard at Abbey Junction or Bowness, depending on their direction of travel. The gateman likewise signalled if a train was to stop. From 1 January 1873 a crossing keeper had been appointed appointed and the level crossing itself signalled. North of the station was a goods siding, worked by a frame which was controlled by train tablet for the section Bowness and Kirkbride Junction.
The passenger service was never very well patronised and reduced to being just one carriage at the front of an occasional goods train and in September 1917 this was suspended, but was reinstated in 1920. Passenger services were finally withdrawn in 1921 and the line south of Annan over the Solway Viaduct was closed completely.
The station had one platform with a simple wooden station building. The closure of the station was directly linked to the closure of the Solway viaduct.
Disused, the station became the property of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 until sold together with the viaduct.
Micro-history.
The first up goods train used to call at Whitrigg to attach livestock wagons.
The site today.
The station waiting room and platform have been demolished and a private dwelling has been built on the site.

"U-354" served with the 5th U-boat Flotilla, for training and then with the 1st flotilla for operations from 1 October 1942. She came under the command of the 11th flotilla on 15 October and was reassigned to the 13th flotilla on 1 June 1943; she stayed with that organization until her sinking.
"U-348" made short trips from Kiel in Germany to Bergen and Skjomenfjord in Norway between April and October 1942.
1st and 2nd patrols.
Her first patrol began with her departure from Skjomenfjord on 29 October 1942. On 4 November she sank the "William Clark" off Jan Mayen Island. This ship had already possibly been damaged by bombs from Ju 88 aircraft. A crewman was lost overboard on the 11th. The boat put into Narvik on the 30th.
The submarine's second foray over Christmas and New year's Eve took her from Narvik, as far as Bear Island and back to Narvik.
3rd and 4th patrols.
"U-354"s third patrol was marred by the suicide of "Maschinenmaat" Helmut Ricther on 12 March 1943.
Her fourth sortie took the boat north of Bear Island; she returned to Narvik on 12 June 1943.
5th patrol.
It was during this patrol that she attacked and damaged the Soviet "Petrovskij" in the eastern Kara Sea on 27 August 1943.
6th patrol.
This patrol was split in two: the first part, which was rather brief, was over 22 and 23 October 1943. The second part was longer; between 25 October and 6 December. The boat finished up in Hammerfest in the far north of Norway.
7th, 8th and 9th patrols.
"U-354" continued to patrol northern waters, without success.
10th patrol.
By now moored in Bogenbucht (west of Narvik), the next sally was also divided in two. The boat sailed west of Svalbad and Zemlya Frantsa-Josifa, (Franz Josef Land), but targets continued to elude her.
11th patrol and loss.
"U-354" sank with a torpedo intended as a 'coup de grǎce' for the escort carrier (which was subsequently declared to be a total loss), northwest of the North Cape on 22 August 1944.
The U-boat was sunk on 24 August by the British sloops and , the frigate and the destroyer .
Summary of raiding career.
Previously recorded fate.
"U-354" was originally thought to have been sunk by a Fairey Swordfish of No. 825 Naval Air Squadron from the escort carrier on 22 August 1944. This was .

Olympic Organ Builders

Olympic Organ Builders was an importer and custom fabricator of tracker action pipe organs in Seattle, Washington from 1962 through the 1970s. The company built approximately 25 organs for churches and schools located the Puget Sound and Eugene Oregon in the period from 1967 through 1970.
History.
The company was an informal partnership formed in 1962 of David P Dahl and Glenn D White Jr under the name ‘Olympic Organ Builders’ to import and install organs from Gebr. Späth Orgelbau, Detlef Kleuker, and Werner Bosch (all in Germany). They were joined by James R (Jim) Ludden in 1967 when the partnership was formalized. Ludden opened the construction shop located in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, in a building owned by White's father (Glenn Sr.), that had been a heating and sheet metal shop.
Dahl is an accomplished organist. He met Ludden while attending graduate school at University of Washington. Their first work together was revoicing the pipe organ at Trinity Methodist Church, Seattle, in 1962, which was celebrated by a concert featuring E. Power Biggs.
White was the principal sales person and helped with visual design. White also voiced and tuned the organs. Dahl helped with sales and tonal design. Ludden did the engineering and supervised the three to five employees.
Ludden trained as an organ builder in Germany in the shop of Detlef Kleuker, Brackwede (near Bielefeld), Germany, for a period of one year. Glenn trained as an acoustic engineer and was sound director at Seattle Center after working as a vibration engineer for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Dahl studied pipe organ at University of Washington and is now professor of organ at Pacific Lutheran University.
Prior to forming Olympic Organ Builders, White had been ordering custom pipe organs and installing these on his vacations. (White continued to import and install organs and modify old organs after the partnership dissolved in 1970.) He continued to work full time at Seattle Center.
The firm built mostly small organs. Their first work was a one-manual organ displayed at the Episcopal National Convention in St. Mark’s Cathedral, Seattle. Ludden's masterpiece (in its original meaning) is located in the suspended choir loft at University Unitarian Church. Many of the organs were two-manual (keyboard) plus pedal practice organs.
Employees included Beth Berry Barber, David O Ruberg, Barry Turley (now Fall River, MA), and Randall McCarty (deceased).
Construction effectively ended in 1970 when the partnership was formally dissolved after Boeing lost a large federal contract and the economy of Seattle fell into depression. Glenn continued to use the name when installing imported organs during the 1970s.
Organs Built in Seattle.
A search of the internet will provide more current results than could be recorded here, but will include work attributed to the firm that was either done by White after the shop was closed or installations prior to the shop opening.
Jude Frits carved pipe shades for several Olympic Organs
Organs Installed.
These were installed and voiced by Glenn White. David Dahl designed the stop list on most of these.
Organs built by Jim Ludden.
After the Seattle shop closed, Ludden moved to New England where he built two portable organs.

Pāvels Šteinbors

Pāvels Šteinbors (born 21 September 1985) is a Latvian football goalkeeper, currently playing for Górnik Zabrze in the Polish Ekstraklasa.
Club career.
As a youth player Šteinbors was a member of the Skonto Riga youth academy. He was taken to the first team in 2001. Even though he stayed in the club until 2004, due to high competition for the first keeper's place alongside that time Latvian international Andrejs Piedels, Šteinbors was unable to get a place in the usual starting line-up. In January 2004 Pāvels joined another Latvian Higher League club FK Jūrmala, where he could finally settle down. Youngster showed some high-class performances and was regarded as one of the most talanted Latvian youngsters. In December 2007 Šteinbors went on trial with the Football League Championship side Blackpool, impressing the coaching staff. On 16 January 2008 the German 2. Bundesliga club Augsburg reported that Šteinbors was on trial with them in their training camp in Faro, Portugal. However, on 31 January 2008 Pāvels signed a loan deal with Blackpool until the end of the 2007–08 season with an option to extend it for another year. The loan was then extended and Šteinbors joined his countryman and current Latvian international Kaspars Gorkšs at Bloomfield Road. During his loan spell Šteinbors regularly played in the reserve team, but didn't make an appearance for the first team. After the end of the loan contract player returned to the Latvian Higher League, moving to FK Liepājas Metalurgs in 2009. During the 2009 and 2010 seasons he was the back-up keeper for the team behind experienced Viktors Spole. In 2011 Šteinbors finally claimed the first keeper's place, showing great performance and being included in the "sportacents.com" team of the season. All in all he played 53 league matches for Metalurgs. On 15 July 2012 Šteinbors moved to the South African Premier Soccer League club Golden Arrows for the 2012–13 season. He started the season as the club's first keeper, but lost his place in the line-up in midseason, with the team struggling to show good results. In July 2013 Šteinbors moved to the Polish Ekstraklasa, signing a two-year contract with Górnik Zabrze after a successful trial period. He made his debut for the club on 17 August 2013 in a Polish Cup match against GKS Bełchatów, playing 90 minutes and keeping a clean-sheet.
International career.
In 2003 Šteinbors played for Latvia U-19 and in 2005 he was called up to the U-21 side. He is yet to make an international appearance for the senior team.

Gold Museum of Peru and Weapons of the World

In the sixties of the 20th century, Miguel Mujica Gallo, the result of the continuous increase in its private collection made throughout his life, created a foundation that bears his name and which manages the equally created by him, the "Gold Museum of Peru and weapons of the World", located in the district of Santiago de Surco, Lima, Peru.
The two-story building (12.1087S 76.9665W) that contains this collection is made of reinforced concrete and its entrance is through a vault-style large of a bank safe.
Donation to the State.
The museum, donated to the Peruvian state by his creator, Miguel Mujica Gallo is administered by the Foundation Miguel Mujica Gallo.
Currently, the Foundation is directed by Victoria Mujica Diez Canseco.
Gold of Peru.
The acquisition of the Peruvian contents, of more than seven thousand pieces, was inspired by the admiration for the history of Peru had this prominent collector in order to leave a legacy to this country of goldsmiths from ancient times, as homage to the Peruvian pre-Columbian cultures in its various manifestations containing materials such as precious metals like gold, silver and some of platinum, multiple textiles, ceramics, mummies, and other valuable objects of the time.
Thus prevented these valuable jewels were exported and cultural heritage lost forever, ending up in the hands of unscrupulous reducers or be disbanded after his death.
His pieces give an idea, in general, what the Spanish found when they came to this country, resulting in the encounter between two cultures, one that gave the most value to precious metals and the local that valorised the time in performing work or make an object, despite having precious metals used for religious, power status, as tools or as part of their clothing or attire.
Those works exhibited in the museum have been found mostly in the Republican era and acquired at the time by Miguel Mujica Gallo.
Through them, it has been known not only advances in metallurgy, customs, beliefs and life was like in those cultures.
The gold and silver coated magical complex religious symbolism in all Peruvian cultures. In the pre-Incas, these metals represented a constant duality sun-moon, day-night, male-female. In the Inca Empire, the sun god or Inti represented sovereignty on the divine plane and the moon goddess or Mama Moon, also known as Mama Quilla was Inti's wife, mother of the sky. In the Temple of the Sun an order of priestesses worshiped.
The forms that these metals acquired indicated the seniority and power of those who used it in his life and the importance that they won in their burials.
The ancient Peruvians developed techniques unknown to Europeans, such as to color to metal surfaces golding or silvering.
All pre-Incan cultures were goldsmiths of these metals, but only four of them stood out at the highest level.
In this classification include the cultures Vicus, Moche, Sican and Chimu that it developed on the northern coast of Peru.
Subsequent to these cultures, emerges the Inca Empire that is richer in possession of metal objects in gold and silver and the quality and finesse of its finished.
Victoria Mujica, referring to historical documents found in the Archive of the Indies, cites one that says:
Weapons of the World.
Proceeds from his numerous travels abroad, Miguel Mujica Gallo was also collecting different weapons in the world, the oldest dating from the 13th century. C. He was a regular buyer in all major auctions where any.
"Twenty thousand weapons of all times and countries are exhibited in the museum", than for quantity, quality, superb condition and the famous original holders of these parts can be considered one of the world's foremost in this specialty, product of the efforts of private collectors of the founder of this museum.
In its environments, as well as weapons, can be seen war uniforms, horse saddles, armor, spurs and other objects that define the early through time and characters of history for more than three thousand and three hundred years.

William B. Brown

William Burbridge Brown (10 September 1912, in Chillicothe, Ohio – 24 December 1985), was a lawyer who served a variety of positions in the Territory of Hawaii from 1943 to 1955, before returning to serve on the Ohio District Courts of Appeals and Ohio Supreme Court from 1960 to 1984.
William Burbridge Brown was born to Mabel R. Downs Brown and Dr. Henry Renick Brown. He attended the Chillicothe public schools, received a bachelors degree from Williams College in 1934, and a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1937. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1938, and practiced that year in Toledo, before returning to Chillicothe in 1939 at the firm "Simpson and Brown".
Brown left Chillicothe in 1942 to work in Washington, D.C. as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration. He transferred to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1943, and worked for the Office of Price Administration there until 1946. In 1946, President Harry Truman appointed Brown to the Territory of Hawaii Court of Tax Appeals, and in 1947, Truman appointed him Hawaii Territory Treasurer. In 1951, the President appointed him to the Second Circuit Court for the Territory of Hawaii.
Brown returned to Chillicothe in 1955, and practiced privately for a year. In 1956, he began a four-year term as Chillicothi Municipal Court Judge. In 1960, he won a seat on the 4th District Courts of Appeals of Ohio. He was the first Democrat elected to a seat in the 4th District.
In 1972, Brown defeated incumbent Republican justice Louis J. Schneider Jr. for a six-year term on the Ohio Supreme Court. In 1978, he won another term. In 1984, Brown was already more than seventy years old, and was prohibited by state law from running for another term. His term ended December 31, 1984.
William B. Brown married Jayne Stone on August 18, 1943. They had two children. The couple planned to travel in retirement, but William B. Brown suffered a fatal stroke as a consequence of brain cancer. His funeral was at St. Paul Episcopal Church in Chillicothe, and he was buried at Grandview Cemetery. 
After Brown's death, justice J. Craig Wright said : “He was one of the best legal minds we’ve had on the court in the last twenty years. He was a forward-looking person. He kept the best of the past in his decisions along with the best of what we have now. I admired him.”

Rhabdias bufonis

Rhabdias bufonis is a species of parasitic nematode in the family Rhabdiasidae. It was first described from the lungs of the European common toad ("Bufo bufo") but has also been found in a number of other species of frog.
Life cycle.
"Rhabdias bufonis" has a heterogonic lifestyle in which a generation of parasitic individuals is succeeded by a free-living generation. This is advantageous to the parasite as it allows reproduction for one or more generations in the absence of the host. The free-living male and female worms mate and produce eggs which hatch inside the mother. They feed on her internal organs and moult twice before they leave her body. They are now infective larvae and can penetrate the skin of a frog. Once inside, they can migrate to the lungs and further develop there, feeding on the lung tissue. The adult parasitic worm is a hermaphrodite and grows to be about ten times the length of the free-living form. The eggs it produces are coughed into the frog's mouth, are swallowed and develop in its intestine. They are passed in the feces and develop into free-living forms. In the soil, the worms feed on bacteria and other organic matter. The female may produce a pheromone to attract a male. 
Parasitism.
"Rhabdias bufonis" is found in the parts of Europe and Asia in which its host frogs are found. Besides the common toad from which this roundworm was first described, it has been found in the common spadefoot toad ("Pelobates fuscus"), the common frog ("Rana temporaria"), the moor frog ("Rana arvalis"), the agile frog ("Rana dalmatina"), the European fire-bellied toad ("Bombina bombina"), the yellow-bellied toad ("Bombina variegata"), water frogs ("Pelophylax spp.") and the European green toad ("Bufo viridis").
Juvenile frogs are often infected and a heavy worm burden can seriously restrict their growth. In a study, some of the infected juveniles were only half as heavy as controls with no worms. The parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some of the young host frogs died.

Stripping of the Altar

The Stripping of the Altar is a ceremony carried out in the earlier form of the Roman Rite at the end of Mass of the Lord's Supper on Maundy Thursday. It is still carried out in many Anglican and Lutheran churches on Maundy Thursday. All altars in the church, except for the Altar of Repose, are stripped.
In the present form of the Roman Rite, as revised in 1955, there is no ceremony of stripping the altar. At a suitable time after the Mass the altar is stripped, usually by the sacristan, and crosses are removed from the church, if possible. There is no Mass on Good Friday or Holy Saturday, the next one being that of the Easter Vigil. On Good Friday, a white cloth is placed on the altar for the last part of the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord, after the conclusion of which the altar is stripped, again privately, except that the Cross remains on the altar with two or four candlesticks.
The form of the Roman Rite in use immediately before the reform of the Easter Triduum ceremonies by Pope Pius XII in 1955 had a formal ceremony of stripping the altar as a conclusion of the Holy Thursday Mass, which was then celebrated in the morning. After removing the ciborium from the high altar to the altar of repose, the priest, accompanied by the other ministers, went to the sacristy, where he took off his white Mass vestments and donned a violet stole. Then, with the other ministers, he removed the altarcloths, vases of flowers, antependium and all other ornaments then customarily placed on the altar. Unlike present usage, the altar cross and candlesticks were left on the altar. This was done to the accompaniment of Psalm 21 (Vulgate) (Deus, Deus meus) preceded and followed by the antiphon "Diviserunt sibi vestimenta mea: et super vestem meam miserunt sortem" (They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment).
In earlier centuries, the altars were in some churches washed with a bunch of hyssop dipped in wine and water. Augustine Joseph Schulte says that this was done "to render them in some manner worthy of the Lamb without stain who is immolated on them, and to recall to the minds of the faithful with how great purity they should assist at the Holy Sacrifice and receive Holy Communion." He adds that the ceremony was intended as homage offered to Jesus in return for his humbly washing the feet of his disciples, the ceremonial commemoration of which was, before 1955, carried out separately from the Mass and stripping of the altar
Eamonn Duffy alluded to this ceremony in The Stripping of the Altars a history of popular religion in pre-Reformation England.

Spunti e ricerche

Spunti e ricerche is an annual peer-reviewed academic journal that covers research in Italian studies. Individual volumes often consist of articles on a broadly defined theme, on a particular writer, or on various subjects. The editors-in-Chief are Raffaele Lampugnani (Monash University), Annamaria Pagliaro (Monash University), Antonio Pagliaro (La Trobe University), Carolyn James (Monash University), and Nicole Prunster (La Trobe University). Although other Australian journals pre-dated "Spunti e ricerche", such as the now defunct "Altro Polo" (1978-1996), "Spunti e ricerche" is the oldest active academic journal in Australia specifically devoted to Italian studies.
History.
"Spunti e ricerche" was the brain child of a number of tutors from the Italian Department of the University of Melbourne in 1981-1982 and the first volume appeared 1985. It was intended to foster, increase, and diversify Australian research and enquiry into Italian studies, specifically in the fields of Italian literature, politics, linguistics, history, society, cinema, and art, but also had the broad aim to encourage manifestations of the culture by Italians, or about Italians, in Australia.

<doc id="36825898" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36825898" title="Type 052D destroyer">
Type 052D destroyer

The Type 052D destroyer (NATO code name Luyang III class, or Kunming class after the lead ship) is a class of guided missile destroyers being deployed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy.
After the Type 052C destroyer (NATO code name "Luyang II" class, or "Lanzhou" class after the lead ship), two new hulls were spotted under construction at Changxingdao-Jiangnan Shipyard (JNCX) in August 2012. According to the picture, they were armed with a new 130mm main gun and new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar system. Altogether six vessels of this class are now fitting out or under construction, with a further four on order or planned, one vessel on sea trial and one vessel active.
Design.
The layout of the Type 052D is similar to the earlier Type 052C, but the superstructure of the Type 052D slopes inward at a greater angle, providing superior stealth. The helicopter hangar on the Type 052D is moved to the center, as opposed to being on the left like on the Type 052C. A pair of enclosed boat/raft launching systems similar to that of the Type 054A frigate is added, with one on each side of the helicopter hangar. The Type 517HA VHF radar mast is moved toward the stern of the ship. There are several mounting sites for a new single barrel 30 mm stealthy gun mount that is fully automated. The addition of this small caliber weapon is presumably for the need to counter non-conventional threats such as potential terrorist attacks and anti-piracy operations, but as of the end of 2012, no 30mm gun mounts have been observed to be installed on the hull yet.
Due to the greater angle of superstructure slope, more space was made available for the active phased array radar (APAR), which first appeared in June 2012 onboard PLAN experimental ship "Bi Sheng". It is believed that this new APAR is a development of Type 348 Radar mounted on the Type 052C. One of the main differences is that the size of the new array is larger, so presumably there are more transceivers on each array. Another obvious difference is that the curvature resulted in the need for air circulation on earlier APAR on Type 052C is gone, so it is believed that the new APAR on Type 052D must have adopted a pure liquid cooling system instead of the mixed air and liquid cooling system on earlier APAR on board Type 052C.
Vertical Launching System.
The Type 052D has a brand new vertical launching system (VLS) for surface-to-air missiles, cruise missiles, anti-submarine missiles, and anti-ship missiles, and is capable of quad-packing missiles and cold launch; it is the third type of Chinese VLS system identified, after the circular version of VLS on Type 052C destroyer and the rectangular version on Type 054A frigate. The VLS system on Type 052D differs from that on Type 052C. The circular-shaped VLS system on Type 052C is replaced by the VLS with rectangular cells on Type 052D. Moreover, this western-like VLS looks different from the VLS system of Type 054A. Photo shows that Type 052D's VLS system does not contain the shared exhaust vents between the rows of launching tubes, which is the common feature of Type 054A's VLS. Instead, the VLS on Type 052D looks more similar to the American Mk 41 VLS, but without obvious indication of exhausts. The lack of exhaust vents in the leaked photos leads to some Chinese internet forums postulating the cold launch method is adopted on Type 052D, but such claims cannot be confirmed by independent or official sources.
There are many other Chinese internet forums claiming that the difference between the VLS on Type 052D and VLS on Type 054A is simply a rearrangement of exhaust to a different location and Type 052D is still utilizing the hot launch method like Type 054A, but used a more advanced method of concentric canister launch (CCL) system (同心筒式垂直发射系统), first pioneered by USA in the mid-1990 for Mk 41 VLS upgrade. This second claim appears more probable than the cold launch claims, because official Chinese sources have confirmed the existence of CCL VLS developmental program headed by the School of Mechatronics Engineering of Beijing Institute of Technology, and various research papers have been publicized, such as the effect of the flow mechanism and annular size of CCL and others. It's reported that chief designers of Chinese CCL VLS included Professor Yuan Zenfeng (袁曾凤), Professor Miao Peiyun (苗佩云) and professor Liang Shijie (梁世杰). When using CCL method, the flame produced in hot launch is diverted through the space between the inner and outer canisters within each individual VLS cell, so no specially dedicated exhaust shared by several cells are needed, thus similar to how British vertical launched (VL) Sea Wolf missile operates, and this is why CCL VLS can be mistaken for cold launch due to the lack of dedicated exhaust sandwiched between two rolls of cells in traditional VLS, while in reality, the exhaust of CCL VLS is within each individual cell.
What is also confirmed by semi-official sources in China is that the VLS on Type 052D is built to GJB 5860-2006 standard (GJB = Guo-jia Jun-yong Biao-zhun, 国家军用标准, "National Military Standard"), so that different types of missiles can be launched by a single launching system. According to some of the publicized examples of GJB 5860-2006 requirement, there are 3 types of VLS that differs in length: 9 meter, 7 meter and 3.3 meter respectively (section 5.1.3), but the diameter is same for all, 850 mm maximum (section 6.1.2), with each launching tube filled with either dry air or nitrogen inside (section 6.1.4), and with higher internal pressure. (section 6.1.4). Similar to U.S. Navy's MK 41, a launching module includes 8 launching tubes (section 5.2.4), and each tube can house 1~4 missiles (section 5.2.4). Each launching model has a launching control unit (section 5.3.7), which can simultaneously launch up to 4 missiles of different kind (section 5.3.6). The launching control unit must have build-in test/diagnostic function (section 5.3.8). These publicized portions of GJB 5860-2006 are surprisingly similar to that of Mk 41 VLS, which prompt some Chinese internet sources to claim that there are potential future export of such system so that it has to comply to Mk 41 VLS, the most widely used VLS in the world.
Naval Gun.
Another improvement of the Type 052D is that the Type H/PJ87 100 mm gun on the Type 052C is replaced by a new single barrel 130 mm gun, designated as the Type H/PJ38.
Data Link.
Various Chinese internet sources have claimed that Type 052D is equipped with a newest Chinese data link which has just completed national certification in Jun 2012 and publicized by the end of year. Designated as JSIDLS (Joint Service Integrated Data Link System, 全军综合数据链系统), this is the Chinese equivalent of Link 16, a significant improvement of earlier HN-900 which is the Chinese equivalent of Link 11/TADIL-A installed on Type 052C. The general designer of JSIDLS is Major General Wang Jianxi (王建新), who was the also head of the research institute of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department assigned as primary contractor of JSIDLS. More than 300 establishments and 8000 people were involved in the development of JSIDLS, and it won State Science and Technology Prizes after completion.
Chinese "Aegis".
Chinese media informally designate the Type 052D as "Zhonghuashendun / 中华神盾" which means "Chinese Aegis". The new destroyer is equipped with a flat-array AESA radar, a 64-cell VLS and modern long-range anti-air missiles. The destroyer is expected to have capabilities similar to those of a U.S. Navy "Arleigh Burke"-class destroyer.
There is speculation that the radar systems on Type 052D destroyers are able to detect stealth fighter aircraft, particularly the American F-35 Lightning II. Russian sources claim the ship's AESA radar can detect, track, and launch weapons against the F-35 at a range of . The range may be exaggerated, given the ship's HQ-9B SAMs have an estimated effective range of only , but it may be capable of detecting the F-35 if the Type 346 radar is an S-band radar like the American SPY-1 radar. Tactical stealth fighters are optimized to be undetectable from higher-frequency radar bands such the C, X, and Ku, but features like the tail-fin may make it susceptible to lower S or L-band frequencies. Even so, much depends on the distance between the ship and aircraft and the strength of the return of the omni-directional signal, meaning a target may not be picked up at a tactically significant distance. L-band and most S-bands have resolution cells that cannot generate quality targets for weapons tracking, even if it is detected. However, the SPY-1 and Air and Missile Defense Radar operate in higher frequency portions of the S-band and are able to generate weapons quality tracks, so Chinese systems could be similar. China is also suspected to be reducing the size of the large radar resolution cells by connecting multiple low-frequency radars through high-speed data-networks, which has the potential to refine resolution enough for tracking a missile to the target.

Dating from at least the 17th century, it was originally worn only in the royal court, but nowadays is most recognisable as the form of academic dress employed by many universities, especially Chulalongkorn University.
History.
The exact origins of the "khrui" are not known, although it has been postulated that it was likely of Persian and/or Indian import. The earliest documentation of its use are from illustrations of the French embassy to King Narai in 1685 and that of Siam to France in 1686, showing the Siamese king and ambassadors wearing such garments. Use of the "khrui" continued into the Rattanakosin period, as evidenced by mention in the 1804 Law of Three Seals prohibiting its use by junior government officials.
King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) further codified the "khrui"'s use by royal ordinance in 1912, specifying the different types and ranks to be worn by entitled royals and government officials. He later also granted permission for it to be used as the academic dress of the Royal Pages School (Vajiravudh College) in 1913 and Siam's Bar Association in 1915. It was adopted as the academic dress for graduates of Chulalongkorn University in 1930. Since 1967, some other universities have also adopted the "khrui" as their academic regalia, and the term "khrui" have acquired the more general meaning of any style of academic or court dress.
Appearance.
The "khrui" is a tailored robe, usually knee-to-calf-length, with long sleeves and an open front. It is made of a sheer or mesh fabric, usually white in colour, giving it a translucent appearance. The entire rim and the ends of the sleeves are lined with bands of a thicker material, usually satin, felt, or a substitute, with another like pair of bands encircling the sleeves above elbow level. When used as academic dress, these bands usually bear specific patterns denoting the wearer's affiliated institution and academic degree. When used in ceremonial settings by senior government officials or royalty, the gown may be embroidered with certain patterns of goldwork depending on the rank of the wearer. "Khrui" used as royal attire differ further in certain details, and may be made of coloured or gold cloth.
Use.
"Khrui" traditionally denoted royal or noble status, and was worn only by men. Members of the royal family would first use it during their "sokan" (topknot-cutting) ceremony. The king would wear it on special occasions such as his coronation, royal processions or when receiving special audiences. Its use by "nak"—novices preparing to undergo upasampada (Buddhist ordination)—is the only occasion where the "khrui" is worn regardless of a person's social rank.
According to the 1912 ordinance, persons may be entitled to wear "khrui" through rank, office, or further royal permission. Entitled ranks include Grand Companions and above of the Order of Chula Chom Klao and Knight Commanders and above of the Orders of the White Elephant or the Crown of Thailand. Judges may wear it during full dress royal ceremonies; other government officials may wear it during such ceremonies if they are performing certain addresses, or if it has been specified for the occasion. Such occasions are nowadays rare, though the "khrui" is still seen in the ceremonial costumes worn during the annual Royal Ploughing Ceremony and occasional royal processions.
Today, the "khrui" is most readily identified as the academic dress of several Thai universities, Chulalongkorn University being its oldest and most prominent adopter. It is worn without a cap, over the university's dress uniform (usually a raj pattern jacket and white trousers for males, white blouse and navy skirt for females) for undergraduate degrees, or a suit and tie for graduate degrees. Like most of its counterparts, it use in this form is usually seen only during graduation ceremonies.

Critical reception.
David Crawford of the "Radio Times" criticized the first episode for its short length and "lightly sketched" coverage of science, but wrote that it is "full of arresting images". A similar criticism was made by Jonathan Wright in "The Guardian", who stated that the first episode is "far too short at 30 minutes and thus skims over some subjects". Crawford writes that the fifth episode, like the first, "packs a lot of information into its short running time," and praised the final episode on Svalbard, likening it to a " mini-episode of "Frozen Planet"" filled with "jaw-dropping, eye-covering scenes". "The Guardian"'s Martin Skegg was more positive on the length of the final episode, writing that "relaying the complex interplay of life in just 30 minutes, the film is a punchy antidote to the sometimes bloated 'event' nature".

LNER class D41

The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) D41 class is a type of 4-4-0 steam locomotive inherited from the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR). The class consisted of two similar GNSR classes: 'S' (introduced in 1893 and designed by James Johnson and 'T' (introduced in 1895 and designed by William Pickersgill. The two classes were similar but with detail differences to the boiler.
Construction history.
Class S.
In December 1893 six locomotives were supplied by Neilson (works nos. 4640-4646) and were numbered 78-83.
Class T.
Between December 1895 and February 1898 a further twenty six locomotives were supplied by Neilson works nos. 4877-90 and 5212-23, fitted with a larger boiler. Nine of these had been reboilered between 1916 and 1923, making them indistinguishable from the 'S' class, and the remainder were similarly reboilered by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER)after 1923. The LNER therefore treated them all as a single class, 'D41'.
The first locomotive was withdrawn in 1947.
British Railways.
Eighteen of the 21 locomotives passed into British Railways ownership in 1948 (eleven former class V, and seven former class F). BR renumbered them by adding 60000 to their 1946 LNER number.
The last locomotives were withdrawn in 1946, and survivors lasted until 1953.

American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians

The American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians (AOBFP) is an organization that provides board certification to qualified osteopathic physicians (D.O.) who specialize in delivering comprehensive primary care for patients of all ages, genders, and addressing all parts of the body (family physicians). The board is one 18 medical specialty certifying boards of the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists approved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and was established in 1972. As of April 2012, 6,344 osteopathic family physicians held active certification with the AOBFP.
Board certification.
Initial certification is available to osteopathic family physicians who have successfully completed an AOA-approved residency in family medicine, two years of practice, successful completion of written and oral exams, and chart review. 
Voluntary recertification was first offered in Fall 1994, and mandatory recertification began in March 1997. Before this time, the initial board certification was permanent and recertification was not required. Since March 1997, if a physician does not recertify every eight years, their board certification status expires.
Osteopathic family physicians may also receive Certification of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in the following areas: 
The Certification of Added Qualifications must be maintained through the process of recertification every 10 years. 
For an osteopathic physician to be board-certified in any specialty, they must be AOA members, pay certification fees, and complete at least 120 hours of continuing medical education in a three-year period.

Władysław Machejek

Władysław Machejek (February 25, 1920 – December 21, 1991) was a communist official, an aspiring writer and hoax artist during the Stalinist reign of terror in Poland following World War II. He wrote fabricated accounts of anti-communist underground mainly for his own political gains as regional party secretary and later member of the communist highest parliamentary echelons. Due to the coarse and infamous nature of his works, he has been described as a "legendary socialist scribbler".
Biography.
Machejek was born on February 25, 1920 into a peasant family in the hamlet of Chodów. He joined the Communist Party of Poland as a youth. During World War II he served in the Soviet-sponsored partisan organizations Gwardia Ludowa and Armia Ludowa. After the war he became a member of the new Polish communist party PZPR and took over the post of its regional secretary in the town of Nowy Targ not far from where he grew up. Soon, he became a member of the provincial party cell in Kraków, and eventually deputy to the Sejm (Polish parliament) in the People's Republic of Poland. He was selected editor-in-chief of "Życie Literackie" magazine under Stalinism (1952) and became a prolific writer of ideological propaganda and coarse, often embarrassing polemics supporting the communist party line. He has also been known on occasion to attack the authorities of other communist countries (such as Romania), but his criticism was tolerated. It is said he always carried a bottle of vodka in his hollow briefcase. Machejek died in Kraków at the age of 71 shortly after the collapse of the communist regime in the People's Republic, and the re-emergence of sovereign Polish state in the Autumn of Nations.
Works.
Machejek was a political hack writer. His most infamous book "Rano przeszedł huragan" ("In the Morning There Came A Hurricane") published in 1955 presented purported crimes in the Podhale region committed by the "Ogniowcy" partisan units under Józef Kuraś. The book was based on a fictional diary of their leader written by Machejek himself. In an often "coarse" and even "primitive" prose, Machejek painted Poland's anti-communists as motley crew of bloodthirsty anti-Semites who killed Jews, persecuted the Slovak population of the region and who preyed on innocent people. Although those fragments were simply invented by Machejek, some historians, most recently Jan Tomasz Gross in his "" (2006), have fallen for his claim that the novel was based on facts (Kuraś himself was hunted to death by secret police), thus treating Machejek's falsehood as a valid source.

Basil William Spalding

Basil W. Spalding (December 11, 1846 – 1929) was a Confederate Civil War veteran and tobacco farmer who lived in Charles County, Maryland. He was born at Pleasant Hill Plantation, which had been in his family for two hundred years and died at Green Park nearby. A native of Maryland, Spalding fought from 1862-1865 in the American Civil War in the name of the Confederacy after escaping from school to join "the Great Adventure".
After returning to his home state, he married and took on a simple lifestyle as a father to his children, husband to his wife, and a farmer. He married twice and had ten children. Spalding Died in 1929. He was a Catholic.
Early life.
Basil Spalding was born on December 11, 1846 to John Spalding, a slave-holding tobacco plantation owner and his second wife, Mary Carroll, a great-granddaughter of Daniel Carroll, a Founding Father of the United States. Very shortly after Spalding's birth, however, Mary Carroll died.
When he was two years old, his father, John Spalding, also died. An orphan, Spalding was taken into the care of his relative, William Fendley Dement, a Charles County plantation owner. Dement's wife, Mary Teresa Symphronia Green, was John Spalding's sister and therefore Spalding's aunt.
At the Dement's plantation, Eutaw, Spalding was raised by Mary Teresa as a son. Later, as a young adult, Spalding left to attend a private academy in northern Maryland.
The Civil War.
In early 1861, tensions between North and South were high, and war seemed imminent. Although Maryland officially remained in the Union upon the outbreak of the Civil War, support for the Union was not all that common. The prominent Dements, like many Southern Maryland families at the time whose lifestyle was dependent on slavery, had much at risk. Ardent supporters of slavery, the Charles County elite vehemently opposed Abraham Lincoln as President and when the Confederate States of America was founded, Charles County took its side. Charles County even requested the immediate secession of the state of Maryland.
In June 1861, William F. Dement and one of his servants left Eutaw and crossed the Potomac into Virginia to join the Confederate Army. He founded an artillery battery, known as Dement's First Maryland Battery.
In 1862, with the war raging on, Spalding, only seventeen years old, became determined to fight against what he viewed as Northern aggression and one day, he escaped from school by jumping out the window to take up arms against the Union. He joined a notorious guerrilla force known as McNeill's Rangers, a 210 man battalion-size unit that was known for its brazen attacks, unpredictable behavior and relentless raids. It operated mainly in the western counties of Virginia and West Virginia.
Spalding took part in McNeill's numerous raids on Piedmont, West Virginia, and Cumberland, Maryland, which were aimed at destroying the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad service. The raids severely damaged supply routes for the Union forces and hindered their forces ability to wage war. As McNeill's Rangers used horses for swift mobility and had no known base, they caused such extensive damage that more than 25,000 troops were dispatched by Federal commanders to guard the B&O against them.
Later life and death.
Spalding lived a simple life after the war. He lived at Pleasant Hill and raised his children there. After his second wife died in 1909, he took care of his youngest son, Francis Philip, who was only thirteen at the time.
In 1911, Pleasant Hill, which had been in the Spalding Family for generations and was originally part of Green's Inheritance, was sold.
Spading then lived in Green Park, where he died in 1929 after an illness of about a month.
Marriage and family.
Spalding married first Elizabeth Dement (1844–1880), William Fendley Dement's sister, in 1871. After she died, he married again. This time being his cousin, Francis B. Green's daughter, Mary Ann Elizabeth Green. She died in 1909 and Basil never remarried.
He outlived his second wife by twenty years.
Issue.
All of Spalding's children were born at his plantation, Pleasant Hill, in Pomfret, Charles County, Maryland.
Spalding and Elizabeth Dement had four children: John Carroll, Mary Genevieve, Anna Mary, and Louis Joseph. One month after Louis's birth, Elizabeth Dement died, leaving Basil a single parent of four children, all under the age of 10.
A few years later, Spalding married Mary Ann Elizabeth Green, his cousin's daughter. By Mary Ann, Basil had six children (four girls and two boys), but only four of them lived into adulthood.
They were: Bernard William Green; Mary Louise Cecelia; Marie Leola; twins Mary Elizabeth & Mary Helen; and Francis Philip.

<doc id="36826031" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36826031" title="Guy Martel">
Guy Martel

Guy Martel is a French spree killer who killed seven people and wounded at least five others in several towns and villages in the departments Ille-et-Vilaine and Cotes-du-Nord on June 19, 1985, before he was arrested.
Life.
Martel was born in Paris. His father Victor was a member of the garde mobile, and he had three sisters. Martel earned a degree in mathematics and chemistry, joined the military and was sent to Costa Rica, where he taught in San José. He rarely spoke about his time there, but he related that he had seen horrible things and had to perform the duties of someone of higher rank, who had been killed. In 1969 he had been taken hostage by guerrilleros, or bandits for three weeks and upon his release he was flown back to France. From then on he complained about being ill, saying he had caught a virus and suffered from intestinal pain and pain in the spine.
Martel accepted a position as a natural sciences teacher at Henri Matisse college in Issy-les-Moulineaux, but in 1972, after less than two years, he had to quit due to a nervous disorder and was put on a long term disability leave. Afterwards he had briefly been in mental institutions three times – once in Paris, and twice in Brittany – and was accorded a degree of disability of 80%. In 1975 he was granted a disability pension and moved in with his parents in Baguer-Morvan. When his mother died from a heart attack in 1976 his condition began to deteriorate and he saw hostility everywhere. Due to a growing discord between him and his father he decided to live alone and bought a house in Dol-de-Bretagne in 1979.
Once there Martel rarely left his home except to lie in his garden, or to play tennis at a local sports hall. He also ate lunch every day at a home for elderly people. Besides his father and an uncle, who occasionally came over to mow his lawn, as well as his doctor, Mr. Launay, he had no visitors and consequently was known as "monsieur tout seul" (Mr. all alone) throughout the village.
Martel generally was quickly fatigued and he complained a lot about noise, especially those made by children, whom he called loud and annoying. When one day a child pressed his doorbell and ran away he came out angrily, shouting: "If you do that again, I will kill you!"
It was also reported that Martel had been under treatment for mental problems in a hospital near Rennes since 1984.
Shooting.
On June 19, at about 10 a.m. Martel's father came to visit him and apparently they had some sort of argument. After his father had left, Martel took his .22-caliber rifle with scope, which he had purchased about ten years prior from Manufrance, as well as a box of cartridges, put them in the trunk of his car and drove to the house of his father in Baguer-Morvan.
Since his father was not yet home Martel drove back to Dol-de-Bretagne, where he arrived at approximately 11 a.m. at the home of his uncle, 64-year-old Charles Martel, who was picking cherries. Martel first had a normal conversation with him, but eventually returned to his car, retrieved his rifle and shot Charles Martel three times, wounding him, and also shot at, but missed one of his cousins.
Martel then drove to the retirement home where he entered the kitchen. When the cook, Mrs. Lozac'h, who was standing at the stove, explained that it was not yet time to eat, he replied that he would come back later (Je reviendrai tout à l'heure.) and shot at her, grazing her head. Martel left again and proceeded to doctor Launay's office. There he entered the room of Launay's colleague, Michel Lhommelet, who was examining a child, and killed him with four shots to the back. He next stopped at the gymnasium, where he used to play tennis, entered the office of Mrs. Le Maréchal, who was managing the facility, and shot her dead. 
Thereupon Martel returned to Baguer-Morvan, finding his father just arriving at his home. Martel killed him outside his house by shooting him several times. By that time reports of the loose gunman had spread in Dol-de-Bretagne, and shops were closed and children kept at school, while police began their search operation.
Meanwhile the 41-year-old made his way to Rocher-Aoustin near Combourg, where he killed Joseph Weber, also an uncle of his, with a shot from his rifle. In La Chapelle-aux-Filtzméens Martel shot at the brothers Jean and Eugène Chaussonnière, killing the former and seriously wounding the latter, while in Saint-Domineuc Pierre Bourtourault was shot dead when gathering hay at the roadside. In Quebriac he killed 33-year-old Danièle Pomard, whose body was found at 13:35 by garbage collectors. 
Near Trévérien Martel shot and wounded 29-year-old André Rehault on his tractor. At that time he was eventually spotted by a police helicopter and he left Ille-et-Vilaine and drove into Cotes-du-Nord, wounding on his way 34-year-old Daniel Lebreton, who was eating lunch in his truck near Saint-Judoce, and 40-year-old Raymond Prechoux in Saint-Juvat. Martel afterwards fired at three other persons before finally being stopped by police in Saint-André-des-Eaux at around 14:00. He stepped out of his car, hands raised and yelling: "Don't shoot! I am sick!" (Ne tirez pas! Je suis malade!) and was arrested.
Being asked about the reason for him shooting people at random he explained that at first he had business with his family and a few others, but upon realizing that it was easy to shoot people, he simply continued. (Au début, je n'avais affaire qu'à ma famille et a quelques autres personnes... Après, j'ai réalise que c'était facile de tirer. Alors, j'ai continue.)

Siphopteron quadrispinosum

Siphopteron quadrispinosum is a species of small sea slug, a marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusc in the order Cephalaspidea, the headshield slugs. This slug is a simultaneous hermaphrodite. 
Distribution.
This species was originally identified in Hawaii (Kihei, Maui) and Papua New Guinea, and has a wide distribution throughout the western and central Pacific Ocean.
Description.
"Siphopteron quadrispinosum" is a relatively small species of sea slug, growing to a maximum length of 5 mm. The body is bright yellow, and the siphon is orange-red in colour. The parapodia and siphon differ between the Papua New Guinean and Haiwaiian populations. Papua New Guinean specimens have the colouration of the siphon continuing along the posterior shield. Also, the parapodia are entirely yellow. In Hawaiian populations, the parapodia have a white margin and the orange-red colouration along the posterior shield is absent.
Eggs of this species are pale yellow and are laid in a flattened mass.
Habitat.
"Siphopteron quadrispinosum" is lives at depths of depth of 6 to 27 metres on sand beds, and among "Halimeda kanaloana", a species of macroalgae.
Behaviour.
This slug can swim, and will do so when disturbed. It is active during the daytime.
Mating.
"Siphopteron quadrispinosum" is a simultaneous hermaphrodite. During mating, each animal will stab the other with a penile stylet, a form of penile appendage, and injects prostate fluids.

Autolite 4300 carburetor

The Autolite 4300 was a Ford (also used by AMC) carburetor manufactured from 1967 through 1974. These carburetors were produced as an emissions-compliant replacement for the previous Autolite 4100 model, and were later superseded by the Motorcraft 4350.
Both the 4300A and 4300D are unique by virtue of having spread bore throttle plate designs (the 4300A being much less pronounced than the 4300D) that are unique to these carburetors and their relative intake mainfolds.
Variations.
4300A, 441 CFM (1967-1969).
The first version of this carburetor was released in 1967, replacing the 4100 on all Fords excluding the police package 428 CID and 289 CID high-output engines.
4300A 441 CFM specs:
The 441 CFM carburetor was found to run too lean for the 390 CID engines; hence, the 600 CFM 4300A was developed the following year for these larger applications. The 441 CFM 4300A was discontinued after the 1969 model year in favor of the two-barrel Autolite 2100 carburetor.
4300A, 600 CFM (1968-1974).
Due to the limited flow of the 441 CFM version of the 4300A, a 600 CFM version of the same was released in 1968. By 1970, it was factory supplied on most Fords equipped with the 429 and 460, in addition to vehicles with the 351 Cleveland.
4300A 600 CFM specs:
4300D, 715 CFM spreadbore (1971-1974).
In 1971, a much more pronounced spreadbore design was released, dubbed the 4300D. They are incompatible with other spreadbore intake designs.
4300D 715 CFM specs:
Motorcraft 4350.
The 4300D was replaced by the Motorcraft 4350 carburetor in 1975.
Criticism and improvements.
Both variants of the 4300 have been criticized for poor acceleration, rough operation, and a potential for fire due to a poor fuel inlet design. This negative reputation is not universally accepted amongst users of these carburetors.
Rebuilding company Pony Carburetors (now defunct) claimed that they were successful in redesigning the 4300's internal design to offset most of these issues.

Bromfield (Cumbria) railway station

Bromfield was a railway station which served Bromfield, a small settlement in Cumbria on the English side of the Solway Firth. The station opened on 8 August 1870 by the Caledonian Railway on a line constructed from the Caledonian Railway Main Line at Kirtlebridge across the Glasgow South Western Line, then forming the Solway Junction Railway over the Solway Viaduct to Brayton. The line opened in 1869 and freight had run from since 13 September 1869.
History.
Bromfield station was opened by the Solway Junction Railway, then part of the Caledonian Railway. At first the station was a request stop, however on 1 January 1873 a crossing keeper was appointed and the level crossing signalled. At the south end of the station was a siding leading to the goods yard, worked by a frame which was controlled by the train tablet for the section Abbey Junction and Brayton. The station siding was provided for Fielding & Company and was 1¾ from Brayton Junction. The station today is a private house.
The passenger service was never well patronised. In 1910 only three trains in each direction served the station, with an Brayton to Abbey Junction working once a week. It was further reduced to being just one carriage at the front of an occasional goods train and in September 1917 this was suspended, but was reinstated in 1920. Passenger services were finally withdrawn in 1921 and the line south of Annan over the Solway Viaduct was closed completely.
The station had one platform with two simple station buildings, one stone and the other constructed of wood. The closure of the station was directly linked to the closure of the Solway viaduct.
The line remained open to through traffic until 14 February 1933; the track was lifted in 1937.
Micro-history.
Until October 1895 the station name was shown as Broomfield in timetables. The track was removed from Bromfield in 1937.

Herbert Ricke

Herbert Rüdiger Ricke (September 27, 1901 – Mars 22, 1976), was a German archaeologist, Egyptologist and architectural historian who is best known for his works on ancient Egyptian architecture.
Biography.
H. Ricke studied architecture from 1920 to 1925 at the University of Hanover where he was influenced by the Bauhaus. After obtaining his Diplom in 1925, he worked in Egypt from 1926 to 1928 under the direction of Ludwig Borchardt on the publication of excavations undertaken at Tel al-Amarna by the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft (German oriental society), which had been interrupted by the first world war. Thanks to his work "Der Grundriss des Amarna-Wohnhauses" (The plan of dwellings at Amarna), he received his doctorate under the supervision of Uvo Hölscher at the University of Hanover. He then returned as an employee of Borchardt in Egypt, in Borchardt's Institute, now known as the Swiss research institute on Egyptian architecture and archaeology in Cairo. He undertook excavations in western Thebes from 1934 to 1937 and in Karnak and Elephantine in 1938. 
The outbreak of the second world war surprised him while he was in Switzerland and prevented his return to Egypt. H. Ricke thus worked at the institute headquarters in Zurich during the war. He resumed work in Egypt after the war and from 1944 until 1950 published his most important work "Bemerkungen zur ägypt. Baukunst des Alten Reichs" (Remarks on the Egyptian architecture of the Old Kingdom). From 1950 onwards he led the institute as a research expert together with its executive director Dr. Étienne Combe. They placed the institute under the patronage of the Swiss Embassy in Cairo and consequently had it renamed Schweizerische Institut für Ägyptische Bauforschung und Altertumskunde in Kairo. At the time he worked on excavations and architectural history studies at Karnak (1952–54), Dahshur (1951–1955), Abusir (1954–57) and Elephantine (1954, 1958). 
In 1957 he became the scientific director of the institute and worked in Khor-Dehmit and Beit el-Wali (1960–61), Giza (1965–67) and again in Thebes (1964 and 1970). H. Ricke finally became the executive director of the institute in 1962, a position he held until his retirement in 1970. He retired in Dießen am Ammersee (Upper Bavaria) where he died 6 years later.
Honors.
In 1953 H. Ricke was elected corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute. He became an honorary member of the Egyptology Institute of Charles University, Prague (1963), Member of the Academy of Sciences in Göttingen (since 1965) and the Institut d'Egypte (1968).

Lazzaretto of Ancona

The Lazzaretto of Ancona, also called the Mole Vanvitelliana, is an 18th-century building constructed on an artificial island for the purpose of serving as quarantine station and Leprosarium for the port town of Ancona, Italy.
The pentagonal building rises on an artificial island in the port which is now connected to the mainland by three bridges. It was a project commissioned by Pope Clement XII, designed by the architect Luigi Vanvitelli, and built (1733−1743) with originally no land link to the mainland. A well was located in the central Neoclassical tempietto dedicated to Saint Roch, patron of lepers, in the center of the courtyard. It was built to house possibly infected travellers and goods arriving in the port, as well as lepers.
While the term lazaretto has been interpreted by some as merely a "quarantine station for maritime travellers", for centuries it was the term used to refer to lazar house (Leprosarium or Leper colony), referring to the one of the two New Testament persons named "Lazarus" ().
Over the years, the site has taken different functions, mainly as a military citadel since the 19th century. During World War I, there was a failed attempt to sabotage the Italian naval resources by 60 infiltrating Habsburg sailors. Now it is used as a site of the museum "Tattile Omero", as well as home for various exhibitions. 
It is not clear why a pentagonal shape was chosen for the building. However, the rationalistic and functional ensemble is common to many works of late Enlightenment architecture. The simple but elegant style somehow seeks to redeem the intended, but somewhat sordid purpose; and in this case, enlightened architecture for a less enlightened aim of segregating the elements of the populace that could be viewed as pestilent. The efforts of this work can be compared to the contemporary architecture of institutions meant to provide geometrically compelling structures to house services for the poor in Naples by Fernando Fuga, such as the massive Royal Hospice and Hospital for the Poor and the mathematical Cemetery of the 366 Fossae.

Peredo was born and grew up in Beni Department in northern Bolivia, and was strongly influenced by his older brothers who helped found the Bolivian Communist Party and were leaders in guerrilla movements. After receiving his initial medical training Peredo left the profession and joined the Ñancahuazú Guerrilla movement of Che Guevara, known as the National Liberation Army (ELN). However, because of the need for medical services, Peredo left to attend Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow where he received advanced medical training as well as idelological training. Upon his return to Bolivia he began one of the leaders of the movement. After Che Guevara was killed, Peredo was among those few who managed to escape to Chile. In November 1970, Salvador Allende, after he assumed the presidency of Chile, pardoned Peredo and the other survivors.
While practicing medicine as a guerrilla, Peredo developed his use of hypnotism as a therapy, both for the control of pain and for psychological trauma. He developed a hypothesis somewhat similar to L. Ron Hubbard's engram theory in Dianetics, namely that past painful memories were the source of some current illness.
In 1997 Peredo joined Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples and actively worked for the election of Evo Morales. In 2006, Peredo was elected as an alderman on the Municipal Council of Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

Joseph Bromfield

Joseph Bromfield (1744-1824) was a notable plasterer and architect working in the West Midlands and in Central and Northern Wales in the late Georgian period. He was mayor of Shrewsbury in 1809.
Early career.
He was born, probably in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in 1744. His father, Robert Bromfield, was a builder. By 1752 the family had moved to Old Swinford in Worcestershire, where his father had become the clerk to the works at Hagley Hall. Joseph Bromfield was one of four brothers - the other three were also involved in the building trades, the youngest being Benjamin Bromfield, who became a sculptor, designer and manufacturer of marble fireplaces which he supplied to stately homes including Chirk Castle in Denbighshire. The father, Robert Bromfield, appears to have been associated with the Shrewsbury architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard whose most important work was the designs for the Iron Bridge at Ironbridge. Through this connection his son Joseph started to undertake plasterwork commissions for Farnolls Pritchard.
Architect.
In 1777 when Farnolls Pritchard died, Bromfield, a talented draughtsman, appears to have decided to work as an architect and to take over Farnolls Pritchard’s architectural practice. Initially he worked in Shropshire, but his architectural practice gradually spread to cover most of North and Central Wales. He owned a property, Brannas Lodge on the river Dee, near Bala in Merionethshire, from where he seems to have practised. He now undertook some commissions for fairly major country houses, such as Rhug, Caerynwch and Nanhoron; rectories, including Newtown and Llandyssil in Montgomeryshire, and the workhouses at Morda outside Oswestry and Forden near Montgomery. His work is typified by the use of large bay windows and the use of “wrap-round” or half “wrap-round” verandas. He was influenced by the villa designs in Italianate style that was developed by John Nash, who had designed Cronkhill close to Attingham Park in 1805. Bromfield was also responsible for Berrington Rectory (later Berrington Hall) in the next parish to Cronkhill, as well as working at Attingham. Many Bromfield houses have typical low sloping Regency roofs with wide eaves. Broomfield was a pioneer of the early use of cast ironwork in domestic buildings, probably sourced from William Hazeldine’s foundries in Coleham Shrewsbury and Plas Kynaston near the Pontcysyllte aqueduct at Chirk. Examples of this ironwork can be seen at Plas Bodegroes on the Llyn Peninsula where the cast iron downspouts and hopper heads are dated 1779, and the Rectory at Llandyssil which has similar downspouts but also cast iron stantions used to support the veranda, which are similar to those used in early factory construction .
The most interesting house by Bromfield is Glansevern Hall, between Welshpool and Newtown, which was completed for Sir Arthur Davies Owen in 1807. This house in the Greek Revival style and the stone from which it was built came from the Cefn quarries in Minera near Wrexham. The use of the Greek revival style is comparatively rare and Pevsner and Lang point out that the earliest example of it is James "Athenian" Stuart’s Doric temple at Hagley Park. As Joseph Bromfield’s father was the clerk of the works at Hagley, he may have got the idea from this, or alternatively he may have been aware of the work of Thomas Harrison of Chester, who was a major exponent of this style. For the lodge at Brannas Bromfield uses ‘Gothic’ rounded arch windows, apparently copying Farnolls Pritchard, who was very fond of using Gothic and Chinoiserie styles in his architecture. The alterations to Brynkinallt, Denbighshire in 1806 show that Bromfield could also work in the castellated Gothic style.
Until recently Joseph Bromfield was largely unrecognised as an architect. Howard Colvin’s first edition of the “Bibliographical Dictionary of British Architects” failed to make any mention of his work, while the third edition published in 1995 observes that Bromfield “As an architect he appears to have been competent but unremarkable”. Noticeably the 4th edition (2008), which lists more examples of his work, omits this remark.

Papat Limpad

Papat Limpad (English: Fantastic Four) is a seven-month writing competition in the Javanese-language Wikipedia. The purpose of this competition is to revitalize the "barely alive" Javanese-language Wikipedia. Javanese Wikipedia started in January 2003, began to have a larger number of regular contributors in mid-2006, and began to see its golden era for seven years in 2008. However, the activity decreased and returned to 2006 status, with only 2 to 1 regular contributors for the last two years. The Javanese-language Wikipedia ranked 71 in the number of pages being viewed by 1.2 million viewers a month (before intervention). Wikimedia Indonesia believes that Javanese Wikipedia has an untapped potential growth and an untapped potential editor base that needs to be reached.
Proposed solution.
On December 2010, Javanese Language Wikipedia sysop and co-founder of Wikimedia Indonesia proposed to use one potential University in Semarang, Central Java Universitas Negeri Semarang (Public University Semarang) also known as UNNES, as location and resources of this pilot project. UNNES met the rationale that Semarang is a location where Javanese Language population reside, and the university also have a Javanese Language major specific. The success of competition in Indonesian language Wikipedia are hoped to be replicate in Javanese Language Wikipedia. However, lesson learn from the competition proves that after 72 days of competition, none of the participant return to edit further - this result is not acceptable in Javanese Language Wikipedia, considering the high cost where the trainee need to be flown regularly from Jakarta to Semarang. Therefore it is decided to have a seven months competition to compensate the cost.
Actual activities.
In January 2011 Wikimedia Indonesia's Papat Limpad team begin the trip from Jakarta to Semarang to introduce the initiative "Papat Limpad". Papat Limpad is an intervention project to Javanese Language Wikipedia natural declining stage by introducing a competition system in writing for Javanese Language Wikipedia to UNNES, using the same competing system in Indonesian Language Wikipedia known as . 
As incentive to 100 students that will compete writing in Javanese language Wikipedia for seven months, four laptops will be given to top writer contributors, while one laptop will be given to the head of Javanese Language Academy Major.
On February 2011, Wikimedia Indonesia began an intensive training to Semarang committee, the training include project management, competition monitoring, documentation, and reporting. Five people are selected with task distribution of coordinator and member of the committee. 
After one month committee training, the competition began on March 21, 2011 and ended on October 13, 2011. Exactly during the celebration of "Language Month" (October).
Project Goal.
Impact.
The impact of the project on WMF mission goals of Increased Reach, Increased Quality, Increased Credibility, Increased and Diversified Participation is shown by the increasing very active Wikipedian as illustrated in the statistics.
Planned goal.
Javanese language revitalization project has a simple goal: a sustainable growth for six months in 2011 with minimum of six very active user and outreach in Javanese language population city.

Hell of a Life (song)

"Hell of a Life" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album, "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" (2010). The song was produced by West, Mike Caren, Ernest Wilson and Mike Dean. The song features a number of samples, most notably "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath, and contains backing vocals by Teyana Taylor, signed to West's G.O.O.D. Music label. The song features a production style with influence from rock and heavy metal music, and is notably bombastic and aggressive in nature. The song expressive a narrative about West marrying pornographic film actor and the traumatic events that follow. It implores highly sexual, nightmarish imagery, and was inspired by West's relationship with model Amber Rose amongst other real-life events. 
The song received mostly positive reviews from music critics who noted the song for its sexual subject matter, praising the performance provided by West and the aesthetically pleasing imagery created by the song. The song was featured during West's Coachella Music Festival setlist and briefly appeared in his short film "Runaway", during a dinner sequence. It charted on the South Korean Gaon Chart at position 57.
Background.
"Hell of a Life" was recorded in Oahu, Hawaii, a trait the song shares with the majority of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy". Kanye West had faced various media controversies and expressed a desire to record his next album in a reclusive manner, straying away from collaborating with artists he didn't consider himself personally familiar with. The track takes inspiration from "Iron Man", a song first recorded by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath from their second studio album "Paranoid", which is also sampled on the song. Another source of music influence that the track drew from was Kraftwerk, an influential electronic music project from the 1970s. G.O.O.D. Music artist Teyana Taylor contributes backing vocals to the song, primarily within the last minute of the track.
Lyrically the song draws from West's relationship with model Amber Rose. West had first gotten into contact with Rose in 2008 and developed a romantic relationship with her. The couple had a dramatic break-up in 2010, due to allegations of adultery. The song is unique among songs featured on "My Beaufitul Dark Twisted Fantasy" as it is the only song on the album featuring vocals solely provided by West, who chose to otherwise collaborate extensively on the project.
Composition.
"Hell of a Life" tells the narrative between a marriage between West and a porn star. The porn star in question has been interpreted as an allusion to Amber Rose, a former stripper. Along with "Iron Man", the song samples "She's My Baby," by Sylvester Stewart, and performed by The Mojo Men; and of "Stud-Spider" by Tony Joe White. It is inspired by psychedelic rock, and features baroque braggadocio inspired rapping delivered by West. Aesthetically the production of the song draws from both stoner rock and progressive rock. It has been described as "feverish", "nightmarish", "grimy" and "grotesque" in nature. The primarily bombastic production is littered with heavy synths and brooding, abrasive riffs. The song expresses West's thoughts on relations and features highly sexual themes and imagery, sneering at people who judge him negatively. During the song's climax, West muses "how could you say, 'They live their life wrong?" before launching into the repeated refrain of "when you never fuck with the lights on?" The melodic, riff-ridden chorus is sung by West, boasting about how "pussy and religion is all I need." Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal summarized the song, writing:
"'Hell of a Life' attempts to bend its central credo-- 'no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need'-- into a noble pursuit. As a woofer-mulching synth line lurks, Kanye justifies his dreams of not sleeping with but marrying a porn star, peaking with the combative taunt, 'How can you say they live they life wrong/ When you never fuck with the lights on.' Inspired by his two-year relationship with salacious model Amber Rose, the song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. It's a zonked nirvana with demons underneath; a fragile state that can't help but break apart on the very next song." 
Ann Powers of "Los Angeles Times" described the song as a "porno fantasy", and commented that the track reveals West's true feelings on women, writing that it resurrects familiar mythologies about women — that they're monsters, killers, fallen angels — in language vibrant enough to fully revive these old stereotypes." According to IGN's Chad Grischow, the track is fueled by "the fuzzed-out synth and melody borrowed from Black Sabbath's 'Iron Man'," stating that "Hell of a Life" plays like it was inspired by "the latest season of "Entourage", as Kanye falls hard for a porn star and spins rapidly out of control as he plans their future."
Reception.
David Amidon of PopMatters commented that much like every song on "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", the song "contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront", concluding that tracks "Hell of a Life" and "So Appalled" alone "carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool's errand." "Chicago Sun-Times" writer Thomas Conner cited the song as one of the album's "temporary highs" describing it as a "mixture of metal strut, Gothic keyboards and a bender gone off the rails." Andy Gill of "The Independent" cited the song as a highlight of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", describing the song as a "brutal rumination on West's sexual appetite" and stating that the track contained a "buzzy synth motif" and "racing minimalist keyboard flourishes". 
AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer stated that the track featured a "sleazy beat", noting that the song "takes us further into West's dark psyche." J. Tinsley of the Smoking Section described the track as an admirable effort by West, but commented that it was one of the less tracks on the album ultimately. Andrew Barber of "Complex" complimented the song for successfully providing an escapism fantasy, musing that "Kanye takes us on a spaced-out journey to a world where excess is the norm—a world most of us will never encounter." Sean Highkin of the website Beats Per Minute cited the sampling of "Iron Man" as one of the album's most ambitious moments, writing that "any time Kanye has to make a choice between under and overdoing something, he always opts for the latter". Baron Zach of "The Village Voice" praised the story and production of the song, stating that the song contained a "great" sample. The song charted on South Korean Gaon Chart at position 57.
Marketing.
The song was also featured as in "Runaway", a 35 minute music video directed by West set to music from "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy". The beginning of the song is featured at the end of the dinner sequence. The song was featured during West's setlist during his 2011 performance at Coachella. At a concert in New York, West performed the song with Justin Vernon of folk band Bon Iver, a musician who West had extensively collaborated with on the album. Vernon sang the chorus while West provided the rapping verses.

L. C. Dunn

L. C. (Leslie Clarence) Dunn (born November 2, 1893, Buffalo, New York - March 19, 1974) was a developmental geneticist at Columbia University. His early work with the mouse T-locus and established ideas of gene interaction, fertility factors, and allelic distribution. Later work with other model organisms continued to contribute to developmental genetics. Dunn was also an activist, helping fellow scientists seek asylum during World War II, and a critic of eugenics movements.
Biography.
Dunn was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1893, to Clarence Leslie Dunn and Mary Eliza Booth Dunn. He earned a Bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1915.
Dunn served in the Harvard Regiment in France during World War I, and after the war, returned to Harvard University to complete his degree in 1920. After the war, he identified as a pacifist. He worked from 1920 - 1928 as a poultry geneticist at an Agricultural Experiment Station in Storrs, Connecticut, publishing almost fifty papers during this time.
Dunn, along with colleague E. W. Sinnott, was the author of one of the foremost early genetics texts, "Principles of Genetics" (first published in 1925).
In 1928 Dunn was invited to join Columbia University as a full professor in the Zoology Department. While there, he was renowned for his teaching, and influenced numerous students, included "outstanding" developmental biologists Salome Gluecksohn-Waelsch and Dorothea Bennett.
Dunn was married to Louise Porter, a Smith College graduate, and the couple had two children, Robert Leslie Dunn (b. 1921) and Stephen Porter Dunn (b. 1928). Dunn and his family loved literature and poetry, as did Dunn's mother, and established a press (Coalbin Press) to publish occasional volumes of poetry. The younger son, Stephen, was a social anthropologist and writer, publishing books such as "The Peasants of Central Russia" (1967) and "Introduction to Soviet Ethnography" (1974) (with his wife Ethel Deikman Dunn), "Cultural Processes in the Baltic Area Under Soviet Rule" (1966), and edited, translated, and taught.

Tarsophlebiidae

The Tarsophlebiidae is an extinct family of medium-sized fossil odonates from the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous period of Eurasia. They are either the most basal member of the damsel-dragonfly grade ("anisozygopteres") within the stem group of Anisoptera, or the sister group of all Recent odonates. They are characterized by the basally open discoidal cell in both pairs of wings, very long legs, paddle-shaped male cerci, and a hypertrophied ovipositor in females.
Description.
Adult.
Body.
The head is similar to that of Recent Gomphidae with two large and globular compound eyes that are distinctly separated, but closer together than in damselflies (Zygoptera). There are also two cephalic sutures.
The wing venation is characterized by the following features:
Sexual dimorphism.
Males are distinguished by paddle-like cerci, while females are distinguished by very long and thin, hypertrophied ovipositor that projects far beyond the abdomen.
The male secondary genitalia were of a unique primitive type, with a small sperm vesicle on sternite 3, two pairs of small plate-like hamuli on sternite 2, and a very short median ligula on sternite 2. Obviously, none of these structures is hypertrophied as sperm intromittent organ (functional penis). In each of the three suborders of Recent odonates, a different part of this apparatus is enlarged and developed as intromittent organ and device for removal of foreign sperm (sperm competition): in Zygoptera it is the ligula, an median process of sternite 2; in Epiophlebiidae it is the lateral pair of posterior hamuli on segment 2; and in Anisoptera it is the unpaired sperm vesicle on the anterior part of sternite 3. The structure of the apparatus in Tarsophlebiidae is suggestive of an intermediate state between protodonates and modern odonates. An exceptionally well-preserved male specimen of "Namurotypus sippeli" showed that protodonate Meganisoptera completely lacked a secondary genital apparatus on abdominal segments 2 and 3 and still had primary genitalia on segment 9 that strongly resemble those of wingless silverfish, who do not copulate but deposit external spermatophores. Only on the basis of such a mating behaviour is the evolution of the odonate secondary copulation conceivable at all. A first step probably was the attachment of a spermatophore to the basal sternites of the male abdomen instead of a deposition on substrate. The female now had to fetch the spermatophore from the male venter. This created an adaptive pressure to create storage structures for the spermatophore and attachment structures for the female genitalia. Tarsophlebiidae probably represent this state of evolution. The development of liquid sperm and intromittent organs for copulation apparently evolved three times in parallel in the three extant suborders.
Lateral auricles on the sides of the basal abdomen in male "Tarsophlebia eximia" had been described by Nel et al. (1993). However, Bechly (1996) showed that these alleged male auricles were based on a misinterpretation of the hamuli posteriors, which was confirmed by Fleck et al. (2004).
Fleck et al. (2004) demonstrated that male Tarsophlebiidae did possess a unique type of anal appendages. The description of calopterygoid-like appendages of "Tarsophlebia eximia", with apparently two pairs of claspers, was based on misinterpretations due to artifacts of preservation. The cerci are very long, with a double-barreled basal petiole and a distal plate-like expansion. The broken double-barrelled petioles of the two cerci have been commonly misinterpreted as two pairs of claspers, while the distal plates have been overlooked or regarded as artifacts. Indeed "Tarsophlebia" does neither possess zygopteroid- nor anisopteroid-like appendages. There are no visible paraprocts (as in Zygoptera) and no epiproct (as in Epiophlebiidae and Anisoptera). If these structures are secondarily reduced or primarily missing is not clear.
Larva.
No fossil larvae of this extinct family have yet been discovered.
Classification.
The family taxon was established by Handlirsch (1906) on the basis of the type genus "Tarsophlebia" Hagen, 1866.
"Tarsophlebiopsis mayi" was recognized as valid by most authors until the most recent revision of the family by Fleck et al. (2004), who demonstrated that the holotype of this taxon most probably is only an aberrant specimen of "Tarsophlebia eximia".
The family contains 2 described genera with totally 9 valid species:
All other described taxa are synonyms of the type species "Tarsophlebia eximia".
Phylogeny.
The monophyly of Tarsophlebiidae is strongly supported by the following set of derived characters (autapomorphies):
Bechly (1996) and Nel et al. (2004: Appendix 2) proposed a long list of putative synapomorphies that demonstrate a closer relationship of Tarsophlebiidae with crown group Odonata:<br>
presence of a costal triangle as broad and strong sclerotisation of the basal costal margin; the distal discoidal vein MAb (= distal side of discoidal cell) and the subdiscoidal vein (origin of the CuA on MP) are aligned and dorsally enforced by a strong sclerotisation, so that this structure appears to cross the vein MP and the concave fold along this vein (formation of a “discal brace” sensu Carle 1982); this discal brace is aligned with the arculus in the ground plan (only retained in some taxa with an open discoidal cell and in the forewings of Epiophlebia); the midfork (first fork of RP and base of IR2) is shifted basally, with the RP3/4 generally arising basal of the subnodus (reversed in some Coenagrionoidea) and RP2 arising close to the subnodus (in the ground plan); more derived type of nodus, with a kink in ScP; the oblique basal brace (still present in Protanisoptera and Protozygoptera) is transformed into a transverse “basal bracket” Ax0 which looks like a primary antenodal crossvein; presence of two strong primary antenodal crossveins Ax1 and Ax2 (also present in some Protozygoptera, e.g. specimen PIN 1/276 from the Upper Permian of Russia); pterostigma distinctly braced by an oblique postsubnodal crossvein beneath the basal margin of the pterostigma; presence of a tracheated lestine oblique vein 'O' between RP2 and IR2 (secondarily absent in some taxa); in the median space (= basal space) the convex vestige of the Media-stem (“vestigial CuA” sensu Fraser 1957) is suppressed since it is fused with the cubital stem to a common medio-cubital-stem (the alleged presence of this vestige in the holotype of "Tarsophlebiopsis" is a teratology or an artefact of preservation), convergent to some Protanisoptera, Triadophlebiomorpha, and Protozygoptera.
Bechly (1996) proposed that several unique symplesiomorphic features of all Tarsophlebiidae indicate that this family represents the sister group of all Recent Odonata. These features are the basally open discoidal cell in the hind wing (instead of closed) which implies an incomplete arculus, the (meanwhile disputed) presence of four tarsomeres of equal length (instead of only three), and the very primitive condition of the male secondary genital apparatus (viz ligula orimentary; vesicula spermalis still very short and flat with a very wide porus) without any intromittent organ. Bechly therefore considered the similarities of Tarsophlebiidae and Epiprocta mentioned by Nel et al. (1993), viz the less separated and relatively large eyes, the presence of two cephalic sutures, and the small leg spines (also present in Meganisoptera), as symplesiomorphies.
However, based on a cladistic study of 14 characters Fleck et al. (2004) again suggested that Tarsophlebiidae might rather be the sister group of the clade Epiprocta that includes Epiophlebiidae and Anisoptera. Nevertheless, this result has a very low statistical support and might as well be an artefact of the parsimony computer algorithm, because none of the 14 characters represents an unambiguous synapomorphy for Tarsophlebiidae and Epiprocta.
Huang & Nel (2009) presented convincing evidence from a new fossil Tarsophlebiidae from China that the number of tarsomeres is only three as in modern odonates, but that the first tarsomere is about twice as long as the others. Bechly (1996) already discussed this possibility and suggested that such a long basal tarsomere, compared to the short basal tarsomere in protodonates and all Recent odonates, could still be a plesiomorphic state that could have resulted by the fusion of two basal tarsomeres. Huang & Nel (2004) state that there is no evidence for such a fusion in the fossils and that the elongation of the first segment could as well be a derived feature (autapomorphy) of Tarsophlebiidae.
The two alternative phylogenetic positions of Tarsophlebiidae
Hypothesis of Fleck et al. (2004):
Hypothesis of Bechly (1996, 2007):
Biology.
Next to nothing is known about the ecology and behavior of Tarsophlebiidae, but it probably was quite similar to Recent odonates. With their very long ovipositor the females probably inserted their eggs into mud in or close to water, similar to modern Cordulegastridae. It is remarkable that two other groups of Mesozoic odonates (viz Steleopteridae and Aeschnidiidae) had a similarly elongated ovipositor.
Geographical and geological distribution.
The fossil record of this family ranges from Upper Jurassic of Kazakhstan and Germany to the Lower Cretaceous of England, Transbaikalia, Mongolia and China. The are no records of Tarsophlebiidae from any fossil locality outside the Eurasiatic region.
History.
The first tarsophlebiid fossils were specimens of "Tarsophlebia eximia" from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Plattenkalk of Germany described as ""Heterophlebia eximia"" and "Euphaea longiventris" by Hagen (1862). Larger revisions of this family have been provided by Nel et al. (1993) and Fleck et al. (2004).
Notable specimens.
Beside the important type specimens there are also several exceptionally well preserved fossils that contribute to our knowledge of the morphology of Tarsophlebiidae. These include the following specimens:

Chris Bailey (Australian musician)

Christopher Mark Bailey (31 May 19504 April 2013) was an Australian bass guitarist and vocalist. He was a member of various rock groups including Headband (1971–1974), The Angels (1977–1982, 2001, 2001–2006, 2008–2012), GANGgajang (1984–2013), and The Stetsons (1987, 1997). Bailey died of throat cancer, aged 62.
Biography.
Christopher Mark Bailey was born on 31 May 1950 in Keith, a rural town some 225 km south-east of Adelaide. His parents Alfred "Bill" Bailey and Gladys (née Spencer) were publicans. Bailey was sent to Prince Alfred College in Adelaide as a school boarder from the age of five.
From the age of 15, Bailey was playing bass guitar with various Adelaide bands. One of his earliest groups was Tattered Sole, which he formed while still at school with James Ashby on guitar, Freddy Frolich on lead vocals, Rob Tillett on lead guitar, and Bob on drums.
By 1969 Bailey had rejoined Tillett in his group Red Angel Panic, which included Ron Anderson on lead vocals, Peter McCormack on drums, Ken Skinner on organ, and Chris Timms on violin. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the group's style as "psychedelic/cosmic blues rock" and they were "one of the first outfits of the day to espouse a social and political agenda. The band played the college circuit, as well as the usual round of moratoriums and protest marches". Bailey was recorded on Red Angel Panic's two singles, "Viet Rock" (late 1970) and "Good Old Rock 'n' Roll" (1971), after which the group disbanded.
In February 1971 Bailey formed Headband with Joff Bateman on drums, Peter Beagley (later known as Peter Head) on keyboards and lead vocals, and Mauri Berg on guitar and lead vocals. McFarlane described this group's style as "progressive/blues rock ... played everything from blues and jazz to folk and country". They disbanded in 1974 and, in March the next year, Bailey issued a solo single, "Sunday Too Far Away", on RCA. Bailey rejoined Head in Mount Lofty Rangers, an ""ad hoc" country rock outfit", which had a variable line up including Bon Scott. During 1975 Bailey hosted a music TV series on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), "Solid Air". He had a short stint with another band, Salvation Air Force.
In January 1977 he joined pub rockers, The Angels, with Graham Bidstrup (aka "Buzz Throckman") on drums, John Brewster on rhythm guitar and vocals, his brother Rick Brewster on lead guitar, and Bernard "Doc" Neeson on lead vocals. Upon joining Bailey "allowed Neeson to concentrate on his duties as frontman", Neeson had previously played bass guitar for the group. During New Year's Eve 1979, The Angels performed on the Sydney Opera House steps, where Bailey and Neeson both received head cuts requiring stitches from bottles thrown by the audience. Bailey left the band early in 1982 after working on five of their studio albums.
Bailey worked with a range of artists including Gotham City (with former band mate, Tillett, in 1982), PM, Invisible Men, Wendy Saddington Band, The Famous Nobodies, and Rat Tat Tat. During late 1983 Bailey was living in Sydney and was approached by ABC to join a songwriting team working on a TV pop music drama, "Sweet and Sour" (July–August 1984). Bailey co-wrote tracks with Bidstrup and Mark Callaghan (ex-Riptides on guitar and vocals), together they formed a pop rock group, GANGgajang, with Geoffrey Stapleton (ex-The Aliens) on keyboards, guitar and vocals. Bailey remained with the group until 2012, periodically from 2000 he also performed in various line-ups of The Angels.
Personal life.
Just prior to his death, Chris Bailey married his partner, Josie O'Reilly, an actor-comedian, with whom he had a son. In January 2013 Bailey was diagnosed with mouth/throat cancer. The Angels confirmed his condition with a media release in January 2013, "are deeply saddened to learn that our bass player, Chris Bailey, has an aggressive, life-threatening cancer and is now undergoing palliative chemotherapy". On 4 April 2013 Christopher Mark Bailey died, aged 62. A tribute concert, Adelaide Salutes Chris Bailey, was held in his honour on 17 April with proceeds donated to his wife and son. The performers included Jimmy Barnes, Ian Moss, Phil Small, and Don Walker (all of Cold Chisel); James Reyne, his own band [Ganggajang, Swanee with The Brewster Brothers, and The Angels with Dave Gleeson (of The Screaming Jets).

Joshua Davis House (Orem, Utah)

The Joshua Davis House at 1888 S. Main St. in Orem, Utah, United States, was built in 1892. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1998.
J. Cory Jensen, in its NRHP nomination, wrote:
The Davis house is a good example of the transitional character of the architecture on the Provo Bench
at the latter-part of the 19th century. The salmon-colored, soft-fired brick, found on many of the homes
in the region, became available on the Provo Bench in the early 1880s which allowed for greater
variation in used in Victorian-style architecture. Although Classical in form, the Victorian influence in
the architectural details is readily apparent. Because many of the farmers on the bench struggled to
make an income for many years, the architecture of their homes remained in the simple,
unembellished Classical-style architecture of their predecessors. Those who saw success in their
farms began to build or alter their present homes in the Victorian styles, mainly the Victorian Eclectic
which enlisted such details as asymmetrical facades, bay windows, arched window and door openings,
wooden shingles on the vertical surfaces, decorative brickwork, and leaded-glass windows. The Davis
house combines a Classical house type with many of the Victorian Eclectic features common from
1885-1910.

<doc id="36826967" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36826967" title="Darayya massacre">
Darayya massacre

The Darayya massacre () was a reported massacre that happenened between 20 and 25 August 2012 in the town of Darayya in the Rif Dimashq province of Syria, during the Syrian civil war.
Background.
From the start of the conflict, the city of Darayya outside Damascus had been a hotspot for protesters against the government. When hundreds were arrested, locals took up arms. Two months before the massacre, the police and state intelligence had withdrew from the town.
Soon after, 3,000 FSA fighters made Darayya their stronghold. They held a strategic position, situated on the edge of the military airport at Mezze, which was being used for air-strikes against rebel-held areas. Rebels and local residents reported opposition forces conducted mortar and rocket strikes against the base from Darayya. Also, a few days before the government attack, the rebels claimed to have killed 30 soldiers when they attacked a military checkpoint outside the town.
According to local residents' account, the attack on the town started after talks for a prisoner swap between the rebels and the military had failed. On 20 August 2012, Darayya was shelled. After that, hundreds of soldiers, backed by helicopters and armored vehicles entered Darayya, facing little resistance. The last rebel group withdrew in the face of the military advance and opposition activists were fearing that young men suspected of being rebels could be executed.
Events.
On 25 August, the bodies of 200 people were reportedly discovered in the town. Most of the dead appeared to be the result of executions. SOHR reported that the death toll had thus reached 270 killed during the four-day attack on Daraya, including women, children and rebels. 40–50 of the day's corpses had been discovered near a mosque. 80 of the dead had been identified as civilians, while 120 remained unidentified. An activist inside the town said he had seen a young 8-year old girl shot dead by army sniper fire. Residents said that government troops and Shabiha militiamen raided some streets "two or three times". In several instances, they demanded hospitality when entering people's homes and then killing their hosts after leaving.
Opposition groups said that after the FSA fighters left the city, soldiers accompanied by shabiha militia members stormed in, raiding homes and arresting many, taking prisoners to the basements of empty buildings where they were shot execution-style, according to opposition accounts. Dozens were killed in Moadamyeh al-Sham, another Damascus suburb, the opposition said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights group said that 320 people were killed. The offensive against the town reportedly started with the military first surrounding Daraya, thus preventing civilians from escaping, then followed by several days of shelling and ending with house-to-house searches which resulted in executions. A video of what activists described as the fifth and latest mass grave to be filled showed two small children near the edge. One resident said, “The Assad forces killed them in cold blood...I saw dozens of dead people, killed by the knives at the end of Kalashnikovs, or by gunfire. The regime finished off whole families, a father, mother and their children. They just killed them without any pretext.”
On 29 August, journalist Robert Fisk, of "The Independent", entered the town and spoke with local residents, some out of earshot of Syrian officials. The residents gave accounts that differed from what was being reported in the media. Some stated that it was the FSA fighters that committed at least some of the killings, the dead being off-duty soldiers or pro-government civilians. They also stated that their homes had been overtaken by rebels and in some cases demolished. Others said they were not sure who was responsible for the killings.
Aftermath.
After the killings, government forces withdrew to the towns outskirts and remaining residents were able to search the town thoroughly, finding 120 bodies in one basement. Even pro-government TV aired footage of dead people, including women and children claiming "terrorists" as behind the killings. An opposition activist said that the army returned to some Dariya neighborhoods on 27 August and raided them, leading to the deaths of additional residents. A shopkeeper in the city said that "We found more than 100 dead bodies in the Abu Suleiman Derane mosque and gathered around 200 from homes and the streets to bury them in a mass grave today because the town’s graveyard is already full, the regime killed whole families from Daraya to punish us," he added. A GlobalPost reporter described Daraya as a city of “ghosts and dead bodies.”

In November 2012, London hosted the Caspian Corridor Conference, which Chairman Hajiyev helped lead. The conference brought together global leaders of government, business, academia and media to examine challenges and opportunities facing the Caspian states and develop business solutions.
TheCityUK.
Chairman Hajiyev has led the IBA to join TheCityUK as the first member from the Caspian region. TheCityUK is the new, independent membership body for promoting the UK-based financial and professional services industry. 
"We are grateful for the opportunity to expand corporate relationships between Azerbaijan and Great Britain. The high 
professionalism of TheCityUK team contributes to promotion of high standards of business running in tandem with the growth of a new market," Chairman Hajiyev said.
Business accomplishments.
American Express.
On November 3, 2012, it was reported that under Chairman Hajiyev’s leadership, the IBA and American Express have signed an exclusive cooperation deal. "According to the International Bank of Azerbaijan, this agreement will become a new step in the development of relations between International Bank of Azerbaijan and American Express." 
AzMeCo.
IBA has provided capital financing to AzMeCo, an Azerbaijani methanol production company. In November 2012, AzMeCo signed a contract with BP for the sale, purchase and marketing of methanol produced at the AzMeCo plant in Azerbaijan. The process will begin in 2013. The cost of the plant construction will be $360 million U.S. dollars.
Diners Club.
In October 2012, Chairman Hajiyev expanded the international banking payment system into Azerbaijan, which is expected to increase economic development, by signing a deal with Diners Club. The deal will bring Diners Club into the IBA payment system. An IBA spokesman was reported to say, "We are pleased to work with Diners Club. As a result, the cards of the first international payment system will be represented in Azerbaijan." 
Dividends.
In November 2012, shareholders voted to pay over 63 percent of undistributed profits as dividends. Approximately 8.6 million manat will be paid out as dividends. For 2009, 2010, and 2010, the bank's net profit amounted to 200.958 million manat. Revenues equaled 1.2 billion manat.
Islamic Banking.
In early 2012, Hajiyev announced that the International Bank of Azerbaijan would be expanding to bring Islamic banking services (banking activity that is consistent with the principles of sharia law) to countries near Azerbaijan. DHajiyev told Trend News Agency, "For the first time in Azerbaijan's history, we are planning to establish a new office in the field (Islamic banking), enabling the country to become a regional center for Islamic financing".
Making Azerbaijan a major center.
In October 2012, "Azer News" reported that Azerbaijan is becoming a regional center for Islamic financing. According to the article, "Islamic financing is one of the fastest-growing segments of the global financial services industry worldwide. The International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA), the country’s leading bank, has recently established an Islamic banking department . . ." 
The article reported that under Hajiyev's leadership, IBA will offer the following Islamic banking services:
World Economic Forum.
Hajiyev has led the International Bank of Azerbaijan to international prominence. In 2007, "Business Wire" reported that the bank had become a Founding Member of the World Economic Forum's Community of Global Growth Companies. 
According to the article: "The International Bank of Azerbaijan is the first Global Growth Company (GGC) from the Caucasus and Caspian region. IBA was chosen because the bank is the strongest financial group in the Southern Caucasus region and has proven itself a standard-bearer for international best practices in financial services and diversified growth. . . As the only National Development Bank, IBA plays a unique role in stewarding diversification of the economy. It has led numerous investments in non-oil sectors such as financial services, infrastructure, technology and consumer services that are stimulating economic growth at home and accelerating Azerbaijan's integration into the global economy."

Boris Braun

Boris Braun (August 20, 1920, Đurđevac) is a Croatian University professor, Holocaust survivor and member of the Jewish community in Zagreb.
Braun was born to Šandor and Elizabeta (née Mautner) Braun, members of a notable and wealthy Jewish family of Đurđevac. He had a sister called Štefica. The Braun family were reputable and respected in Đurđevac, where they owned the sawmill, vineyard, mill and ice factory. His father brought electricity to the Đurđevac region and maintained the local substation. Braun's father was a close friend of Ivan Šubašić and Mate Starčević, mayor of Zagreb, both of whom participated in the hunting events organized every year at the Braun estate.
Before the World War II he studied agriculture at the University of Zagreb. In 1941, with the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia, Braun was banned from the University of Zagreb for being Jewish. He returned to Đurđevac where he helped his father run the family business. Braun also helped maintain the substation and learned from his father's employees about electricity, knowledge that would later save his life. In the autumn of 1942, although his father was an acquaintance of the Independent State of Croatia military commander Slavko Kvaternik, Braun and his parents were arrested and transported to Zagreb, to the prison at Savska Cesta. Only Braun's sister managed to avoid the arrest because she was married to a Catholic from Zagreb. Eight months later in 1943, with a large group of Jews from Zagreb, Braun and his parents were deported in the cattle wagons to Auschwitz. His parents were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, but Braun saved himself when he lied that he was an electrician. In Auschwitz, with others, Braun repaired and maintained the gas chambers. Some time later Braun volunteered to be transferred to the Central Labour Camp Jaworzno, as the Nazis looked for volunteers to establish the new camp. At Jaworzno, Braun maintained the SS and prisoner barracks. On 17 January 1945 Braun was marched away westward with other prisoners. Hundreds died on the way to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Lower Silesia, including about 300 shot dead in a massacre which occurred on the second night of this death march. From Gross-Rosen concentration camp, Braun was transported to Buchenwald concentration camp. There he welcomed liberation and the end of World War II. In the summer of 1945, Braun returned to the University of Zagreb, where he finished his studies at the Faculty of Agriculture. He worked as a professor at the university until 1971, that year he rebelled against the decision of the other university professors to expel a colleague who had participated in the Croatian Spring. Later he has worked as an poultry inspector. Braun is very active in witnessing the horrors of Holocaust to elementary and primary school children across Zagreb.
In 2005, Braun was named an Honorary Citizen of Đurđevac.

Héctor Félix Miranda

Héctor Félix Miranda (born c. 1941 – died April 20, 1988) was a Mexican journalist and columnist of the Tijuana-based "Zeta" magazine, which extensibly reported on corruption and drug trafficking. In the late 1970s, he began to work for the daily newspaper "ABC" under Jesús Blancornelas and wrote under the name "Félix el Gato" ("Felix the Cat") to criticize local politicians. These columns eventually angered Baja California's state government and Mexico's former President José López Portillo to the point that the government ordered Blancornelas to fire Félix and banned its distribution. When Blancornelas refused, a SWAT team was sent to take over the paper's offices on the pretext of settling a labor dispute.
In 1980, Blancornelas and Félix co-founded the weekly magazine "Zeta". Through the magazine, the pair continued their investigation into organized crime and corruption. Félix contributed a column titled "A Little of Something", in which he satirized and criticized government officials, particularly those of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He particularly targeted Jorge Hank Rhon, son of a former Mexico City mayor and the owner of a Tijuana racetrack.
Félix was assassinated on April 20, 1988, when a car cut in front of him in traffic; another vehicle pulled alongside, and Félix was hit with multiple shotgun blasts. Two guards from Hank Rhon's racetrack were later convicted of the murder. In protest of the killing, as well as those of 28 other journalists since the election of President Miguel de la Madrid, a national journalism organization boycotted a Press Freedom Day ceremony at which la Madrid had been slated to speak. 
As of 2004, Blancornelas left Félix's name on the "Zeta" masthead, marked with a black cross. He also published a full-page ad in every issue under Félix's "byline", asking Hank Rhon why Félix had been murdered.
Assassination.
Félix Miranda's sassy, humorous, and provocative writing style on issues covering corruption and drug trafficking earned him a lot of popularity among many readers in Tijuana, but many of those involved in the drug trade disliked him. While he was traveling to work on April 20, 1988, Félix Miranda was shot and killed by a gunmen. After his death, Jesús Blancornelas published articles from his newspaper with Félix Miranda's name as the copublisher – as if he were alive. Blancornelas accused Jorge Hank Rhon, a prominent businessman in Tijuana, for ordering the assassination of his co-worker. By 1997, two of Rhon's body guards were arrested and serving prison time for the crime, but the Mexican authorities never confirmed who had ordered the execution. In court, the bodyguards professed their innocence and said that they were "tortured into confessing." After several years, the investigation was closed, but suspicions remain about whether the investigation of the case was all-inclusive and about the involvement of Hank Rhon and other politicians in Baja California.
Félix Miranda was known in Mexico for his humorous reporting tone that satirized the corrupt doings of local and state officials in his column. Among his favorite targets was Hank Rhon, the famous race track owner and son of the former Agriculture Secretary of the state, Carlos Hank González. The journalist once published in one of his columns that Rhon had laundered money at his Agua Caliente Racetrack.
Blancornelas, Félix Miranda's writing partner, continued his aggressive writing style and published more articles on the Tijuana Cartel and on the drug trade than many other Mexican newspapers. In response to the death of his colleague, Blancornelas issued an ad pressuring the Baja California that read the following, "Jorge Hank Rhon: Why did your bodyguards assassinate me?" in reference to the death of Félix Miranda.
Over the years, Blancornelas received numerous death threats, a murder attempt, and international press rewards for his work.

Muhammad Umran

Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Umran (; 1922–4 March 1972) was a founding member of the Military Committee of the unitary Ba'ath Party, and a leading personality in Syrian politics from the 8th of March Revolution until the 1966 Syrian coup d'état.
Life and career.
Umran was born in 1922 into an Alawi smallholder family which belonged to the Khayyatin tribe. He hailed from the village of al-Mukharram, a village situated in the mountains east of Homs. Umran served in the Syrian Army during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and became active in politics following the military's forceful intervention in Syrian politics during the 1940s and 1950s. He played a small role under the aegis of Akram al-Hawrani in the 1954 uprising against Adib Shishakli's rule.
He was one of the five founding members of the Military Committee, but acted as the committee's leading mind. Umran was the committee's chairman until the 8th of March Revolution in 1963, and was the oldest committee member. In the beginning, the Military Committee's goal was to rebuild the Ba'ath Party, which had been dissolved on the orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser when the United Arab Republic was founded, and establish a new party leadership. During the UAR years, Umran and Jadid travelled the country and established contact with former party comrades, but without mentioned the existence of the Military Committee. In the immediate aftermath of the UAR's dissolution, Umran contacted the other members of the Military Committee, and asked about the possibility of launching a coup to reestablish the union. He had outlined the political climate in Syria, and compared the strength of the Ba'ath Party against other political opponents – he reached the conclusion that a coup could be successful.
Umran was a delegate at the 5th National Congress of the Ba'ath Party, and told Michel Aflaq of the Military Committee's intentions – Aflaq consented to a military coup to take power, but no agreement was made between him and the Military Committee on how to share power after seizing power. Following the 8th of March Revolution in 1963 which brought the Syrian Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party to power in Syria, Umran was first given the command of the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was promoted in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. Umran was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in the Salah al-Din al-Bitar's cabinet, the first Ba'athist government in Syrian history.
After taking power, Umran became a member of the National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), the leading decision-making organ. The organ was controlled more-or-less by the Military Committee and the Ba'ath Party's military wing, and important decisions were made without the collaboration of their civilian colleagues. After complaints from the civilian wing, Umran gave the civilian wing (represented by Aflaq, al-Bitar and Mansur al-Atrash among others) a faint idea of what the military leadership was up to.
Umran was ousted from his position during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état by his former Military Committee comrades and was subsequently jailed in Mezzeh Prison. He was released following the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel, which ended in the latter's occupation of Syria's Golan Heights. Following his release, he fled to Lebanon. 
Death.
Umran was assassinated in Tripoli on 14 March 1972.

Hang Hubert Yin (born 5 July 1976) is a chemistry professor at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the BioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado Boulder, a recipient of several young scientist awards for his research in chemical biology and drug discovery.
Career.
Hang Hubert Yin was a pupil at the High School of Peking University. After studying for a bachelor’s degree at the Peking University, he received his PhD from Yale University, New Haven in 2004 (supervisor: Professor Andrew D. Hamilton FRS) and then spent a post-doctoral period at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine under the supervision of Professor William DeGrado. In 2007, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is a member of the University of Colorado Cancer Center, the BioFrontiers Institute, and the Center of Neuroscience at the University of Colorado. His research interests lie at the interface of chemistry, biology, and engineering with particular focuses on structure-based drug design, cell signaling biochemistry, biotechnology development, and membrane protein simulations.
Significant contributions.
Yin's team showed that morphine causes inflammation by binding to the protein lymphocyte antigen 96, which, in turn, causes the protein to bind to an immune system receptor called Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The morphine-induced TLR4 activation attenuates pain suppression by opioid and enhances the development of opioid tolerance and addiction, drug abuse, and other negative side effects such as respiratory depression. The Yin group has developed drug candidates that can improve opioid-based pain management therapies.

1979 Tumaco earthquake

The 1979 Tumaco earthquake occurred at 02:59 local time (07:59 UTC) on 12 December. It had a magnitude of 8.2 on the Moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX ("Violent") on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicenter was just offshore from the border between Ecuador and Colombia, near the port city of Tumaco. It triggered a major tsunami, which was responsible for most of the estimated 600 deaths. The hardest hit area was Colombia's Nariño Department.
Tectonic setting.
Coastal parts of Ecuador and southern Colombia lie above the convergent boundary where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate along the Colombia-Ecuador Trench. At his location the Nazca Plate is moving to the east relative to South America at a rate of 58 mm per year. North of the Carnegie Ridge, the subduction interface has four recognisable segments, from south to north, the Esmeraldas, Manglares, Tumaco and Patia segments. This plate boundary has been the location of several great historical earthquakes, most associated with damaging tsunamis. In 1906 a 5–600 km long segment of the plate interface ruptured, causing a M 8.8 earthquake (rupturing all four segments) and a trans-Pacific tsunami.
Earthquake.
This event was the last of three earthquakes that ruptured adjacent parts of the plate interface, forming a northeastward migrating sequence. The 1942 earthquake ruptured the Esmeraldas segment, the 1958 earthquake ruptured the Manglares segment and the 1979 event ruptured the Tumaco and Patia segments. Together they ruptured the same part of the megathrust as the 1906 earthquake. The rupture area of the 1979 earthquake measured 280 km long by 130 km wide.
The earthquake was widely felt in both Ecuador (including Guayaquil, Esmeraldas and Quito) and Colombia (including Bogota, Cali, Popayan and Buenaventura).
The coast in the epicentral region subsided by up to 1.6 m during the earthquake and the land movement locally disrupted river drainage.
Tsunami.
The coast nearest the epicenter was hit by the first wave of the tsunami about three minutes after the earthquake. Three to four waves were observed, with the third being the highest. The third wave coincided with low tide, greatly reducing the extent of the inundation and the likely death toll. The maximum observed water height was 6.0 m at San Juan de la Costa, northeast of Tumaco. The tsunami was observed on the east coast of Japan, in Hawaii, Tahiti and Mexico.
Damage.
The earthquake caused widespread damage, particularly in Tumaco, where about a tenth of all buildings were destroyed, including 1,280 houses, and 25 people were reported either dead or missing. The fishing village of Charco was almost completely destroyed by the tsunami, the waves washing the houses inland into a nearby lake. 93 of the original population of 4,000 were reported either dead or missing. The tsunami also destroyed all the houses in San Juan de la Costa, with 199 reported either dead or missing. The total death toll was estimated to be 500-600 with another 4,000 injured.
Aftermath.
The damage caused by this earthquake and another in central Colombia a few weeks earlier, led to the development of a national building code for earthquake resistant structures for Colombia, which came into law in 1984.

Heart pine

Heart Pine refers to the heartwood of the pine tree, which is the non-living center of the tree trunk, while the sapwood is the outer living layer which transports nutrients. The heartwood from the pine tree, heart pine, is preferred by woodworkers and builders over the sapwood, due to its strength, hardness and golden red coloration. The longleaf pine, the source of much of the available heart pine found on the market is considered a high quality timber tree, a well known source for poles, pilings, posts, sawlogs, flooring, plywood, pulpwood and naval stores (tapped for turpentine).
Before the 1700s, in the United States, longleaf pine forests, covered approximately 30-60 million acres along the coastal plain from Virginia's southern tip to eastern Texas.
These pine trees, 80 to 120 feet tall, require 100 to 150 years to become full size and can live up to 500 years. An inch of heart pine requires 30 years growth. Due to deforestation and over-harvesting since colonial days, only about 3% of the original Longleaf Pine forest remains.
Currently heart pine for building and woodworking is procured by reclaiming old lumber and recovering logs, felled pre-1900, from rivers.

Sylvester matroid

In matroid theory, a Sylvester matroid is a matroid in which every pair of elements belongs to a three-element circuit (a "triangle") of the matroid.
Example.
The formula_1-point line (i.e., the rank 2 uniform matroid on formula_1 elements, formula_3) is a Sylvester matroid because every pair of elements is a basis and every triple is a circuit.
A Sylvester matroid of rank three may be formed from any Steiner triple system, by defining the lines of the matroid to be the triples of the system. Sylvester matroids of rank three may also be formed from Sylvester–Gallai configurations, configurations of points and lines (in non-Euclidean spaces) with no two-point line. For example, the Fano plane and the Hesse configuration give rise to Sylvester matroids with seven and nine elements respectively, and may be interpreted either as Steiner triple systems or as Sylvester–Gallai configuration.
Properties.
A Sylvester matroid with rank formula_4 must have at least formula_5 elements; this bound is tight only for the projective spaces over GF(2), of which the Fano plane is an example.
In a Sylvester matroid, every independent set can be augmented by one more element to form a circuit of the matroid.
Sylvester matroids cannot be represented over the real numbers (this is the Sylvester–Gallai theorem), nor can they be oriented.
History.
Sylvester matroids were studied and named by after James Joseph Sylvester, because they violate the Sylvester–Gallai theorem (for points and lines in the Euclidean plane, or in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces) that for every finite set of points there is a line containing only two of the points.

2012–13 Taça de Portugal

The 2012–13 Taça de Portugal was the 73rd season of the Taça de Portugal, the premier Portuguese football knockout cup competition organized by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF). It was contested by a total of 162 teams competing in the top four tiers of Portuguese football. The competition began with the first round matches in August 2012 and concluded with the final on 26 May 2013, at the Estádio Nacional in Oeiras.
Vitória de Guimarães were the winners, following their 2–1 defeat of Benfica. They secured their first title in the competition after five previous failed attempts and became the twelfth team to win the Taça de Portugal – the first first-time winners since Beira-Mar in 1999. With this victory, Vitória de Guimarães qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage.
Académica de Coimbra were the defending champions, after defeating Sporting CP 1–0 in the previous season's final, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Benfica.
Format.
As in the previous season, the competition format was organized in a knockout system consisting of seven rounds, which preceded the final match. Teams competing in the Second and Third Division, respectively the third and fourth tiers of Portuguese football, entered the competition in the first round. In the second round, Segunda Liga teams were joined by the first round winners and the remaining Second and/or Third Division teams that received a bye in the previous round. The second round winners advanced to the third round, where they met the top tier Primeira Liga teams for the first time. Unlike the previous rounds, which were contested in one-legged fixtures, the semi-finals were played over two legs in a home-and-away basis. The final was played at a neutral venue, the Estádio Nacional in Oeiras.
Teams.
A total of 162 teams from the top four tiers of the national football system from were considered eligible by FPF to participate in the competition:
Schedule.
All draws were held at the FPF headquarters in Lisbon.
First round.
Teams from the Second Division (II) and Third Division (III) entered in this initial round. The draw was made on 2 August 2012 and determined the 100 teams contesting this round and the remaining 30 teams with a bye into the second round. Matches were played mainly on 26 August, with a few taking place the day before and later on 9 September 2012.
The following 30 teams were given a bye into the second round:
Lourinhanense, Melgacense, Santa Maria and Limianos were the only Third Division teams to eliminate opponents from the upper Second Division tier.
Second round.
The 50 winners from the first round joined the 30 teams awarded with a second round bye and the 16 teams competing in the Segunda Liga (SL), the second tier league. The draw took place on 31 August 2012 and matches were played mainly on 16 September 2012, with a few games taking place the day before.
Third Division teams Aliados de Lordelo, Caldas, Lourinhanense, Oliveira do Hospital and Santa Eulália were the only teams to eliminate opponents from better ranked leagues. Lourinhanense defeated a Second Division team for the second consecutive time.
Third round.
The 16 teams competing in the top tier Primeira Liga enter the tournament at this stage, where they are joined by the 48 winners of the previous round. The draw for this round took place on 25 September 2012, and matches were played mostly during the weekend of 20–21 October 2012. The matches involving Benfica and Braga were played respectively on the 18 and 19 October, due to broadcasting purposes, whereas the match between Caldas and Coimbrões was postponed to 2 December 2012, due to logistical difficulties by the latter club.
Estoril-Praia and Sporting were the only Primeira Liga teams to fall in this round, both against teams from the same league. For the third and second consecutive round, respectively, Lourinhanense (III) and Oliveira do Hospital (III) reassured their maintenance in the competition at the expense of opponents from a higher league. Similar achievements were made by Pampilhosa (II), Pedras Rubras (III) and Penalva do Castelo (III).
Fourth round.
The draw for the fourth round took place on 29 October 2012, and matches were played mostly on 18 November 2012, with a few being held earlier on 16 and 17 November. The match between Desportivo das Aves and Coimbrões was played later, on 12 December, because of the delays resulting from the FPF evaluation of irregularities that occurred in the second round fixture between Operário (II) and Caldas (III).
In this round, three teams eliminated opponents from upper tier leagues: Arouca (SL), Tourizense (II), which advanced to fifth round as the last remaining Second Division team in competition; and giant-killers Lourinhanense (III), who have consecutively beaten teams from stronger leagues since the first round.
Fifth round.
The draw for the fifth round took place on the 20 November 2012, and matches were be played between 30 November and 2 December 2012. The match opposing Benfica (PL) and Desportivo das Aves (SL) was due to be played on 1 December but was rescheduled to 2 January 2013.
Primeira Liga champions Porto were beaten by league opponents Braga, becoming the second "Big Three" club to be knocked out, after Sporting in the third round. None of the last remaining teams from the Second and Third Division survived this round: Tourizense (II) was defeated by title-holders Académica, while Fabril Barreiro (III) lost to Belenenses (SL) and underdogs Lourinhanense (III) were finally halted at home by Paços de Ferreira (PL).
Quarterfinals.
The draw for the quarterfinals – which also determined the pairings for the semifinals – took place on 18 December 2012, and the matches were played on 16–17 January 2013.
Belenenses defeated Arouca in the match between the last surviving Segunda Liga teams, whereas Benfica ended the reign of defending champions Académica, with a crushing 4–0 away win.
Semifinals.
The semifinal pairings were previously determined during the draw for the quarterfinals, held on 18 December 2012. This round is contested over two legs, with the first leg taking place on 30 January 2013 and the second leg on 17 April 2013.

Lake Monroe Bridge

Lake Monroe Bridge was a two-lane steel bridge constructed over the St. Johns River at the west outlet of Lake Monroe between 1933 and 1994. It was a part of U.S. Route 17/92, and spanned the border between Seminole and Volusia Counties in Florida, United States. On the Seminole side is Sanford and on the Volusia side is DeBary. Historical markers claim it was the first electrically operated Swing Bridge in the State of Florida.
History.
Lake Monroe Bridge was originally built between 1932 and 1933 as a replacement for a wooden toll bridge that was manually operated. It was a Warren-Truss Swing bridge, fabricated by Ingall's Iron Works of Birmingham, Alabama, the swing gear was manufactured by Earle Gear and Machine Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was erected by W.W. White of St. Petersburg, Florida. The contracting company for the Florida State Road Department was Kreis Contracting Company of Knoxville, Tennessee.
Construction of the bridge provided economic relief to the region during the peak of the Great Depression, and the tourism it facilitated provided further relief after that period. When Interstate 4 was built in the late-1960s along with the original version of the nearby St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge, it provided temporary relief for the Lake Monroe Bridge, which proved to be crucial after the opening of Walt Disney World southwest of Orlando. Unfortunately in the latter portion of the 20th Century, the bridge proved to be inadequate to handle more modern traffic. In 1994, the bridge was replaced by the Bill Benedict Bridge a much higher concrete slab bridge that has four lanes, and was built between this and a CSX Railroad drawbridge that originally served the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The remnants of the bridge can now be found in Lake Monroe Wayside Park along US 17-92 in Sanford, and now survives as a fishing pier and overlook.

The press is both a student society and part of the Liverpool Students' Union media, which also provides funding. It is currently the only student newspaper in circulation in Liverpool.
Formation.
The press was formed in 2008 by Shamit Patel, originally starting as a website providing news on subjects such as entertainment and sport, as well as publishing student opinions on current affairs. Following continuing success, funding was provided by the students' union allowing the press to go into print in September 2010. Since then the newspaper is released quarterley throughout the year ("September", "November", "February" and "June") and made available on university campuses and throughout the city, as well as maintaining the press website.
The Looprevil Press works very closely with the student radio - Looprevil Radio.
Press identity.
The name "Looprevil" Press is "Liverpool" backwards, and the tagline of the paper is ""Bringing you the other side of Liverpool"". Both were done to express the duality of both, the fun student life and conducting professional journalism.
Awards.
The newspaper has become one of the most successful societies of the Liverpool Students' Union, and has since its formation been voted and awarded ""Best New Society 2009"" and ""Best Society 2010"" at the annual L-S-U Awards.

Benjamin Allen (cartoonist)

Benjamin David "Stookie" Allen (30 January 1903 - 6 January 1971) was a cartoonist who created the nationally syndicated comic strip "Mugsey". He worked on "Flapper Fanny" during the 1930s with his wife, Gladys Parker, while they lived in New York City. They moved to Los Angeles in 1937.
Allen grew up in Corsicana, Texas, and attended the University of Texas. A local sports legend, in 1924 he caught the winning touchdown pass against Texas A&M University when a bobbled ball was tipped into his hands, leading the Longhorns to 7-0 victory against the Aggies in the brand new Memorial Stadium. In college, Allen also played baseball and the St. Louis Cardinals offered him a pitching tryout. He left Texas to study at the Art Institute of Chicago.
Allen moved around the southern oil fields for a while and ended up working for Standard Oil looking for swamp gas. When that job ended he was set to work on a pipeline in Natchez, Mississippi, and was ready to take a job in Venezuela, when he was offered a position drawing sports cartoons for the Associated Press.
In 1940, Allen invested in a mica mine 90 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, with the 1920s New York band leader, Smith Ballew.
World War II.
When the war started, Allen was drawing the cartoon "Heroes of Democracy" and his patriotic cartoon motivated his decision to join the army. During World War II, Allen served as a major in the combat engineers in Europe. He was an art engineer drawing battle bridges such as one built by the 238th Engineers, 1106th combat group, crossing the Seine River south of Paris to replace the destroyed railway bridge shown in the background He also drew floating Bailey bridges like the one erected in August 1944 also spanning the Seine.
Comic strips.
In addition to Flapper Fanny, "Mugsey" and "Heroes of Democracy", Allen created and drew "Argosy" magazine's "Men of Daring" and "Women of Daring". When Allen moved to California, he drew a horse racing tip sheet comic called "It's a Bet" for the "Los Angeles Herald-Express". He also created "Keen Teens", another syndicated feature and "Detective Fiction Weekly'"s "Illustrated Crimes".
Heroes of Democracy.
A syndicated feature, "Heroes of Democracy", was devoted to the exploits of American heroes, such as "Wild Bill" Wellman of World War I.
"Men of Daring".
The action-story pulp magazine, "Argosy", contained a weekly feature called "Men of Daring", true stories in pictures. These one to two-page weekly picture stories contained the exploits of Americans, many relatively unknown, like Billy Bishop, air ace, infamous men like Edward Teach (aka Blackbeard), "as bold and cruel a rover as ever grasped hilt in hand". Allen often pictured celebrities such as Harry Houdini and the derring-do of international heroes like Alexander Sasha Siemel, Brazil's "Tiger Man". The art is strictly black-and-white, hand-lettered with depictions of landscapes, famous individuals, villains and mechanical inventions of the times. "Men of Daring" also appeared in the first two issues of the short lived pulp magazine "Red Star Adventures".
"Women of Daring".
"Argosy"'s weekly feature occasionally became "Women of Daring", starring such notables as Dame Rachel Crowdy "the first woman in history to win knighthood in her own right" and the female bullfighter Conchita Cintron. Girls could also look up to Mary Wiggins, the Hollywood stunt girl and high diver.
"Illustrated Crimes".
"Detective Fiction Weekly" contained "Illustrated Crimes" by Allen, a pictographic true crime feature. They had titles like "The Clue of the Folded Dollar", a detailed account of the murder of Louise Gerrish, a school teacher, or "The Case of Lawyer Gibson", about a wealthy widow murdered for her estate by her attorney.
"Keen Teens".
After World War II, Allen felt that too much attention was being paid to juvenile delinquents and decided to focus a pictorial column on teens doing positive things. He visited J. Edgar Hoover who thought it a good idea, so Allen created the syndicated feature "Keen Teens". These black-and-white cartoons often contained photographs as part of the feature, such as the camera featured in "Keen Teen" Lens Lad-Paul Nielsen.
Books.
To promote "Keen Teens", Allen wrote "101 Ways to Make Money: Keen Teens" which outlined how teens have "won fame, renown, and often small fortunes" by among other things, building collapsible boats, figurines and toys. "The perfect gift for the alert teen-ager" (Emerson Books, 1955). He also wrote "Bug Movies in the Funnies" a collection of his strips by the same name from 1930-34 (Dell Publishing, 1929), "Fighting Heroes: Battle for Freedom" (Whitman Publishing, 1942) and "Men of Daring" (Cupples and Leon Company, 1933).

Slaughterhouse (Hell on Wheels)

"Slaughterhouse" is the third episode of the second season of the American television drama series "Hell on Wheels", which aired on August 26, 2012 on AMC. The thirteenth episode of the series is co-written by Jami O'Brien & Bruce Marshall Romans, and directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. Bauer, the town butcher and friend of the deceased Schmidt, seeks to avenge his murder. His target: a bragging Mickey McGinnes (Phil Burke) and his brother Sean (Ben Esler). With no help from Elam (Common), Lily (Dominique McElligott) admits her involvement with Schmidt's murder to Durant (Colm Meaney), who asks Cullen (Anson Mount) to control the angry mob.
Plot.
The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) goads Bauer (Timothy V. Murphy), the town butcher, about Schmidt's murder. Bauer is upset that his friend was killed over a prostitute. At the saloon, Durant asks a hungover Elam to monitor Cullen. He agrees, but later mutters to himself that he could have done Cullen's job. At the brothel, Mickey promises prostitute Ginny (Sydney Bell) that anyone who threatens her will end up like Schmidt. When she asks if he killed Schmidt, Mickey does not deny it. In his tent, Eva (Robin McLeavy) thanks Elam for killing Schmidt. They kiss, but she scolds him for wanting money more than a good woman and leaves.
Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) complains to the Swede about daughter Ruth (Kasha Kropinski). He believes she has taken his place in the church and corrupted Joseph (Eddie Spears). The Swede encourages Cole with the biblical story of Jesus casting out the temple's moneychangers, adding, "We must cast them out." Ruth delivers Schmidt's eulogy at church but is interrupted when Cole accuses her of sleeping with Joseph, calling her a fornicator. Enraged by the interruption, Bauer lunges at Cole, but the Swede redirects his anger toward "the Irish brothers" who killed Schmidt. Bauer and his friends, along with The Swede, hunt down Sean and Mickey and direct them to the slaughterhouse.
Elam rushes in to alert Durant about the McGinnes brothers' abduction. Durant orders Elam to assist Cullen in controlling the situation. The mob hangs Sean and Mickey by their bound hands from slaughterhouse's meat hooks as the butcher sharpens his knife. Elam and Cullen storm in and free the brothers, but Cullen then leads them to the jail car. Mickey protests that he did not kill Schmidt, but acknowledges that he let everyone think so. Cullen still ushers them into the car. The butcher arrives to warn that either Cullen kills them or he will.
In the jail car, Mickey admits to Sean that he liked people thinking he was Schmidt's killer, and wanted Sean to think that he could do something on his own. Sean predicts that, even if they somehow "slip the noose", the "Kraut" will butcher them. Cullen tells Durant he believes the McGinnes brothers are innocent. Durant agrees to spare Sean but insists Mickey dies, since he confessed. Lily suggests they investigate further. She later asks Elam to confess, but he refuses, believing that if the McGinneses hang, he and Lily will be free. She decides to speak to Durant without mentioning Elam's involvement, confessing that she paid a man to kill Schmidt in the name of justice. Durant angrily asks if Lily would like to take Mickey's place on the gallows "in the interests of justice." 
Cullen interrupts the Swede's bath by pointing the Swede's own gun at his head. He suggests the Swede is taking revenge on the McGinneses for tarring-and-feathering him. He believes the Swede hates everybody, especially himself. The Swede retorts that he and Cullen are alike, but he hates Cullen more than Cullen hates himself. Lowering the gun, Cullen tells him that if he ever tries anything he will kill him. The Swede resigns himself and tells Cullen that he would miss him. 
Reverend Cole urges Joseph to leave town and return to his tribe, but Joseph says he no longer belongs there either. He tells Cole he loves Ruth and will not abandon her, unlike her own father.
Durant relents and gives into a silent Lily, who informs Cullen that Durant has authorized the brothers' release. Cullen says the butcher may inflict a worse fate on Sean and Mickey once they are free and he will not protect them. Cullen confronts Elam about killing Schmidt with a warning: "Next time a noose goes round your neck, might not slip off so easy." Cullen tells Bauer that Durant has pardoned the McGinnes brothers, then orders him to leave town immediately. When he resists, Cullen punches him. As Bauer packs his knives, the released brothers attack and kill him, feeding his body parts to the pigs.
Reception.
Ratings.
"Slaughterhouse" was watched by 2.50 million viewers and received a 0.6 rating among viewers aged 18-49, the season's highest ratings to date.
Critical reception.
The episode received positive reviews. "The A.V. Club"s Alasdair Wilkins gave "Slaughterhouse" a B- grade, calling it "weirdly admirable", but adding the episode "has a theme it wants to explore—people are bloodthirsty animals, per the Swede’s opening narration— the creative team still doesn't quite have the skill to bring it all together. This episode is full of stuff happening, and it's possible for the audience to see how each sequence links back to the episode's big idea, but that still means the underlying connective tissue is missing." Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.7 out of 5 stars, saying "Slaughterhouse" "proved that the season is getting better with each week." He added "the lawlessness of the land continues to prove intriguing, as the lines of friendship and alliances are as quickly crossed out as they are made."

Ajay Kapoor

Ajay Kapoor is a fictional character from the Australian television soap opera "Neighbours", played by Sachin Joab. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 13 July 2011. The actor was cast in the role following a successful audition. The part was initially going to last for about a month, but the producers liked him and the character. They then decided to create a family unit around Ajay and later introduced his wife Priya (Menik Gooneratne). Five months later it was announced that Joab and Gooneratne would be promoted to the regular cast in early 2012, while their on-screen daughter, Rani (Coco Cherian), would be introduced. The Kapoor's arrival marked the show's first family with Indian and Sri Lankan heritage and the first family to be introduced since 2010. Ajay departed on 12 July 2013.
Ajay was raised and educated in Erinsborough and became a lawyer. When he wanted to get involved in public service, he got a seat on the local council, which gave him an instant role with the community. Joab described Ajay as being "pretty positive" and stated that he does everything for his family. Ajay is married to Priya, the principal of the local high school. The couple had to get married when they were young because they were expecting their daughter. Both Priya and Ajay unintentionally put their careers before their marriage and Joab thought that they had forgotten about living in the moment. Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) began a rivalry with Ajay shortly after his arrival. When Ajay rejected his offer to help with his re-election campaign, Paul started to look for ways to destroy and discredit him.
Casting.
Joab told DJ Nihal from the BBC Asian Network that his agent got him the audition for "Neighbours". The actor had to ask his agent if he needed to put on an Indian or Arabic accent for the part, but was told to speak in his natural Australian accent. Joab stated that the audition for Ajay "just turned out to be like any other audition" and the part was initially going to last for about a month, but the producers really liked him. They later decided to introduce his wife, Priya (Menik Gooneratne), to create a family unit. Joab made his first screen appearance as Ajay during the episode broadcast on 13 July 2011.
On 7 December 2011, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that Joab and Gooneratne would be promoted to regular cast members in early 2012. He also revealed that Coco Cherian had joined the cast as Ajay and Priya's on-screen daughter Rani. The Kapoors became the first family to be introduced to "Neighbours" since the Williams' arrived in 2010. The show's then executive producer, Susan Bower, stated "I'm delighted by how the Kapoors have been introduced. Viewers already know them because of their role in the community and link with other characters, and their cultural background is secondary." Bower added that having a family of Indian and Sri Lankan heritage join the neighbourhood was very exciting.
Development.
Characterisation.
Ajay is a family man, who was raised and educated in Erinsborough. He became "an ambitious lawyer" and had a successful career in finance, but he felt a "calling" to public service. A writer for Joab's official website stated that Ajay decided "a seat on the Erinsborough council was the right place to begin a career in the community which he always felt connected to." Ajay's job as a local councillor gave him an instant role and connection to other character within the neighbourhood. Joab said Ajay was usually "a pretty positive guy" and admitted that he does everything for his family, but he forgets about being with them. Joab branded Ajay "very family-orientated" said he would not stand by for "anything which strayed from the truth." The actor thought that despite Ajay's eclectic interests, the character was quite similar to himself. When asked how he was like his character, Joab told a Channel 5 website writer that while Ajay was the better drummer, they both love their families and know how important they are. The actor wanted Ajay to be remembered for his passion and the fact that he "always lived by the truth."
Marriage to Priya Kapoor.
Ajay "had" to marry Priya when they were both young because she was expecting their daughter, Rani. Gooneratne revealed "They had to be a family at an age when their peers were out having fun, then they were establishing their careers, now it's buying a house. There hasn't been a lot of down time." During an interview for Channel 5's "Neighbours" website, both Gooneratne and Joab agreed that Priya was the boss in the relationship as she makes all the difficult decisions. The actors also stated that the couple had "unintentionally" put their careers before their marriage, leading to cracks appearing. Joab commented that because they are busy with life, Ajay and Priya had forgotten about living in the moment. Gooneratne also stated "Priya is the one that keeps it together, and when Ajay makes decisions without her involvement, she doesn't like it."
In July 2012, Ajay purchases Number 24 Ramsay Street without consulting Priya. Joab told an "Inside Soap" writer that Ajay and Priya had been talking about settling down in Erinsborough for a while, but buying Number 24 was "a pretty spontaneous decision" and it was not "a wise move" for Ajay to buy a house without discussing it with his wife first. Ajay also upsets new neighbour Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major), who planned to buy the house. Joab explained "It was never his intention to upset Lucas - that's not Ajay's style. He sees it as an opportunity for his family to be part of the neighbourhood in which they already work." Joab added that Ajay has "a knack" of turning things around with Priya. Gooneratne later commented that Ajay and Priya had lost their way due to their lack of communication.
Ajay later notices that Priya is becoming stressed and assumes it is because her friend, Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne), is demanding her support over various problems. Ajay asks Susan to give Priya some space, but Priya later opens up to him and reveals that she is unhappy in their marriage, causing him "immense hurt". Priya feels guilty about her revelation and attempts to make it up to Ajay, by throwing herself into the preparations for Diwali. Both Ajay and Rani are "thrilled" at Priya's participation and Ajay later decides to accept her apology.
Rivalry with Paul Robinson.
Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) tries to form "an alliance" with Ajay, but his offer is rejected as Ajay is not sure what he stands to gain. Paul becomes angry with the rejection and starts looking for ways to destroy Ajay. When Paul learns that Ajay is backing a decision to merge the local police station with one in a nearby suburb, he becomes critical of the plan, believing it to be a bad idea for the community. When he learns that there is a house party nearby, Paul decides to use the event as a way to discredit Ajay. Dennis explained that Paul encourages "a load of random people" to gatecrash the party, so that it gets out of hand. He then pretends to call the police, which delays their response time and allows him to blame the merger of the two stations for the street being trashed. Dennis told an "Inside Soap" columnist "Paul wrote a story for the newspaper, blaming Ajay for the party getting out of hand - before anything happened on Ramsay Street." Susan Kennedy and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) discover what Paul has done and they ask him to print a retraction, but he refuses. Summer sees the damage that the situation is doing to Ajay's career and encourages Susan to reveal the truth. Paul later publishes "a hatchet article" about Ajay shortly before the local council election and Ajay "suffers a setback" when he loses his seat. When asked if he was enjoying having Ajay as Paul's new rival, he stated "Definitely - I enjoy it when Paul is toying with someone, and at the moment it's Ajay. It also provides some light relief because not all situations are high drama - Paul's pettiness can add a lot of humour to the story."
On 19 September 2012, it was revealed that Joab and Dennis had been filming a fight between their characters. A Channel 5 website writer commented that Ajay and Paul had had "a rocky relationship" since the lawyer moved into the neighbourhood, but it was the first time the men had come to blows. The actors refused to reveal who threw the first punch and why. Dennis commented "Ahh, you'll have to watch and see. However, I can say that any after-effects were applied by the make-up department, which we were both very pleased about. I think if Sachin punched me for real, I'd be back in a coma; he is a pretty fit guy!" The fight scenes between Ajay and Paul were broadcast three months later. Ajay's "world falls apart" when he learns Priya has had an affair with Paul. Joab commented "Ajay's emotions range between utter shock, heartbreak and temporary insanity." Ajay becomes furious after spotting Paul on the street and when he goes over to him, he takes an "almighty swing", leaving Paul with a black eye.
Departure.
On 12 March 2013, Seanna Cronin from "The Toowoomba Chronicle" reported that Joab would be leaving "Neighbours". The actor departed the serial after his contract ended in May, so that he could pursue new projects. Joab filmed his final scenes as Ajay on 2 May. Executive producer Richard Jasek stated that the cast and crew would miss Joab and added "The Kapoors have been at the forefront of some memorable storylines, which is testament to Sachin's talent. Like all our characters, we hope there will be opportunities for Ajay to return to Ramsay Street." During an August interview with Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly, Joab revealed that the Kapoor family were written out and they were "dumbfounded by the decision", especially as they did not see it coming. Joab explained "It was more of a shock to us knowing that it wasn't just one multicultural actor who was being written out, it was every single multicultural full-time actor on the show – myself, Menik Gooneratne who played Priya, Coco-Jacinta Cherian who played Rani, and Alin Sumarwata who played Vanessa. All four of us were written out in the first year of our full-time contracts, which felt like a massive step backwards in terms of cultural diversity on the show."
Joab told Kilkelly that the producers told him the reason he was being written out was a lack of storyline ideas for his character and a small budget. The actor questioned how there could be a lack of storylines for a character who had lost his wife and was raising a teenage daughter and suggested some ideas to the producers. He commented "Once Priya left, we could have explored whether Ajay would find a new love interest and how Rani would react to that. It would have also been a great opportunity to perhaps explore an interracial relationship for Ajay, which is so relevant in Australia and elsewhere. I think there was lots of potential for new stories." Joab did not rule out a return to the show and said he would come back if he was asked by the current or future production team.
Ajay made his on-screen departure with his daughter, Rani, on 12 July 2013. They left Erinsborough to take care of a sick relative in India. Joab thought the exit was "so low-key" that when it was broadcast in Australia, some viewers believed that the characters would be coming back. The actor called Ajay and Rani's departures "disappointing", but thought Priya's exit was "a great way" to write out a character. Joab also had issues with his character returning to India, since it did not make sense when Ajay had been born and raised in Australia. He tried to get the writers to send Ajay to another part of Australia, but they rejected the idea. The actor added that the writers eventually accepted his idea of Ajay and Rani visit their grandother in India and then leaving for the UK.
Storylines.
Ajay assesses the local community gardens and informs Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) that the council have decided to sell them. A few weeks later, Toadie interrupts Ajay and Priya's anniversary dinner as he needs some legal papers signing. Ajay asks Toadie to wait, but when Toadie sends over a bottle of champagne, he agrees to sign them. Summer Hoyland confronts Ajay about whether the champagne was a bribe and Toadie insists that it was not. Susan Kennedy asks Ajay if he can reverse the council's decision to close PirateNet and he agrees to look into it. But when the local paper accuses the council of ending community radio's right to free speech, Ajay tells Susan that the station cannot be reinstated as it would look like the council are backing down due to media pressure. Paul Robinson becomes determined to stop a local shopping centre development and asks cleaner, Lorraine Dowski (Zoe Bertram), to go through Ajay's documents and photograph them. Lorraine tells Ajay about Paul's plan and Ajay warns him to stop playing games.
Ajay stands for re-election to the council and turns down Paul's offer of help with his campaign. Ajay and Paul begin a rivalry when Ajay supports the decision to turn the local police station into a community centre and have the police force merged with West Waratah. When Ajay learns that his teenage daughter, Rani, attended a house party that got out of control, he demands that there is a thorough investigation. Paul states that he had to call the police twice and blames the station merger for compromising their response time. Paul writes an article about the situation, which damages Ajay career. Shortly before he decides to announce his resignation from the council, Susan reveals to Ajay that Paul made sure the party got out of control to discredit him and the merger plans. Ajay forms a band with Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) called The Right Prescription. Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) hires Ajay to help him gain custody of Callum Jones (Morgan Baker), but Ajay quits the case after Troy hold's Sonya (Eve Morey) and Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita) hostage.
During the filming of a music video, Ajay is caught rejecting a phone call from the Mayor and insulting him. Paul releases the clip online and damages Ajay's chances of getting re-elected. That same day, Ajay purchases 24 Ramsay Street at an auction, upsetting Priya as he did not consult her. Ajay meets with Toadie's boss Charlotte McKemmie (Meredith Penman) about a job and she offers him Toadie's promotion position. Ajay takes the job, briefly upsetting Toadie. When Ajay learns that Rani is going to a party with Harley Canning (Justin Holborow), he goes to stop her and bring her home. During an argument, Rani informs Ajay that Priya has been having an affair with Paul. Ajay does not believe Rani at first, but Priya admits that it is true and Ajay throws her out. He later punches Paul. Ajay allows Priya to move back in for Rani's sake and decides to quits his job. Rani vandalises Lassiter's Hotel with graffiti. Sergeant Matt Turner (Josef Brown) asks Ajay if he can question Rani, but Ajay refuses. Matt later informs him that Paul will not press charges and Ajay learns Priya spoke to him.
Ajay meets Phillipa Curtis (Louise Rocchi), who flirts with him. Ajay later goes home with her, but reveals to Priya that nothing happened between them. Priya asks Ajay to attend counselling with her and he initially refuses, but changes his mind. When Ajay learns that Priya is being harassed by Brian O'Loughlin (Paul Denny), he supports her and tells her he loves her. They reunite, but shortly afterwards Priya is critically injured following a gas explosion. Ajay and Rani are told that Priya will not wake up and they say their goodbyes. Ajay blames Paul for Priya's death and launches a civil action against him. When Ajay learns that the gas bottle that exploded came from faulty stock, he has to sue the gas supplier instead. Ajay notices that Rani is not coping with her mother's death and tries to help Rani her move on. When she realises that Priya did love her, she returns to her old self. Ajay approaches Toadie with the idea of them going into business together and Toadie agrees to open a practice with him.
Ajay agrees to defend Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) when he is arrested for attempted armed robbery. Mason briefly changes lawyers when Paul offers his for free. But when Toadie realises that Paul intends to get Mason sent down, Mason switches back to Ajay and Toadie. Ajay and Toadie's next client is Caroline Perkins (Alinta Chidzey), who is suing Paul for sexual harassment. When Ajay gives Caroline her bill, she comes on to him in the hope he will lower the price. Ajay rejects her advances and the case is later settled. Ajay finally receives a cheque from the gas supplier for $350,000 as compensation for Priya's death. Ajay and Rani decide to use some of the money to go to India. However, Ajay then learns that his grandmother is terminally ill and makes the decision to leave Australia immediately to be with her. He asks Karl and Susan to take in Rani, but she refuses to remain behind without him. Ajay and Rani then leave Ramsay Street. Rani returns a couple of months later to help pack up their belongings and she explains that Ajay has got a new job in London.
Reception.
Following the announcement that the Kapoor family would become regular cast members, staff had to remove several racist posts left on the "Neighbours" website. Bower said the inappropriate comments, which were from viewers expressing their anger at a non-Anglo-Saxon family being introduced to the show, came from a "small minority". She later commented that for every negative comment about the family there were ten to fifteen positive ones. Joab spoke out about the issue, blaming the racism on a "lack of education". He stated "There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St. Those Aussies who are saying it is un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White Australia policy back in the day, you are never going to get away from that kind of stuff." Joab added having a show, which portrays different families coming together could only be a good thing for the community. He later revealed that despite the few negative views, the audience reaction to the Kapoors had been "fantastic".
A writer for "What's on TV" called Ajay and Priya a "power couple". The "Herald Sun's" Cameron Adams branded Ajay "Paul's latest nemesis", while a "Sunday Mercury" reporter wondered if Paul had underestimated him. Another "Sunday Mercury" reporter thought Ajay had suffered "a crushing blow" during election day, before incurring the wrath of his wife for buying Number 24. Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, stated that "maybe Ajay does have a future in politics" when he forced how-to-vote cards on people while they were eating lunch. She added that "nothing could be more career-limiting" when Ajay agreed to shoot a video to help his campaign with Karl.
Butler later stated that she did not blame Priya for flirting with Paul as "her husband's a clown." In November 2012, Butler called Ajay "deluded". Jaci Stephen from the "Daily Mail" thought that Priya did not have to worry about Ajay finding out about her affair with Paul because "he's dozy enough to believe she has several late night meetings a week about school matters – all conducted at a hotel." A "Liverpool Echo" reporter called Ajay a "nice-but-boring dad". A writer for the "Sunday Mail" thought Ajay was "suffering as a result of Priya's death".

Quintus Marcius Crispus

Quintus Marcius Crispus (fl. 1st century BC) was a Roman senator and military officer who served under Julius Caesar during the civil wars of the late republic.
Biography.
A member of the Plebeian gens Marcia, Crispus had possibly been elected to the office of Aedile by 58 BC. He was then appointed as one of Lucius Calpurnius Piso’s "legati", serving in Macedonia from 57 BC to 56/55 BC. Sometime between 54 BC and 47 BC, Crispus was elected to the office of Praetor, and, although he had no strong political ties to him, by 46 BC, he was serving under Julius Caesar in North Africa as one of Caesar’s legates. During this portion of the campaign, he was given the responsibility of attacking the town of Thabena, which he then garrisoned after taking it.
In 45 BC, Crispus was made Proconsular governor of Bithynia et Pontus. In the following year, he took three legions to Syria, to provide aid to the Caesarean governor Lucius Staius Murcus who was fighting the pro-Pompeian former governor Quintus Caecilius Bassus. Together, they cornered Bassus at Apamea, and were acclaimed "Imperator" by their troops by early 43 BC.
In 43 BC, Crispus was replaced as governor of Bithynia, and his command over the three legions in Syria was stripped from him by Gaius Cassius Longinus, the new governor of Syria. Following this, he refused to serve under Cassius (unlike Staius Murcus), and temporarily retired from political life.
It has been conjectured that Crispus was the Quintus Marcius who was appointed suffect consul in 36 BC. If so, he replaced Marcus Cocceius Nerva as consul on 1 July 36 BC.

<doc id="36827846" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36827846" title="Objectivism's rejection of the primitive">
Objectivism's rejection of the primitive

Ayn Rand's Objectivism rejects an array of ideas and modes of living that it deems are primitive by nature and indicative of a primitive culture. Objectivism views primitive states of existence as being "savage" and marred in mysticism, fatalism, ignorance, superstition, poverty, passivity, and collectivism. The cure to such a society Objectivism holds is Western civilization, capitalism and modernity, which in its view brings with it reason, individualism, science, industrialization, and ultimately wealth.
Objectivists contend that Rousseauian romanticism of primitive life became the foundation for the 1960's counterculture and New Left, which Rand vehemently opposed. Two specific groups that Rand controversially accused of being primitive "savages" were Native Americans and Arabs. Rand also outlined her broader anti-primitive views in various speeches, interviews, and in her book "". Those anti-primitive views and their relevance to Objectivism have since been expounded on by individuals such as Leonard Peikoff and Michael Berliner, newsletters like "The Objectivist", and groups such as the Ayn Rand Institute and Atlas Society.
Objectivism contends that by upholding reason and the value of the individual, a culture is able to reject the "primitive mentality that cower(s) before the forces of nature" and "the dictates of mystical authorities." Peter Schwartz of the "Ayn Rand Institute" has argued that there is a push in the present day to restore the aforementioned "medieval mentality" under the guise of tribalism, multiculturalism, and environmentalism. Schwartz believes that this leads to an anti-science and anti-technology mentality, which becomes subservient to the "mysticism of religion." However, Frederick Cookinham in "The Age of Rand: Imagining an Objectivist Future World", hypothesizes that the "socialist/altruist claim that people lived in communist paradise and lived in harmony with the earth until modern white guys destroyed everything" will not stand against the evidence in the future.
Rousseau and the New Left.
According to the Objectivist-based Atlas Society, eighteenth century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau offered an "idealized image of primitive man" who had not yet been "corrupted by civilization." The source of such primitivist views according to the Atlas Society was Rousseau's "antipathy to reason", and his postmodern hatred of individualism and capitalism. In this respect, Objectivism views Rousseau, who praised the authenticity of primitive modes of life, as the father of the nineteenth-century Romantic poets, which the Atlas Society contends ultimately became the inspiration for the counterculture of the 1960s and the New Left. 
In surmising the New Left, Rand deemed that they could be summed up by the false accusation that "Capitalism defiles the beauty of your countryside." Furthermore, Rand predicted that following the Vietnam War, the New Left would disingenuously turn their "next big crusade" to the issue of pollution and clean air. However the true unstated goal of this crusade Rand believed was the destruction of capitalism and the "establishment of a global dictatorship."
The savage and tribal altruism.
Objectivism rejects the notion of the Noble savage, believing that they are mentally inferior. Founder of the Ayn Rand Institute Leonard Peikoff uses the example that if you were to "study savages in the jungle", you would find that they are mentally "undeveloped" and thus "have no method and no discovery of any control over their minds yet." Peikoff refers to such "savages" as "imagistic, pre-conceptual ... fear ridden, (and) emotional ridden", with a "primitive type of mind" comparable to a baby or an animal.
Rand states that "the morality of altruism" itself is primitive and "tribal phenomenon", rooted in the fact that in her view "prehistoric men were physically unable to survive without clinging to a tribe for leadership and protection against other tribes." In Rand's assessment, modern "theoreticians of altruism" such as Immanuel Kant, John Dewey, B.F. Skinner, and John Rawls were out to dominate our "magnificent scientific civilization" with the "morality of a prehistoric savagery."
Ecology and industrialization.
Rand rejected ecology "as a social principle", stating that it "condemns cities, culture, industry, technology, (and) the intellect" by advocating man's "return to nature,", which she described as "the state of grunting subanimals digging the soil with their bare hands." Referring to ecologists as propagandists and "vultures", Rand held that they envisioned a state of nature and natural harmony which placed man on the level of sea urchins or polar bears. Noting that man's life expectancy was around 30 years of age during the preindustrial Middle Ages, Rand recommended that "anyone over 30 years of age, give a silent "thank you" to the nearest, grimiest, sootiest smokestacks you can find."
Objectivism's societal examples of primitiveness.
Native Americans and colonization.
Rand's Objectivism rejects primitivism and tribalism, while arguing that they are symptomatic of an "anti-industrial" mentality. Rand believed that the indigenous Native Americans, who in her estimation exhibited these "savage" traits, thus forfeited their property rights in doing so. Rand also contended that Native Americans, "having failed for millennia to create a heroically productive capitalist society, deserved to be stripped of their land." When Rand addressed West Point Military Academy cadets in 1974 and was asked about the dispossession and "cultural genocide" of Native Americans which occurred en route to forming the United States, she replied that indigenous people "had no right to a country merely because they were born here and then acted like savages ... Since the Indians did not have the concept of property or property rights – they didn't have a settled society, they had predominantly nomadic tribal "cultures" – they didn't have rights to the land, and there was no reason for anyone to grant them rights that they had not conceived of and were not using." Rand went on to opine that "in opposing the white man" Native Americans wished to "continue a primitive existence" and "live like animals or cavemen", surmising that "any European who brought with him an element of civilization had the right to take over this continent."
On Columbus Day of 1992, Michael Berliner executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute reiterated this philosophical position and hailed the European conquest of North America, describing the indigenous culture as "a way of life dominated by fatalism, passivity, and magic." Western civilization, Berliner claimed, brought "reason, science, self-reliance, individualism, ambition, and productive achievement" to a people who were based in "primitivism, mysticism, and collectivism", and to a land that was "sparsely inhabited, unused, and underdeveloped." In a 1999 follow up editorial for "Capitalism magazine", Berliner, who was also senior advisor to the Ayn Rand Archives, expressed objectivism's "reverence" for Western Civilization which he referred to as an "objectively superior culture" that "stands for man at his best." In response to Michael Berliner's critiques of Native American society, Robert McGhee, an archaeologist with the Canadian Museum of Civilization, stated that the United States Constitution and its concept of democracy "may owe much, to the political concepts of the Iroquois and other Native peoples."
Additionally, in 2005, the Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights rejected a proposal by the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to formally apologize to Native Americans, stating that the proper response from "Indians" instead should be "gratitude." The Ayn Rand Center's remarks went on to decree the transfer of Western civilization to the Americas as "one of the great cultural gifts in recorded history, affording Indians almost effortless access to centuries of European accomplishments in philosophy, science, technology, and government", remarking that "before Europeans arrived, the scattered tribes occupying North America lived in abject poverty, ignorance, and superstition."
Arabs versus Israel.
Rand's rejection of what she deemed to be "primitivism" also extended to the Middle East peace process. Following the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, Rand denounced Arabs as "primitive" and "one of the least developed cultures" who "are typically nomads." Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being "the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent", while decreeing that "when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are."
When asked about the topic during a May 1979 episode of the "The Phil Donahue Show", Ayn Rand reprised her support for Israel against the Arabs under the reasoning that they were "the advanced, technological, civilized country amidst a group of almost totally primitive savages [...] who resent Israel because it’s bringing industry, intelligence, and modern technology into their stagnation."
Leonard Peikoff, who was associate editor with Ayn Rand for "The Objectivist", reiterated Rand's earlier stance in a 1996 editorial for "Capitalism Magazine", noting that "(Israeli) land was not stolen from the nomadic tribes meandering across the terrain, any more than the early Americans stole this country (the U.S.) from the primitive, warring Indians."
Libertarian reaction.
Jennifer Burns in her biography "", notes how Rand's position that "Native Americans were savages", and that as a result "European colonists had a right to seize their land because native tribes did not recognize individual rights", was one of the views that "particularly outraged libertarians." Burns also notes how Rand's position that "Palestinians had no rights and that it was moral to support Israel, the sole outpost of civilization in a region ruled by barbarism", was also a controversial position amongst libertarians, who at the time were a large portion of Rand's fan base.

Seed (The Walking Dead)

"Seed" is the twentieth episode and the premiere of the third season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC in the United States and in Canada on October 14, 2012. The episode was written by showrunner Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson. It is set six months after the second season finale and focuses on Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his group of survivors' discovering and entering the prison complex shown on the previous episode. Meanwhile, Michonne (Danai Gurira) cares for an ailing Andrea (Laurie Holden).
"Seed" is the first non extended-length premiere of "The Walking Dead". The episode received general critical acclaim, with many critics praising its return to form in levels of gore, tension and urgency. Many also noted it as an example of showrunner Glen Mazzara's promise for a "higher level of action", as seen in the earlier episodes of the series. The episode also featured the promotion of Michonne to a series regular from featured stand in.
Upon airing the episode garnered 10.9 million viewers, breaking several records not only for the series, but television history as well.
Plot.
After a herd of walkers overran Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson)'s farm at the end of the last season, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his group are now in search of a new home. Several months have passed, including winter, and Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) is due to give birth any day. After being chased out of an abandoned house by remnants of the herd which still infest the area, Rick and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go hunting for food and happen upon a prison complex. With the help of the other survivors, Rick manages to enter the prison courtyard. They lock themselves inside the first gate and kill all of the walkers within a fenced yard. Noting that the walkers they encountered were prison inmates and guards, Rick believes the prison fell early and thus could still hold a large supply cache. As the group settles in for the night, he urges them to continue onward into the prison in the morning.
Meanwhile, Andrea (Laurie Holden) has fallen severely ill since being separated from the group and being taken in by Michonne (Danai Gurira). Michonne has kept Andrea in a meat locker and encounters walkers while raiding a pharmacy to retrieve aspirin to reduce Andrea's fever. Andrea feels like a burden to Michonne and tells her to proceed without her, but Michonne refuses and sets out for a safer refuge with her.
The following day, Rick and the others manage to clear the prison yard, circling up back-to-back and moving as a unit to clear all the walkers in the enclosure. Daryl notes that one of the walkers they killed was a civilian, hinting at a possible breach of the prison's security. The group clears out a cell block to sleep in. Lori confides in Hershel, believing that her relationships with Rick and their son Carl are ruined. She also fears the baby is stillborn after feeling no movement, and worries that the baby might reanimate and devour her from the inside out, or that she could die during childbirth and endanger her family. Hershel calms her down and tries to get her to not worry about it. Rick, Daryl, Hershel, Glenn (Steven Yeun), Theodore "T-Dog" Douglas (IronE Singleton), and Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) go on a scouting mission to other parts of the prison. They forage through the pitch darkness with flashlights until further progress becomes impossible. They get split up after stumbling upon a cluster of walkers and Hershel, in an attempt to back up and locate the missing Glenn and Maggie, gets bitten on the leg by a seemingly "dead" walker. Rick chops off the bitten limb with a hatchet, in hopes that amputating the affected body part can stave off infection. As Hershel passes out from the pain and blood loss and Rick scrambles to find something to stop the bleeding, Daryl discovers they are not alone – there are five surviving prisoners watching them.

Sick (The Walking Dead)

"Sick" is the second episode of the third season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC in the United States on October 21, 2012.
Plot.
After amputating Hershel's right leg, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his group immediately rush an unconscious Hershel from the prison cafeteria as the five prisoners watch, astounded. Carol (Melissa McBride) and Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) immediately tend to Hershel while Rick, Daryl (Norman Reedus), and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) confront the prisoners who have followed them to their cell block. Rick learns that the prisoners have been shut away from the world for ten months and proceeds to describe the extent of the zombie pandemic. Rick and the prisoners come to an impasse when Tomas and Andrew try to claim rights to the prison; Rick prevails, asserting that the prison is his because his group spilled blood to clear it, while the prisoners were "locked in the broom closet". The two groups compromise to share the prison on the condition that the two groups never interact. Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog pledge to help the prisoners clear out their own cell block in exchange for half of the food remaining in the commissary's storeroom.
Rick's camp members console each other as Hershel remains in critical condition. Upon returning with the food, Rick advises handcuffing Hershel as a precaution in case he dies and reanimates, and he leaves Glenn to deal with that eventuality. Rick confides in Lori about the threat these prisoners may pose and contemplates killing them. Carl (Chandler Riggs) sneaks off alone to find the prison infirmary, brings back much-needed medical supplies, and is scolded by his mother. 
Rick arms the prisoners with blunt tools and explains how to go about combatting the walkers. Although the prisoners initially ignore Rick's instructions, they quickly become proficient. One prisoner, Big Tiny, breaks Rick's command and leaves formation, resulting in his being scratched on the back by a walker. The other prisoners advocate quarantining their friend, but their de facto leader, Tomas, brutally kills him. Upon arriving at a set of double doors leading to the promised cell block, Rick orders Tomas to open one door, in order to restrict the flow of walkers exiting the block. Tomas disobeys and opens both doors, flooding the area with walkers. In the ensuing chaos, he attempts to kill Rick with his axe and fails, then throws a walker at him–-claiming he merely reacted instinctively. Unmoved, Rick kills him and chases down Andrew, Tomas' right-hand man, who attempted to retaliate. Andrew finds himself in a courtyard full of walkers, and Rick locks him out of the re-entry door, advising him to run. 
At Carol's request, Glenn (Steven Yeun) escorts her to the prison yard, where she kills a female walker and uses its corpse to practice performing a C-section in preparation for Lori's pregnancy, in the event that Hershel does not recover. As Carol performs this trial surgery, she is being watched from a distance by an unknown figure. In Carol's absence, Hershel stops breathing, but Lori resuscitates him, saving his life. 
Upon returning, Rick shows mercy to the two remaining prisoners - Axel and Oscar, who had surrendered and appeared to be uninvolved in the plot against Rick's life – by sparing their lives and allotting them the cell block as promised. Rick's group leaves the prisoners with some parting words before returning to their own cell block. Hershel is showing positive signs of recovery and is conscious when Rick returns. Later on, Lori tries to strike up an intimate conversation with Rick, who simply thanks her for helping with Hershel, and then coldly walks away.

Walk with Me (The Walking Dead)

"Walk with Me" is the third episode of the third season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC in the United States on October 28, 2012. In this episode, Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) delivers Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) to The Governor (David Morrissey), and some of The Governor's dark secrets are revealed. Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), was previously seen in the flesh in season 1 and as an hallucination in season 2.
Plot.
The episode opens with a military helicopter flying over the countryside. However, the helicopter suffers mechanical problems and crashes into the forest. Michonne (Danai Gurira) and an ailing Andrea (Laurie Holden) witness the crash and investigate, finding two of the crew dead and the pilot, Welles, badly injured. They then hear vehicles approaching and hide. A small caravan of survivors arrives to inspect the wreckage. They rescue Welles and execute the dead crew, who are beginning to reanimate, while their leader mirrors Rick's philosophy of conserving ammunition against the walkers drawn to the crash. Michonne's walkers begin making noise, which attracts the survivors' attention, forcing Michonne to decapitate her walkers to keep them from exposing their presence. However, they are then apprehended by one of the survivors, who reveals himself to be Merle, who managed to escape from Atlanta. Merle has a bayonet strapped to a crude prosthetic in place of the hand he had to cut off to escape the rooftop where he was left handcuffed in the first season. A feverish Andrea then faints from shock.
Andrea and Michonne are taken to the town of Woodbury, where Merle interrogates them. Merle tells them how he managed to escape from Atlanta and made his way to Woodbury, where he has become The Governor's right-hand man. Andrea recounts her escape from Hershel's farm and how she was left behind, similar to Merle. Merle still shows resentment over being trapped and left for dead. The women are then introduced to The Governor, who shows the women how Woodbury is a secure sanctuary, with high walls and heavily armed guards. They also have plenty of supplies including food, water, and electricity. The Governor also reveals that people turn into walkers regardless of how they die and asks that they stay in town in order to recover. Michonne, however, is not impressed and wants her weapons returned so she can leave as soon as possible. However, Andrea convinces her to stay a little longer in order to learn more about the town. Meanwhile, The Governor interrogates Welles, who reveals that he was a part of a National Guard refugee camp. While they were well-supplied and protected, someone inside the camp turned into a walker and created a panic, causing the camp's defenses to fall from within; only a small squad of guardsmen survived this ordeal. Welles tells the Governor of their last known position and The Governor promises that if the men are still alive, he will find and rescue them.
The next morning, The Governor and his chief advisor, Milton Mamet, join Andrea and Michonne for breakfast with the intention of prying more information from them. Andrea is receptive to The Governor's charisma, but Michonne remains aloof during the conversation. Michonne expresses her distrust of The Governor and her intentions of leaving the community to Andrea, who is otherwise convinced that Woodbury is the perfect sanctuary. Outside Woodbury, The Governor tracks down the surviving National Guardsmen. However, instead of helping them, The Governor has his men ambush and kill all of the guardsmen, and then take their vehicles and supplies for themselves. Upon his return, The Governor tells the townspeople the guardsmen had already fallen to the walkers, and stresses how essential Woodbury is to their survival. 
That night, unable to sleep, The Governor opens a locked room in his house and goes inside, where he sits in an armchair and stares at aquarium tanks filled with decapitated walker heads, two of them the heads of Michonne's "pet" walkers, and another the head of Welles.

William Robertson Desobry

William Robertson Desobry (September 11, 1918 – January 12, 1996) was a senior U.S. Army field commander in Germany during the Cold War, and a Lieutenant General in the United States Army. General Desobry was a decorated hero from World War II, and played a significant role as an advisor to the Republic of Vietnam Army and on the Army Staff during the Vietnam War. In addition to commanding a division and corps, he was the Commanding General of the Armor Center and was the President of the XM-1 Tank Task Force.
After 34 years in the Army and service in two wars, Lieutenant General Desobry completed his military career in 1975.
Education.
Desobry received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1941 from Georgetown University, where he was a distinguished graduate of their Reserve Officer Training Corps program and earned a Regular Army commission.
Early life and career.
Born in Manila, the Philippine Islands in 1918, Desobry was the son of Colonel and Mrs. Elmer C. Desobry. He attended high schools in Chicago, Illinois, and Honolulu, Hawaii–graduating from Punahou Academy in 1936. John McManus described Desobry, "Rail-thin at six-feet-four and one-hundred-sixty pounds, he was the son of a career soldier. He qualified as something of a family rebel because he had elected to go to Georgetown University instead of West Point. He had graduated in 1941 with an ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) commission. Although
he had only been in the Army four years, he had deployed overseas as commander of the 20th Armored Infantry Battalion because of his natural leadership skills. His subsequent performance in combat only enhanced his fine reputation. Now he found himself in charge of 325 soldiers and fifteen tanks in a mixed task force generally known as 'Team Desobry.'"
World War II.
General Desobry’s service during World War II included a tour of duty with the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, Georgia and the 10th Armored Division in CONUS, and the European Theater of Operations. He commanded an armored infantry battalion task force during the defense of Bastogne, and was wounded and hospitalized by the Germans at Ibbenburen, Germany. He was liberated in the spring of 1945 after imprisonment at Falingbostel, Germany, a branch of the Belsen prison camp, and at Brunswick, Germany.
Charles MacDonald, noted Army historian and Battle of the Bulge veteran, described then Major Desobry's heroic actions in his 1997 book, "A Time for Trumpets". It is arguably the definitive account of this dramatic victory and displays the actions of Desobry and his armored-infantrymen, often in close combat and at times in hand-to-hand combat.
Post-war service.
Upon his return to the United States, Lieutenant Colonel Desobry served for short periods at Fort Rucker and Fort McClellan, Alabama and in G2, Department of the Army. In July 1946, he returned to Europe where he served as an Assistant G1 in Headquarters, Third Army and US Forces in Austria. 
He returned to Germany in 1955 and served as Commanding Officer, Combat Command C, 2d Armored Division, and later Chief of Staff, 2d Armored Division and G3, V Corps. Upon his return to the United States in 1958, he attended the National War College, graduating in 1959. He was then assigned to the Office Chief of Legislative Liaison, where he served for three years in the Plans and Projects Division.
In 1962 he was assigned to the faculty of the Army War College, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, where he served as a Course Director, Chairman of a Faculty Group, and the Chairman of the Department of Strategy.
Vietnam War.
From August 1965 to June 1966, Colonel Desobry was assigned to Headquarters Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MAC-V) with duty as Deputy Senior Advisor to the ARVN IV Corps in the delta region of Vietnam under Colonel George Barton. On June 3, 1966, Brigadier General Desobry assumed duties as the Senior Advisor to the ARVN IV Corps. Desobry and his advisory teams were involved in four campaigns during his two and a half years tour: Defense; and Counter-Offensive Phases 1-3. IV Corps was the southernmost of the four major military and administrative units of South Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s. Its headquarters were located at Cần Thơ in the Mekong Delta. Also known as Military Region 4 (MR 4), IV Corps was the fourth allied tactical combat zone. Because of the nature of its terrain, and more important, its geographical isolation from major North Vietnamese strongholds, the Delta area had generally been infiltrated by enemy guerrilla or small force rather than large force bands. Thus, except for the Mobile 3 Riverine Force and small Special Forces units, no U.S. troops had normally operated in the area until Operation Deckhouse V in 1967 when the U.S. 9th Infantry Division initiated two years of intensive antiguerrilla activities. Otherwise, MR 4 had been and continued to be primarily a Vietnamese area of operations. Brigadier General Desobry turned over his duties to Major General George S. Eckhardt, and left Vietnam on January 14, 1968, only three weeks before the Tet Offensive.
Cold War service.
Following over two years as Senior Advisor to the ARVN IV Corps, Brigadier General Desobry became the Director of Army Operations, The Army Staff.
Major General Desobry then served as Commanding General of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas from 1969 to 1971.
In 1971, he became the Commanding General of the Armor Center and Armor School at Fort Knox, Kentucky. While there, he was appointed President of the XM-1 Tank Task Force.
In 1968, Desobry returned to Washington, D. C. where he served as a member of the Department of the Army Board of Inquiry on the Army Logistics System; the Chief of the Coordination Division, Office of the Chief of Staff, and subsequently as Executive Officer to the Vice Chief of Staff, U. S. Army.
On June 1, 1973, Lieutenant General Desobry assumed command of V Corps at Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany from Lieutenant General Willard Pearson. He was responsible for the training and readiness of V Corps, headquartered at Abrams Barracks, which included the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized) "Pathfinder," the 3rd Armored Division "Spearhead," and the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment "Blackhorse." Major General Joseph C. McDonough. commanded the "Pathfinder" Division, which was headquartered at Rose Barracks, Bad Kreuznach. Major General (later Lieutenant General) Jonathon R. Burton commanded the "Spearhead" Division headquartered at Frankfurt. Colonel Robert L. Schweitzer (1973-1974) and Colonel (later Lieutenant General) John L. Ballantyne III (1974-1976) commanded the "Blackhorse” Regiment headquartered at Fulda.
Desobry turned over command of V Corps to Lieutenant General Robert L. Fair on August 24, 1975.
Retirement.
Lieutenant General Desobry continued to support the Armor community after his retirement from Army. As a result, he received the U.S. Cavalry and Armor Association's Gold Medallion Winners Hall of Fame in 1989.
Desobry died on January 12, 1996 in San Antonio, Texas. He is buried at the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery
Personal life.
General Desobry was married to the former Jacqueline Keyes of Tucson, Arizona, on August 22, 1942. They had six children.
Mrs. Desobry died in San Antonio on September 10, 2011.

Scientifics contributions.
Julio Moizeszowicz development psychopharmacological investigations trying to complement the relationships between the body and mind, articulated through the psychotherapies, the psychoanalysis and psychopharmacological treatments, in different mental disorders.
In his writings he states, that the quantitative invasion (psychological and chemical), disorganize the psychic apparatus, being necessary the administration of psychoactive drugs to restore the order of the quality and the representations.
It has been demonstrated that besides the genetic factors, emotional factors may cause changes in quantity and quality of the brain neurotransmitters.
To the quantitative invasion of the mental apparatus, should be added, the human inability to respond to it properly. It is, because the limited possibilities of controlling and elaborate mentally psychic excitements. An excessive influx of excitement, canceled the pleasure principle at once, forcing the psychic apparatus to perform a more urgent task: to link the excitations to allow its subsequent discharge. In order to act, the principle requires that certain conditions are fulfilled, which are canceled by the psychological trauma.
Sigmund Freud, in his book "Project for a Scientific Psychology", (1895), confirms the concept of "a quantity of arousal which moves along the neural networks". At the time of the discovery of human hormones, Freud adds in "Outline of Psychoanalysis" (1938), that "it is possible to act chemically on the psychic apparatus".
Today it is known, that every neuron propagates its information through an action potential (electrical signal) and synapses are governed by neurotransmitters. The flow of information is transmitted inside neurons from dendrites in the body of the neuron and from there to the axon. To continue the propagation of impulses within neurons, the electrical impulse is converted into chemicals. This release of neurotransmitters in the synaptic gap (stored in vesicles), allows the intervention of psychotropic drugs.
These neurotransmitters are "captured" by cell surface receptors, which generate an excitatory postsynaptic potential, in order to transmit the impulse again to another cell. In order to maintain permanent changes over time is necessary to store that information. This is done, primarily, through the basic structures messengers (messenger RNA). In this way the original message can be fixed in the nucleus of the neuron, where the DNA encoding it definitively to remain in memory (neuronal plasticity).
Eric Kandel (Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2000), demonstrated the existence of a genetic memory. Now, it is possible to differentiate between genetic and epigenetic in mental disorders. This is performed through intracellular chemical messengers (signal transduction), which attempt to modify the activity of genes.
From Freudian theory, psychosis means that a quantitative attack of impulses cannot be qualified. This invasion of emotions produces psychotic disorders: the Ego merges with the Id, away from the outside world. If on the contrary the Ego takes alliance with the outside world, but cannot prevail over the Id will be generated the neurotic disorders. If the conflict is done through the Superego, depression appears. The presence of over-adaptation to reality, will lead to psychosomatic diseases. This strong invasion to the mental apparatus can produce in neurotic patients, intense accesses of anxiety, for example, can generate panic attacks; in psychosis patients can cause a psychotic breakdown, with a complete loss, of the labile restorative construction (which allowed the patient to "live" until that moment).
Since 1950, with the synthesis of the typical antipsychotic (chlorpromazine) and the antidepressant (imipramine), Psychopharmacology advances at a dizzying rate, taking advantage of the progress of other sciences. At present, there are methods to investigate chemical and psychological responses of the central nervous system, through the neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and computed tomography single-photon emission tomography), the neurochemistry and the bioelectricity.
The psychoactive drugs may be regarded as an object, which acts when the words (the order of the quality and the representations), disappear, as a consequence of a quantitative invasion of the mental apparatus. Are also useful in the prophylactic phases of these mental disorders, with painful vital conflicts, like separations, bereavement, job losses, etc., which can result in acute quantitative responses, usually known in advance, by family and psychotherapists.
It is recommended that the patient take the medication correctly (compliance), and reach an agreement, through a therapeutic relationship, where the doctor can clarify to the patient, the benefits, as well as the balance of risks, of psychotherapies and psychopharmacological medications.

Miklos Suba

Miklos Suba (1 April 1880 – 18 July 1944) was an Hungarian-born American artist. Trained as an architect, he devoted his time to both architecture and art until 1940 when he dedicated the remainder of his life to painting subject matter in Brooklyn, New York. He is classified as a member of the precisionism movement.
Biography.
Miklos Suba was born in Szatmár, Hungary in 1880. He was educated in architecture at the Royal Hungarian Technical University of Budapest, graduating in 1902. He also studied painting at the Vienna Academy in 1903 and later traveled and painted throughout England, France, Holland and Italy. He returned to Budapest to work as an architect over the next two decades. During this time he met and married his wife, May, an American pianist. The couple gave birth to their daughter, Susanne Suba, in 1913.
He immigrated to the United States from Hungary in 1924 and resided with his wife May and daughter at 142 Montague Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights. During this time he continued to devote time to both architecture and painting. He lived in Brooklyn Heights for the remainder of his life, later at 24 Sidney Place and finally at 69 Willow Street. With the exception of a single visit back to Hungary and a three week stay in Chicago, he spent the rest of his life in Brooklyn. Suba died on 18 July 1944 after a brief illness. He is buried with his wife in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.
Career.
During Suba's time in Budapest, he painted in a traditional central European style. However, Suba's adopted city impacted a major shift in painting style from countrysides and landscapes to industrial subject matter. The rendering of buildings with clean lines and exact detail caused him to be grouped with Precisionist artists. Suba's work depicts industrialization and modernization, rendered in precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Of his work, Suba commented, "I try to express my realistic impressions without involking abstraction... I am neither photographic nor reminiscent.
Suba restricted his paintings and drawings to areas within Brooklyn, often within walking distance of his residence. As shown in his works, Suba had an intimate relationship with his Brooklyn; from its alleys and waterways to its storefronts and industrial plants, as well as its views of Manhattan. Occasionally, he departed from his routine subject matter to others that fascinated him: barber shops, barber's poles and cigar store Indians. Suba created scale models of barbershop poles from various locations in Brooklyn, and these models were featured in an exhibit of his work at the Brooklyn Museum in 1948. The Brooklyn Historical Society maintains a collection of twelve of Suba's scale-model barbershop poles, including working drawings and maps of the pole's locations. He incorporated barber poles in many of his paintings.

General debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly

The general debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly speaking schedule in the General Assembly Chamber from 25 September 2012 were as follows:
Organisation and subjects.
The order of speakers is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies. Any other observers entities will have a chance to speak at the end of the debate, if they so choose. Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to faciltate translation and to be presented at the podium. Though there is no time limit for speeches, a voluntary guideline of 15 minutes is requested.
In addition to commenting on issues of individual national and wider international relevance, the President of the General Assembly Vuk Jeremić chose the theme: "Adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means." Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also said: "This year's General Debate will be among our busiest ever. This reflects the tumultuous time in which we live -- a time of turmoil and transition." The General Debate will commence with the opening of the session on 25 September and continue until 1 October.
26 September.
Right of Reply.
Member states have the option to reply to comments on the day (or even to the days prior), but are limited to 10 minutes for the first response and five minutes for the second response. All speeches are made from the floor, as opposed to the podium for the General Debate.
Iran responded to Kuwait's assertion of UAE sovereignty over the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa. The delegate added that Iran was willing to talk over the issue to avoid misunderstanding, but added that sovereignty was non-negotiatable. He further added that the international name of the body of water for the Persian Gulf was misrepresented as the Arabian Gulf.
27 September.
Right of Reply.
Iran responded to Netanyahu. Japan responded to China, China reciprocated and both used their second right of reply as well.
28 September.
Right of Reply.
Bolivia responded to Chile's comments about the maritime dispute, which Chile then countered. Then North Korea responded to the South Korean comments about its nuclear weapons programme. Iran then responded to claims of sovereignty over the islands by the UAE, and in Arab solidarity over the issue, as well as the Persian Gulf naming controversy. Bolivia took the stand again and was duly followed by Chile. UAE followed up its counter points to Iran's reply; it was then followed, in turn, by Iran's rebuttal and UAE closed out the session in its second reply. 
1 October.
Right of Reply.
Pakistan responded to India's claim to Kashmir. Iran then responded to a "Western delegation" statement on its nuclear issue and criticised Israel. Azerbaijan responded to Armenia's comments and was then, in turn, replied to by Armenia. Eritrea then responded to Djibouti before Pakistan replied to India's reply and was then followed by Azerbaijan. At second responses, India briefly rebutted Pakistan's comment, before Armenia responded to Azerbaijan. President of the session, Vuk Jeremić, then closed out the meeting. 
Sideline events.
During the events around the General Debate, the Contact Group for Syria was scheduled to meet, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, whose country recently invited Iran to join the group, who was speaking alongside Turkey's Ahmet Davutoğlu and Iran's Ali Akbar Salehi. Salehi added: "To expect a quick solution from one meeting is unrealistic. We must be patient. But I confirm to you that the things we agree on are greater than our differences. could table a proposal that we hope, God willing, will produce a result that satisfies everyone...But this needs more talks." The UN-Arab League envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi said he would make his next report to the Security Council and Arab ministers who will be attending for the General Debate. The meeting on 26 September, unnamed Arab foreign ministers met Brahimi. Tunisia's President Moncef Marzouki then suggested "a peacekeeping operation by Arab nations is something we could well imagine. We have really pushed for a peaceful solution, but if it is necessary, it must be an Arab peacekeeping force, yes." He also called Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "a bloodthirsty dictator." The previous day, though Qatar's Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani told the General Debate of an Arab intervention, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said he did not interpret this as a "fighting force" and added that he told the UNSC it must support Brahimi by enforcing its resolutions on Syria as "binding on all parties."
In regards to the Senkaku Islands dispute and the recent purchase by Japan of three uninhabited islands from a private Japanese citizen which also led to anti-Japanese protests in China, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told his Japanese counterpart Kōichirō Genba on 25 September that Japan had "severeinfringement" its sovereignty. He added that China–Japan relations would remain strained until the purchase was reversed. A statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry later read: "The Chinese side will by no means tolerate any unilateral action by the Japanese side on the Diaoyu Islands ." The same day, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said after the UNGA meeting: "So far as the Senkaku islands are concerned, they are an integral part of our territory in the light of history and of international law. It is very clear and there are no territorial issues as such. Therefore there cannot be any compromise that could mean any setback from this basic position. I have to make that very clear. The resolution of this issue should not be by force, but calmly, through reason and with respect for international law." The dispute re-arose after Yang spoke about the issue at the General Debate and Japan then responded during the Right of Reply and was countered by China, leading to rebuttal by Japan and another statement by China.
At the same time, on the first day of the General Debate, discussion involved the recently passed controversy over "Innocence of Muslims" and the violent protests that followed. Discussions included how to regulate freedom of speech in regards to religious sensitivities and where to make some speech illegal. Opponents suggested such proposals for regulation could be misused in order to silence dissent. Similarly, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan added during his speech that religious denigration and incitement should not occur. U.S. President Barack Obama also condemned the video, but added such violent protests that led to deaths should also be condemned. Yemen's Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi also condemned the film and the violent protsts, while also criticising the facade of freedom of expression that is cited to produce such films. Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf also criticised the incitement to Muslims, as did Egypt's Mohamed Morsi in criticising Islamophobia and calling the release of the video as an "organised campaign against Islamic sanctities" which requires a "firm stand." At the same time, he called for rejecting violent protests. They were joined by Kuwait's Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah who criticised the violent protests and the incitement, while mentioning Kuwaiti's Emir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah's call for keeping all religious symbols above the purview of freedom of express. Australia's Julia Gillard added: "Denigration of religious beliefs is never acceptable...However, our tolerance must never extend to tolerating religious hatred and incitement to violence. The sentiment was echoed by Guatemala's Otto Pérez Molina, Latvia's Andris Bērziņš, Belgium's Elio Di Rupo, Niger's Mohamed Bazoum, Romania's Titus Corlățean, Bosnia and Herzegovina's Bakir Izetbegović, Comoros' Ikililou Dhoinine, Brunei Darussalam's Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, Maldives' Mohammed Waheed Hassan, Albania's Bujar Nishani, Antigua and Barbuda's Winston Baldwin Spencer, Lebanon's Najib Mikati, Greece's Dimitris Avramopoulos, Bahrain's Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, Saint Lucia's Kenny Davis Anthony, Turkey's Ahmet Davutoğlu
São Tomé and Príncipe's Patrice Emery Trovoada, Morocco's Moulay Rachid, Saudi Arabia's Saud Al-Faisal, UAE's Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Azerbaijan's Elmar Mammadyarov, Oman's Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla, India's S. M. Krishna, Djibouti's Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, Costa Rica's Enrique Castillo, Botswana's Phandu T. C. Skelemani and Sierra Leone's J. B. Dauda.
While some said violence is never recourse to the right to free speech; and other said religious should not be abused; yet others called for the inviobility of diplomatic missions to be respected in line with the Vienna Convention.
Myanmar's Thein Sein met U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the sidelines of the summit. She announced the lifting of some sanctions against his country, namely the allowing of imports from the former to the latter after support for the move from the government and the opposition in Myanmar. In turn Sein thanked her and the U.S. saying the gesture was approved by his people.
Under the behest of Saudi Arabia, a "Friends of Yemen" summit was held to support new Yememi President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi's call for a national dialogue in his country amidst the 2011–2012 Yemeni uprising.
A high-level discussion was also held amongst member states, the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs and NGO's on the topic of "Women, disarmament, non-prolifertation and arms control" during the first week of the General Debate. A joint statement was signed by all members for promoting the equitable representation of women in decision-making; and a General Assembly resolution is expected during this session.

Lincoln in Dalivision

Lincoln in Dalivision is an original limited edition lithograph created by Salvador Dalí. It is often considered one of the most counterfeited Dalí lithographs. Dalí authentication experts who have noted the counterfeiting issue with this work include Albert Field (The Official Catalog of Graphic Works of Salvador Dalí – authorized by Dalí), Frank Hunter (Dalí Archives – authorized by Dalí), Robert Descharnes (French photographer, long term friend and associate of Salvador Dalí) and Bernard Ewell (Bernard Ewell Art Appraisals, LLC). Lee Catterall comments in his book "The Great Dalí Art Fraud & other deceptions," "The painting most commonly reproduced for such fraudulent purposes was Lincoln in Dalivision, 'prints' of which Los Angeles art appraiser Dena Hall testified in the Hawaii trial have become as commonplace as 'pancakes at the pancake house.'"
"Lincoln in Dalivision" was created based on the Dalí painting "Gala looking at the Mediterranean Sea which at a distance of 20 meters is transformed into the portrait of Abraham Lincoln" "(Homage to Rothko)." Dalí painted two original versions of this painting spanning from 1974 – 1976, which are similar but not exactly the same. The first resides in the Museum in Figueras, Spain. The second resides in the permanent collection of The Salvador Dalí Museum in Saint Petersburg, Florida. This painting is the basis for the "Lincoln in Dalivision" lithograph. Prior to the acquisition by The Salvador Dalí Museum, the painting resided in Japan.
Significance of "Lincoln in Dalivision".
Dalí's paintings "Gala looking at the Mediterranean Sea which at a distance of 20 meters is transformed into the portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko)," and the original "Lincoln in Dalivision" lithographs produced from these paintings were some of the first examples of the photomosaic artistic approach by a recognized artist. ""The Recognition of Faces," by Leon Harmon" "(Scientific American, November 1973)" was the first published work on photomosaic concepts. Harmon was a Bell Labs researcher who had been developing this concept, and the first image in this article was the well recognized portrait of Abraham Lincoln from the U.S. five dollar bill made from a collection of solid gray mosaics. Dalí began his first painting that led to "Lincoln in Dalivision" in 1974 and finished the version that would be used for "Lincoln in Dalivision" in 1976. Harmon's Lincoln mosaic was the basis for all of Dalí's Lincoln photomosaics, which is evident by comparing the solid gray mosaics from Harmon's paper and the final works of art by Dalí.
Dalí's paintings "Gala looking at the Mediterranean Sea which at a distance of 20 meters is transformed into the portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko)" was completed in 1976 and displayed at The Guggenheim in New York during the US Bicentennial in 1976. "Lincoln in Dalivision" was originally intended for release in the same year, but was not finalized until 1977. Dalí moved to the US in 1940 when German troops entered Bordeaux, France. He remained in the US until 1948, then returned to Spain upon the conclusion of World War II. Dalí spent significant time in the US, even after returning to Spain.
"Lincoln in Dalivision" published editions.
"Lincoln in Dalivision " was primarily published by Levine & Levine in New York in 1977. All editions were signed and numbered, with the exception of those marked HC. Total production was 1240 "lithographs" in the following editions:
The prints were originally sold at a price of $750 and a small viewing optic lens in a blue case was included with the purchase. While viewing photomosaics by squinting your eyes is common today, the optic piece was included to help viewers see the Lincoln illusion from close range.
Due to the extensive counterfeiting and forgeries of Dalí's signature, "Lincoln in Dalivision," expert authentication is usually required to confirm authenticity of this work. Many experts who can typically authenticate various works via pictures and measurements only, require viewing "Lincoln in Dalivision" in person before they will authenticate the piece. Frank Hunter of the Dalí Archives requires that he views this work in person before providing a statement of authenticity. 
For a "print" released in a rather large quantity of 1240, "Lincoln in Dalivision" is a surprisingly rare work to come up for auction at major auction houses. Artnet.com shows only a handful of "Lincoln in Dalivision" sales by auction houses over the past decade. 
Respected galleries, including The Salvador Dalí Gallery (California) do list "Lincoln in Dalivision" in their inventory from time to time. Prices for authenticated works are often listed at prices ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 (per a search of publicly displayed prices on gallery websites done in 2012). Those with authentication by Albert Field or Frank Hunter appear to carry a slight premium in pricing to other pieces deemed authentic by galleries or other authentication experts.
"Lincoln in Dalivision" is often referred to as a "print" or "lithograph." However, neither of these are technically correct, as these terms have specific meanings when referring to original works of art that are created in limited editions. Lincoln in Dalivision is truly a mixed media artwork. It is technically a photolith with original etched remarque (Torrents) and embossing. While the photolith is from the painting, the etched remarque and embossing does make "Lincoln in Dalivision" an original Dalí. Additionally, the signature of Dalí and the numbering of the limited editions also establishes these works as originals. "Lincoln in Dalivision" is listed in Albert Field's "The Official Catalog of Graphic Works of Salvador Dalí – authorized by Dalí" as an original work and is viewed as such by galleries worldwide.

David Smith (rower)

David Smith MBE (born 21 April 1978) is a British adaptive rower who won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.
Personal life.
Smith was born on 21 April 1978 in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland. He was born with a club foot and for the first three years of his life he had his bones repeatedly broken and reset to correct his foot's alignment.
In 2010 he underwent emergency surgery after doctors found a tumour inside his spinal cord at cervical spine level. The surgery left him temporarily paralysed, an issue that was later determined to be the result of a blood clot.
He graduated from the University of Bath in 2009 with a Bachelors Degree in sports performance.
Rowing.
Smith was introduced to adaptive rowing in 2009 at a Paralympic Potential Day run by the British Paralympic Association. He competes in the legs, trunks and arms adaptive mixed coxed four (LTAMix4+) event in which he won a gold medal at the 2009 World Rowing Championships, competing in a crew with Vicky Hansford, Naomi Riches, James Roe and cox Rhiannon Jones. 
In 2011 he competed at the at World Rowing Championships held at Lake Bled, Bled, Slovenia. He won the gold medal in the LTAMix4+ event alongside crewmates Pam Relph, Naomi Riches, James Roe and cox, Lily van den Broecke. They completed the one kilometre course in a time of three minutes, 27.10 seconds, finishing nearly five seconds ahead of runners-up Canada. The result qualified a boat for Great Britain into the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. The crew repeated their gold medal result at the Munich World Cup event in 2012.
Smith was selected along with Relph, Riches, Roe, and van den Broeke, to compete for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the mixed coxed four event. The event took place between 31 August and 2 September at Eton Dorney. The Great Britain crew won gold.
Smith was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to rowing.

Papat Limpad 2012

Papat Limpad 2012 () is a Javanese Language Wikipedia Revitalization Project conducted in the year 2012-2013. Papat Limpad 2012 is a follow-up project to revitalize Javanese Wikipedia. Learning from best practice and lessons learned in a previous project called Papat Limpad, Wikimedia Indonesia designed a combined systematic effort to do outreach with writing classes and writing drives in the form of competition in Javanese-language Wikipedia. The project expands to three cities and approaches six universities to join the competition. The writing classes are expected to net a group of much more experienced and smarter new editors to compete against each other, and will benefit Javanese-language Wikipedia by increasing the number of new editors and the number of high-quality Javanese-language encyclopedia articles. The intervention is aimed at increasing the number of Javanese Wikipedia contributors up to a critical mass where the community could sustain itself and grow. Wikimedia Indonesia believes critical mass is reached when it is sustained at a minimum of 20 very active contributors without competition. So the success of the project can only be seen after the event. In 2011 a similar project was done using one university intervention. As a result, the Javanese Wikipedia readership climbed to 2.5 million readers in October 2011, and dropped back to 1.6 million in April 2012, a level similar to that of the situation before intervention happened. Compared to Indonesian Wikipedia, where each intervention increased the readership (by/to?) 10 million and the number had the tendency to stay, until the next intervention, in a small-language Wikipedia such as Javanese Wikipedia, the readership rate dropped the minute the number of contributors dropped.
Therefore Wikimedia Indonesia prioritized Javanese Wikipedia intervention and put most of its resources to do this one program, making sure it is up and running. Wikimedia Indonesia figures that a minimum of three interventions in three years will do the trick, before helping Wikipedia versions in other languages of Indonesia.
This project is co-funded by Wikimedia Indonesia, and Wikimédia France and Switzerland Wikimedia.

Roscoea × beesiana

"Roscoea" × "beesiana" is considered to be a hybrid between "R. auriculata" and "R. cautleyoides" which occurred in cultivation. The flowers are variable: most forms have a pale cream base colour with varying amounts of purple streaking, particularly on the lip or labellum. It was given the Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society in 2011. It is classified as being hardy throughout the British Isles.
Description.
Like all members of the genus "Roscoea", it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, "pseudostems" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. "R." × "beesiana" is usually 48–60 cm tall, with seven to nine leaves, of which at most the lowest one consists only of a sheath. Each leaf has a small ligule, extending to about 1–2 mm. The blade of the leaf (the part free from the pseudostem) is usually 8–29 cm long (occasionally as little as 4 cm long) by 2.1–4.5 cm wide. There are small "ears" at the junction of the blade and sheath (i.e. the leaf is somewhat auriculate). The leaf sheath has reddish markings.
The flower spike, which has 9–17 flowers, emerges from the leaf sheaths on a stalk (peduncle) visible for up to 3 cm. The flowers are basically cream, with varying amounts of purple streaking and marking, particularly on the labellum, which may be almost entirely purple. Green bracts, flushed with red, surround the flowers, and are about the same length as the calyx.
Each flower has the typical structure for "Roscoea" (see that article for labelled images). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx, 5.0–5.4 cm long, pale red in colour, with a two-toothed apex. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a tube 5.0–5.4 cm long, terminating in three lobes: an upright hooded central lobe, 3.8–4.2 cm long by 1.6-2.0 cm wide, and two very slightly shorter and much narrower side lobes. Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes): two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small upright petals, 1.8–2.0 cm long by 0.8–0.9 cm wide; two central staminodes are fused at the base to form a lip or labellum, 4.2–4.5 cm long and 3.2 cm wide. This is split at the end for about two thirds of its length into two lobes.
The single functional stamen has a linear white anther with a pointed yellow spur formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther.
"R." × "beesiana" differs from its putative parents in flower colour and in several other ways. It has a more deeply divided labellum than "R." "auriculata", whose labellum is either unlobed or lobed to less than half its length. Unlike "R." "cautleyoides", it has leaves with small "ears" at the junction of the blade and sheath and larger bracts, over rather than under 6 cm long.
Origin and taxonomy.
"R." × "beesiana" is considered to be a hybrid between "R. auriculata" and "R. cautleyoides", but its precise origin is unknown. The epithet "beesiana" is derived from a plant nursery in England called Bees Ltd, founded by Arthur K. Bulley, well-known as a plant enthusiast in the late 19th and early 20th century. However there is no evidence that the hybrid occurred there; the first mention of the name is in 1970, "long after the heyday" of the nursery. The name was not formally published until 2009, when Jill Cowley and Christopher Whitehouse provided a description and Latin diagnosis. It has also been known under the cultivar name "Roscoea" 'Beesiana', an invalid name under the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants, which does not allow Latin words as cultivar names after 1958.
Cultivation.
Coming from monsoon areas, roscoeas are used to wet summers and dry winters. Moisture retentive but well-drained soils are recommended, with limited exposure to hot sun, although "R." × "beesiana" has proved more tolerant than others in cultivation.
Cultivar Group names have been used to classify forms by the amount of purple on the labellum:
In addition, a form with a paler, almost white base colour and only a small amount of purple streaking has been given the cultivar name 'Monique'. "R." × "beesiana" was included in a trial of "Roscoea" held by the Royal Horticultural Society from 2009 to 2011. It proved hardy (rating H4 on the scale then in use, i.e. hardy anywhere in the British Isles). All the cultivars performed well and the hybrid was given the Award of Garden Merit.

In 1970 Dofner was inducted to the International Swimming Hall of Fame.
Her record in 100 yards was 1:06.2. Besides that she also held US records in the 40 yd, 50 yd, 60 yd, 80 yd and 220 yd and was a US champion in the 50 yd (1916), 100 yd (1916-1918), 220 yd (1917) yd and 440 yd (1917) freestyle events. She did not participate in Summer Olympics due to World War I, and then due to childbirth in 1920.
According to the findagrave website she was born to Anton Dorfner (1857–?) and Emelia Valetton Dorfner (1864–1943), and married Harry E Schoenhut (October 1, 1889 – September 1, 1952) in 1919. She started swimming in a club in 1914. After winning the national championships of 1916 she was presented with a vase featuring her portrait. Dorfner personally donated the vase to the museum of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1970.

Moaning sandbar

Moaning sandbars are harbor shoals that are known for tidal noises and participate, in English-speaking culture, in metaphors, associations, and phrases such as "moaning of the bar", connect these sounds with mortal danger. Water flowing over a sandbar, typically around low tide can coincide with both low, sustained noises and turbulence dangerous for smaller boats. 
In the mid-19th-century, the phrase "the harbor bar be moaning" in the poem and lyric "Three Fishers" connected working-class suffering to the noises.
Later in that century, Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote "Crossing the Bar", coupling "Let there be no moaning of the bar" with images of life's end, and then designated it as essentially his own requiem. This came soon after his making a trying sea journey. It is speculated that on the same trip, he may have heard such sounds at Salcombe, which has had a long history of wrecks; that idea is enhanced by the disaster, three decades later, on the Salcombe bar—with a fatality rate of 87% among the rescuers sent out aboard the town's lifeboat "The William and Emma".

Open Your Heart (album)

Open Your Heart is the third studio album by the Brooklyn punk rock band The Men, released March 6, 2012 on Sacred Bones Records. The album saw a change in sound for The Men, being less aggressive than the band's previous album "Leave Home" and incorporating influences from classic rock, country music and surf-rock. The album received mostly positive reviews.
Recording and release.
"Open Your Heart" was recorded in the summer of 2011 at Python Patrol studio. "Open Your Heart" was almost finished when "Leave Home," The Men's second album, was released. The album cover came from a stag magazine, with the vulgar elements in the background blacked-out.
The album was first announced on December 14, 2011. The first song released from the album, "Open Your Heart," premiered online on January 24, 2012. A second song from "Open Your Heart," "Ex-Dreams," was released February 17, 2012.
Musical styles.
"Open Your Heart" has been described as more "toned down" and psychedelic than "Leave Home." The album incorporated country music, doo-wop, krautrock and surf rock elements into the music. For specific bands, writers have cited Foo Fighters, MC5, The Replacements, Spacemen 3, Sonic Youth, No Age, Yo La Tengo, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath as artists of comparison. In an interview, the band said they were listening heavily to John Fahey, Leo Kottke, Cheap Trick, Big Star, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan's "Street Legal" while recording the album. Vocalist Mark Perro attributed "Open Your Heart's" new sound to the band having more time to write and record.
Reception.
"Open Your Heart" has received mostly positive reviews. On Metacritic, the album has a score of 83 out of 100, indicating "Universal acclaim."
Jason Heller of The A.V. Club gave the album a grade of A, writing "With "Open Your Heart," The Men have taken that breath. And it’s only made their hearts beat faster." Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen gave the album a Best New Music designation, writing ""Open Your Heart" is smartly sequenced to metabolize genre and morph like a masterful DJ mix, subtly rationing out its true peaks even while seemingly going full-throttle throughout." Cohen concluded: "f you bought their t-shirt, came to their show, raved about "Leave Home" on your Tumblr, or seek to carry on tradition by starting your own band, "Open Your Heart" is the Men thanking you in the best way possible." In another positive review, Rob Harvilla of Spin wrote ""Open Your Heart" improves the band's focus even as it widens its range, ditching the harrowing, hacking-death-cough stuff and reaching for something more… let's say 'pastoral.'"
Emma Sundstrom of Popmatters was more mixed to the album, calling the track "Candy" "annoying" and the album's longer songs "hit and miss." Sundstrom concluded: "At the end of the day, the Men aren’t quite all they’re cracked up to be, but even a bitter cynic like me has to admit, this album is worth a listen. It’s too watered down to stand the test of time, but right now, it hits the spot."
Pitchfork Media ranked "Open Your Heart" #30 on its list of the best album of 2012, with Ian Cohen writing: "It’s risky to use their studio albums to say anything definitive about the Men at this point. So let’s just forget about narratives and evolution and appreciate Open Your Heart as a record that makes them sound capable of doing whatever the hell they want. It cycles through barnstorming classic rawk, searing punk, beer-chugging country, and muscular krautrock. If you basically like any kind of music made with guitars, there’s something for you here." The same website ranked the title track #40 on its list of the top 100 tracks of 2012. The album was listed 17th on Stereogum's list of top 50 albums of 2012.

Murder of Faiza Ashraf

Faiza Ashraf was a 26-year old Pakistani-Norwegian woman who was kidnapped on 3 February 2010 from a bus-stop at Høvik in Bærum, outside of Oslo, while on her way to work. She was later found murdered. After receiving a distress call from Ashraf, the police arrested Shamrez Khan, and later Håvard Nyfløt who since admitted to kidnapping Ashraf on the orders of Khan. Both men were convicted and sentenced to prison. Known as the "Faiza-case", the case generated a considerable amount of media attention in Norway at the time. It was one of the first incidents of non-gang-related contract killings in modern Norwegian History.
Kidnapping.
In the early morning of Wednesday 3 February, the 26-year old Faiza Ashraf was waiting for the bus going from her home in Haslum to downtown Oslo, where she worked in a clothing boutique. While she was standing at the bus-stop at approx. 06:44, 25-year old Håvard Nyfløt pulled up, grabbed her and forced her into the trunk of his car. Ashraf managed to call the police from her cell-phone and inform them that she was being kidnapped, but she could not give her exact location. This event was witnessed by at least one passing motorist
After a short while, Nyfløt stopped the car and informed her that he was being paid by a third-person to have her taken and that he was to be paid NOK 100.000 for the crime. He also promised not to harm her, before continuing the drive. Ashraf then passed that information, along with a short description of her kidnapper, to the police, who were trying to trace the call. She also provided the police with the identity of Khan, whom she deduced had ordered her kidnapping. Khan had for the past five years been obsessed with marrying her, and according to Ashraf, harassed and tormented her during this period.
After driving to the forested area of Sollihøgda, approx 25 minutes outside of Oslo, Nyfløt opened his trunk and found Ashraf unresponsive, he then dragged her body to a pre prepared shallow grave about 200 meters from a popular ski-trail. Afterwards he vacuumed the trunk and carefully used a makeshift blowtorch to eliminate leftover evidence, before travelling to Sweden with his girlfriend.
Investigation.
On Wednesday 3 February Police announced a woman in her 20s from Asker had vanished. Police stated that they believed she was kidnapped. All traffic coming through Asker was stopped and checked by heavily armed police, That same afternoon, Police arrested 28-year old taxi-driver Shamrez Khan in Oslo. Ashraf had through her brief call to the police, named him as possible accomplice in her kidnapper. Khan had a long history of harassment and stalking Ashraf, and according to friends she felt threatened by him. He initially denied all culpability, and stated his desire to participate in finding her.
Large numbers of police and volunteer forces canvassed the Vestmarka woodlands adjacent to where her cell-phone was last used, but could not locate the missing 26-year old. Police also issued an international alert, in case she had been abducted and taken abroad.
On Wednesday 10 February, police arrested 25-year old Nyfløt, on suspicion of carrying out the kidnapping, he would later reveal under interrogation that Ashraf in fact was dead and gave the police the location of the body. Nyfløt stated that in order to pay off his gambling debts, he had kidnapped the woman on orders from Khan and that she had suffocated by accident while in the trunk. Khan denied ordering her murder and stated his intention was to have her kidnapped and tortured, not murdered. The motive for this was Ashraf's refusal to marry him. The two suspects had met while Nyfløt worked at a gas-station in Tveita where Khan was a regular customer.
Trial.
Nyfløt and Khan was on Thursday 14 May 2011 convicted respectively on the counts of second-degree murder and kidnapping of Faiza Ashraf. Neither of the two was convicted of premeditated murder. They were sentenced to 8 and 17 years in prison. However both sentences personally ordered appealed by attorney general Tor-Aksel Busch who felt strongly that the court had made the wrong decision, and during the second trial, both men were convicted of premeditated murder and kidnapping and had their sentences increased to 19 years for Khan and 18 years for Nyfløt. In addition, both men were to pay NOK 200.000 in compensation to Ashraf's parents.
On 28 March 2012 the Supreme Court of Norway declined to review both cases, effectively ending the appeals-process of both men.

NBA Baller Beats

NBA Baller Beats is a rhythm game developed by HB Studios and released by Majesco on the Xbox 360 for use with the Kinect motion sensing controller. Unlike most rhythm games that revolve around dancing or playing musical instruments, "NBA Baller Beats" instead has players dribbling a basketball to the rhythm of popular music. The game is officially licensed by the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is bundled with a replica Spalding basketball. Deron Williams is the cover athlete for the game.
The game has received positive reviews, with critics commenting that the game can improve basketball handling skills. However, concerns were raised with playing the game in a small room, as well as noise issues from both the game and the bouncing ball. Despite being well received, "NBA Baller Beats" did not sell well and was attributed to Majesco posting decreased earnings for 2012.
Gameplay.
In the game, various instructions to handle the basketball scroll down a lane on screen. Players are instructed to handle the ball various ways, including dribbling it in the left or right hand, passing it from one hand to another, dribbling between legs or faking a pass, all to the rhythm of the in-game music. The more accurate and timely the player's motions are, the more points are awarded. In this respect, the game has been considered as a possible way to teach basic basketball handling skills to novices. A tutorial mode called "Beat School" can assist players with the various moves.
Players can choose an NBA team and play in an environment adorned with that team's logo. Various unlockable content is also available, including in-game posters, trading cards and highlight videos for each team's players. Three different skill levels can be chosen - Rookie, Pro and Baller. Songs can be played in different venues, including a basketball court, beach and an amusement park. The in-game environments visually react to the beats of each song. In addition to the game's single player mode, there is also a versus mode in which players switch out at different points of the match.
Development and promotion.
The game was developed by the Halifax division of HB Studios, which closed after development on the game was completed. The developers wanted to use an actual basketball for gameplay and programmed the game to pick up the motion of a basketball along with the motion of players.
A playable demo was exhibited at E3 2012. In addition to having Deron Williams as the cover athlete, former NBA player Kenny Smith as well the WNBA's New York Liberty were tapped to market the game. Smith also provided narration for the in-game tutorial.
Soundtrack.
The game features a variety of popular music tracks:
Reception.
The game has received positive reviews, with some reviewers pointing out that the game could improve basketball handling skills. The New York Daily News said that the game "Actually can make you a better ball-handler", while Official Xbox Magazine said that players "definitely learn moves and increase your skills even if you never graduate past the Rookie difficulty level" and a reviewer for Game Zone wrote that the game "will undoubtedly help you with ball control." While the Daily News admitted that the game was playable in a living room even on a carpeted floor, all three reviews raised concerns about playing in a small space and possible noise issues with neighbors. Game Revolution echoed those concerns, while admitting that it does improve player's skills but also commenting that the game was not worth the full retail price. GameSpot also commented that the game might not be worth the price, citing the lack of content and the repetitive gameplay, writing "there's not enough variety to keep you invested in the long term." Nevertheless, they had a positive impression of the game as a teaching tool, calling the title a "refreshing if flawed take on the rhythm genre."
The game sold only 3,000 copies in its initial month of release. The title's lower than expected sales figures were cited as a cause of Majesco's decreased earnings for 2012.

Park of the Exposition

The Park of the Exposition is a park located in the Santa Beatriz neighborhood of downtown Lima, capital of Peru.
History.
The park was occupied by the south gate of the Walls of Lima, known as "Puerta de Guadalupe". In the 1870s President José Balta ordered the demolition of these walls within its modernization plan of the city. It was planned that this location would be aimed at building a park that would house the Lima International Exhibition of 1872. Thus, alongside the park, rose the Exhibition Palace (now the Museum of Art of Lima).
The park plan was made by Manuel Atanasio Fuentes and Italian architect Antonio Leonardi. Its design was neo-Renaissance and included the construction of pavilions including a zoo and other buildings. Leonardi also designed the Exhibition Palace. In the beginning the largest, covering the current and contemporary Park of the Reserve and the land where now stands the Estadio Nacional, were part of the park.
During the War of the Pacific, the park had a military use, before the invasion, as a garrison and a hospital and after the invasion as headquarters for the Chilean troops.
With the celebration of the centenary of the independence of Peru, Augusto B. Leguía was ordered to build several additional buildings, such as Byzantine Hall and the building that served as headquarters of the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is currently intended to be the Metropolitan Museum of Lima.
In 1961 he ordered the demolition of the Panopticon of Lima and the construction of the Civic Centre of Lima, the land north of Park of the Exposition and currently home to the Centre for Military and Historical Studies and the Museum of Italian Art that originally belonged the park, were considered part of the same.
During the 1970s, the Park of the Exposition fell into a severe decline. In the 1990s, during the administration of Alberto Andrade, the Park was restored and lakes and an amphitheater were created and the park opened to the park. Andrade renamed the park calling it Gran Parque de Lima but it later returned to its original name.

Baby on Board (Modern Family)

"Baby on Board" is the 24th episode of the third season of the American sitcom "Modern Family", and the series' 72nd episode overall. It aired on May 23, 2012. The episode was written by Abraham Higginbotham and directed by Steven Levitan.
Plot.
Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) are getting ready to attend Lily's (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) dance recital when they receive a phone call they waited for a long time. A mother from Mexico chose them to adopt her baby and she is giving birth at that moment. The two of them leave Lily with Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) to baby-sit her and take Gloria (Sofia Vergara) with them to serve as a translator. When they get to the hospital, a chain of events lead to them not getting the baby since the grandmother (Terri Hoyos) of the mother finds out about it and wants to raise it on her own. Mitch and Cameron have to deal with the disappointment once again.
Meanwhile, Jay and Manny have to baby-sit Lily and also take her to her dance recital. Getting there, Lily doesn't want to go on stage and perform because her daddies are not there. Jay talks to her trying to convince her to get on stage and she agrees she will do it only under one condition.
At the Dunphy's house, Alex (Ariel Winter) is getting ready to attend her first prom. Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) are excited for her, not only because she'll go to her prom, but also because she is going with her new boyfriend, Michael (Joe Metcalf). When they see Michael, all the excitement goes away because they can see that he is clearly gay, only that "he" doesn't know it yet.
Haley (Sarah Hyland) on the other hand doesn't want to go her prom, something that surprises Phil and Claire. Instead she says that she'll get a gap year between school and college and she'll get a job. The real reason she is acting like this is because she wants to make an announcement about her plans on moving in with Dylan (Reid Ewing). That's something Claire and Phil don't like and they try to convince her that it's not a good idea. The solution comes from Luke (Nolan Gould) who's been hiding some of the family's mail including the letter of Haley's acceptance at the college.
The episode ends with a cliffhanger from Gloria when she says that she was not car sick on her way to Mexico but that she was pregnant.
Reception.
Ratings.
In its original American broadcast, "Baby on board" was watched by 10.07 million; up 0.71 million from the previous episode.
Reviews.
The final episode of season 3 received critical acclaim, with some critics labelling it as one of the greatest episodes of the show thus far. Many critics laid praise on the emotional depth of Mitchell and Cameron's story, the well crafted humour and the use of a cliffhanger ending. This finale was also very well received by fans, with the episode gaining a score of 8.7 on IMDb; the highest of the season. 
Donna Bowman of "The A.V. Club" gave a B+ grade. For the way the writers closed the show she stated: "...I don’t mind the cliffhanger at all. Not only is this a genuinely new dynamic for the show to explore [...] but it’s also presented in the context of the repetition of childhood through each succeeding stage in life.".
Leigh Raines of "TV Fanatic" gave a 5/5 grade saying that "Baby On Board" might have been her favorite episode of all-time. "For an Emmy-winning show that had a pretty mediocre season, I'm totally shocked to say that I think "Baby on Board" might've been my favorite Modern Family episode of all-time. It had it all. The true mark of a perfect sitcom is a show that can take you from laughing to crying in a matter of seconds - and this episode served up plenty of that. And all with a super surprising ending!"
Christine N. Ziemba of "Paste Magazine" rated the episode with a 9/10, closing her review with: "We liked the fact that the Modern Family writers didn’t spoonfeed us happy endings. We were in stitches one moment with Cam and Mitchell in the hospital, watching the soap opera unfold, and in the next we were feeling their loss. We laughed and we cried in a 30-minute period. And that’s what good TV is all about."
Kristen Dyrr from "Yahoo TV" writes: "The "Modern Family" Season 3 finale episode "Baby on Board" is one of the best episodes of the show. The episode has it all. There are sad moments, happy moments, and twists and turns. Some of the laughs are hilarious and sad at the same time, others are both funny and creepy, and still others are cute and adorable. Every character is featured equally, so all preferences are covered. There is something for everyone."
Also, the storyline with the failed adoption of a second baby by Mitch and Cameron and the way the two actors played the scene of frustration and disappointment received positive feedback. "...Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet got to play maybe the strongest emotional material they've had in the show's run to date, and that made the episode a lot richer than we would have guessed [...] the reaction these two men had to the disappointment felt entirely earned. The scene was also maybe the purest expression of love Mitchell and Cam have ever shown one another - for all their Bickersons routine, this is an unquestionably committed couple, and it's nice to be shown that once in a while."
Accolades.
Steven Levitan received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for this episode.

Transfiguration of our Lord Russian Orthodox Church

Transfiguration of our Lord Russian Orthodox Church is a Russian Orthodox church is located in Baltimore, Maryland. The church belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.
History.
The parish church was founded in 1963 by Vladimir and Anastasia Norko, an immigrant couple, in order to serve the needs of the Russian American immigrant community in Baltimore. Rev. Nikolai Makowelski was the first reverend of the church and served until his retirement in 1984. 
The church was served for 12 years by visiting priests from Washington, D.C. For many years the church was in decline, until 1997 when the Reverend Metropolitan Vitaly made the decision to hold services in Old Church Slavonic, and appointed a new rector, Rev. Rostislav Sheniloff to restore the church and parish life. The Rev. Sheniloff faithfully served in the church until his untimely death in 2002, after having succeeded in giving the church a new lease on life. All other churches in Baltimore use English during their services. The use of Old Church Slavonic was meant to appeal to Russian and other Slavic immigrants to Baltimore. 
In 2004, the church acquired a new rector, Rev. Ion Barbus, who is still actively serving in the parish. 
The iconostasis of the church was painted by the Orthodox priest and artist Theodore Jurewicz, one of the foremost disciples of the renowned Russian Orthodox iconographer abroad, Fr. Cyprian of the Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York.

Medal summary.
Several age records in alpine skiing were set at these Olympic Games:
Qualification.
A maximum of 320 (later adjusted to 350 by the International Ski Federation) quota spots were available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of 22 athletes could be entered by a National Olympic Committee, with a maximum of 14 men or 14 women. There were two qualification standards for the games: an A standard and a B standard.
Participating nations.
327 athletes from 74 nations were scheduled to participate, with number of athletes in parentheses. Only 319 athletes competed in actual competition as the other 8 athletes suffered injuries during training. Four nations qualified for the Winter Olympics for the first time, and hence competed in alpine skiing for the first time as well: Malta, Timor-Leste, Togo and Zimbabwe. Moreover, both Venezuela and Thailand made their Olympic debuts in the sport. One of Thailand's skiers was world renown concert violinist "Vanessa-Mae" Vanakorn. India's athletes initially competed as Independent Olympic Participants, as the Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the International Olympic Committee, but the suspension had since been lifted.

List of lighthouses in Massachusetts

This is a list of all lighthouses in the U.S. state of Massachusetts as identified by the United States Coast Guard. Enumeration of the lighthouses in this state is complicated by the number of multiple tower stations and replacement of older towers, with the Brant Point Light station having had nine towers, two of which survive. At present there are forty-seven active towers, of which eleven are privately maintained; thirteen are standing but inactive, seven have been replaced with skeleton towers, thirteen have been destroyed or removed, and one tower has been moved to another state. The oldest station, Boston Light, established in 1716, was the first lighthouse built in the colonies, and the current tower at that station, built in 1783, is the oldest survivor in the state and the second oldest in the nation, and was the last lighthouse automated in the United States. The last station established was at the Buzzards Bay Entrance Light in 1961 (since replaced by an automated light on a steel tripod), but in 1986 the 1818 Great Point Light was rebuilt and relit, making it the last tower constructed in the state. The tallest towers in the state are the two Cape Ann Light towers, but the highest focal plane is at the Hospital Point Range Rear Light, which is located in the steeple of the First Baptist Church of Beverly.
A number of inactivated Massachusetts lights have met with unusual fates. The Three Sisters of Nauset were sold off to separate private buyers before being purchased by the National Park Service and moved back near their original site. Range lights in Nantucket and Hyannis were incorporated into private dwellings, the former housing the Gilbreth family of "Cheaper by the Dozen" fame. The Point Gammon Light was converted into an observation tower for birdwatching.
If not otherwise noted, focal height and coordinates are taken from the United States Coast Guard "Light List", while location and dates of activation, automation, and deactivation are taken from the United States Coast Guard Historical information site for lighthouses.

Versatilism is an artistic movement proposed in 2007 by Brazilian artist Denis Mandarino, from a literary manifesto, with the intention of freeing people from the expert analysis and promote the practice of art as a form of self-knowledge and spiritual enhancement. In the body of text are present the following aesthetic principles and propositions:
""New ideas are hard to identify, hard to assimilate, and only detachment may be able to evaluate them in a more open way. When a man assumes the role of giving the verdict about what artists are doing, or the society gives him this role, we are one step closer to repeat the greatest injustices that men of science, philosophy, arts and religion have suffered throughout history." -- Interview about the Versatilist Manifesto"

Human rights in the Maldives

Human rights in the Maldives, an archipelagic nation of 328,536 people off the coast of the Indian Subcontinent, is a contentious issue. In its 2011 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House declared the Maldives "Partly Free", claiming a reform process which had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled. The United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption, lack of religious freedom, and abuse and unequal treatment of women.
History and political situation.
The Maldives gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1965. The nation began its independent existence as a sultanate, but a 1968 referendum approved a constitution establishing the nation as a republic. Ibrahim Nasir, Prime Minister under the sultanate, became President and held office from 1968 to 1978. He was succeeded by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who was elected President in 1978 and re-elected in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998, and 2003. At the end of his presidency in 2008, he was the longest serving leader in Asia. The national government generally exercised tight control over its people durign this time.
The following chart shows the Maldives' ratings since 1972 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House. A rating of 1 is "free"; 7, "not free".
After a coup attempt by supporters of Nasir was uncovered in 1980, the government arrested those thought to be involved, and their wives and children were placed under house arrest. At least three people were sentenced for association with the former president, and at least one – Mohamed Ismail Manniku Sikku, the former Director of Civil Aviation – was banished to an uninhabited atoll for "ten years and a day".
The president considered responsible for the human rights gains in 2009–2010, Mohamed Nasheed, resigned after weeks of protests led by police and was placed under house arrest. He was replaced by Mohammed Waheed Hassan, the former head of UNICEF Afghanistan.
Current issues (2008–).
Freedom of religion.
The constitution states that all Maldivians must be Sunni Muslim. On 14 December 2011 a group of ten men attacked peaceful demonstrators in Malé calling for religious tolerance. Sufi Ismail Khilath Rasheed sustained a skull fracture and was later arrested as his calls for tolerance were unconstitutional. No effort was made to arrest the attackers. On 5 June 2012, Rasheed was stabbed in the neck. Reporters Without Borders stated that it appeared that he had been deliberately targeted for his journalism. A minister of the Maldivian government condemned the attack, but also added "Hilath must have known that he had become a target of a few extremists ... We are not a secular country. When you talk about religion there will always be a few people who do not agree."
The Ministry of Islamic Affairs is the only body which grants licenses to imams, and sermons must be approved. They also control religious education and have the power to deport any non-Muslim. Non-Muslim foreigners must practice their religion in private.
Freedom of speech.
Speech "contrary to the tenets of Islam" is illegal, but defamation was made legal in 2009.
Media and censorship.
2008 saw the Maldives' first private television channels. In August 2010 private channel Villa TV was attacked, and journalists were attacked by police for covering a political protest in October 2010. Opposition websites can be accessed in the country, but some Christian missionary websites have been blocked by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.
On 1 May 2011 two journalists – one from "Haveeru Daily" and one from "Sun FM" – were arrested for covering a protest. They were released after 24 hours.
Freedom of assembly.
The constitution protects "freedom of peaceful assembly without prior permission of the State", and the US State Department claims these rights are generally upheld.
Legal system.
The Maldives practices Sharia Law. Most judges have no formal legal training and are given much leeway in their interpretations of Muslim law. The nation lacks a penal code.
The Maldives National Defence Force holds human rights courses.
Allegations of arbitrary arrests and torture.
Flogging is a frequently imposed punishment, and carried out behind the court buildings. 96 people – over 80% of them women – were sentenced to this mode of punishment in 2010.
Arbitrary arrest and detention is illegal.
At least four members of parliament were arrested in July 2010. They claimed the detentions were carried out to force them to comply with political demands. They were released soon after. On 16 August 2011 one of these MPs, Abdullah Yameen, was granted compensation.
Minority and women's rights.
Parliament contains five female members, and women have a 98% literacy rate.
Flogging is a punishment imposed upon women for extramarital sex. On 5 July 2009 an eighteen-year-old woman was sentenced to 100 lashings for sex with two men outside marriage; her pregnancy was used by the courts as proof of guilt. The two men were acquitted. Journalists reported that she fainted after the punishment was carried out and taken to a local hospital. 
In 2011 four police officers were discharged from the force, but not formally charged, for driving a woman around Malé, forcing her to strip her clothes, sexually and physically abusing her, and throwing her on the street.
As the state practices Sharia law, homosexuality is illegal. The punishment for men is nine months to one year imprisonment, or 10 to 30 lashes. The punishment for women is nine months to one year of house arrest.
In February 2013, the judiciary sentenced a fifteen-year-old girl to 100 lashes and house arrest for 8 months in Vilimale's orphanage for engaging in premarital sex. The international media caught the story when her fornication case came alongside her rape case. Charges were brought against her in 2012 after police investigated accusations that her stepfather had raped her and killed their baby. He is still to face trial. Prosecutors stated her conviction did not relate to the rape case; she was sentenced for fornication, "which is a different matter."

Windsor Yacht Club

The Windsor Yacht Club (WYC) is a private yacht club in Windsor, Ontario. It is located on the Canadian mainland just south of Peche Island overlooking the Detroit River. The clubhouse overlooks the southern shore of Peche Island and is at the north-end of the Detroit River, which takes water from Lake St. Clair.
WYC is a member of the Detroit Regional Yacht-racing Association (DRYA) and the Inter-Lake Yachting Association (I-LYA).
History.
In 1936 a group of boat owners who occupied the marina that would soon become the Windsor Yacht Club decided to form an organization of boaters. A modest clubhouse was built where the present clubhouse stands. Over the winter of 1936 and 1937 meetings were held which led to the formation of the yacht club in 1937. The first major expansion occurred after World War II when in 1945 the Clubhouse was expanded for the addition of kitchen and dining facilities. The Club grew substantially in the 1960s with both more wells being constructed and the clubhouse being expanded and improved upon. The clubhouse would later be reconstructed in 2001, as it stands today. The Windsor Yacht Club celebrated its 75th anniversary in the year 2012. 
The Windsor Yacht Club still holds many of its traditions including:
Gentlemen do not wear hats in the Club House. When or if this occurs, the bartender rings a bell and the "offender" is obliged to treat those in attendance on the occasion. Exception to this rule may be made on medical or religious grounds. 
The parking spot on the east side of the parking lot closest to the Club House door is reserved for the Commodore. 
Behind the bar, there are four vertical lights denoting the various flag officers of the Club. The lights are illuminated when any of the above are in attendance at the Club. Similarly if any of the above are in the dining room, a small flag is placed on their table signifying their flag positions.
There are several official functions held throughout the year at the Club:
Resurrection Day ▪ Blessing of the Fleet ▪ Commodore's Ball
Directors.
The Windsor Yacht Club has numerable directors who are in charge of the function of the Club:
Marina.
Windsor Yacht Club has two harbours, one east of the clubhouse and one to the west. The Windsor Yacht Club has 62 slips (allowing vessels up to 60 feet in length). WYC extends its facilities (dining room, bar, swimming pool, harbour amenities) to members of reciprocal clubs, including members of (DRYA) and (I-LYA) affiliated clubs.
Racing.
Windsor Yacht Club is active in the sport of yacht racing and is a member of the Detroit Regional Yacht-racing Association (DRYA) along with 26 other clubs in the region. Windsor Yacht Club hosts races in Lake St. Clair. The club hosts a Spring series and a Fall series consisting of 7 races each. One-design classes that race include the J/120 and C&C 35, open classes include PHRF A, PHRF B, and JAM. WYC also hosts other races notable in the area, including the Chimo Race and the Canadian Club Regatta.

<doc id="36828905" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36828905" title="Thapsia villosa">
Thapsia villosa

Thapsia villosa, commonly known as the villous deadly carrot, is a species of poisonous herbaceous plants in the genus "Thapsia". It grows to about in height. It has pinnate hairy leaves with sheath-like petioles. The flowers are yellow in color and borne on compound umbels. They develop into fruits with four wings characteristic of the genus. It is native to southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The plant was used extensively for traditional medicine since around the 3rd century BC.
Taxonomy.
"Thapsia villosa" was first described by Carl Linnaeus in "Species Plantarum" (1753). It is classified under the genus "Thapsia", subfamily Apioideae, of the carrot and parsley family Apiaceae. Two varieties are recognized: "T. villosa" var. "villosa" and "T. villosa" var. "dissecta".
The generic name "Thapsia" is derived from the Ancient Greek name θαψία ("thapsía") for the members of the genus. The Greeks believe it to have originated from ancient Thapsos in Sicily. The specific epithet is from Latin "villōsus" ("hairy" or "shaggy").
It is commonly known in English as the 'villous deadly carrot' or simply 'deadly carrot'. It is known under a large number of common names in other languages, including "bu-nefar" in Arabic; "zumillo" and "cañaheja" in Spanish; "baladra" in Catalan; "croca" in Majorcan; "turbit-da-terra" in Portuguese; "bermidor" in Basque; "turbith bâtard" in French; and "turbito falso" in Italian.
Description.
"Thapsia villosa" is a perennial herb growing to a height of . It has a robust and smooth tapering stem about in diameter, arising from a thick root resembling a white carrot or turnip.
The leaves, like the name of the species suggests, are hairy. The leaves around the base of the stem have well-developed sheath-like petioles about wide. Like the leaves, they are also hairy. They are whitish, yellowish, green, or (rarely) purple in color. The leaf blades are triangular to deltoid in shape and are pinnate, subdivided once to thrice. The last leaflet subdivision is usually about wide in "T. villosa" var. "villosa"; while they are only about wide in "T. villosa" var. "dissecta". The margins of the leaves are curled (revolute) with small teeth-like and triangular serrated edges, each tipped with small spike. The main leaf midrib (rachis) is densely covered in hair and light to dark green on the upper side, while it is smooth and grayish to greenish on the underside. The leaves are largest at the bottom and progressively become smaller the higher they are on the stem. In the upper parts of the stem, the leaves are often reduced to nothing more than petioles which form sheaths around the stem.
Like other members of the genus, the inflorescence of "Thapsia villosa" is a compound subhemispherical to globose umbel. It has 9 to 29 spokes and is about in diameter. Bracts are usually absent, though in rare cases, one to three may be present, each around in length and lanceolate in shape. The umbellules are hemispherical to globose. Bracteoles are also usually absent, though rarely 1 or 2 may be present. Each umbellule has about 18 to 43 flowers, each with five bright yellow elliptical petals. The fruits are oblong and around long and wide. When mature, they are light to dark brown in color with four yellowish to brownish wings characteristic of the genus. The main umbel has hermaphroditic flowers, containing both stamen and pistil. Smaller umbels may develop from the sides of the stem which usually contains only stamens. These umbels wither away quickly.
"Thapsia villosa" is highly variable in morphology. The two varieties, "T. villosa" var. "dissecta" and "T. villosa" var. "villosa" are usually distinguished by how many times the leaf subdivides into leaflets. "T. villosa" var. "dissecta" has leaves that are deeply subdivided two or three times into narrow and small leaflets. "T. villosa" var. "villosa", in contrast are usually subdivided only once or twice. However, there are numerous intermediate forms between the two varieties and distinguishing between them can be very difficult. The diploid chromosome number (2n) of "Thapsia villosa" is 22, 33, 44, or 66.
Ecology.
Unlike most members of the family Apiaceae, "Thapsia villosa" flowers early, during the months of May, June, and July. The flowers are pollinated by a variety of insects. The flowers develop into winged fruits that dry out around August, while other members of the family are usually still in bloom.
Distribution and habitat.
The native range of "Thapsia villosa" extends from southern France and the Iberian peninsula (Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar) to northwestern Africa (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia). It has also been introduced into Corsica. They can be found growing at altitudes of above sea level in scrublands, clearings, and near recently disturbed land like roads or cultivated fields.
In its native range, it is frequently confused with the similar-looking "Ferula communis", the giant fennel. "Thapsia villosa" and "Ferula communis" share some common names in Spanish like "cañaheja". Reports of "Thapsia villosa" in the Balearic Isles is likely the result of confusion with "Thapsia gymnesica".
Toxicity.
"Thapsia villosa" is highly poisonous. Skin contact with the roots can cause severe itching and swelling.
Uses.
Traditional medicine.
The medicinal properties of the members of the genus "Thapsia" has been recognized as early 300 BC. In traditional medicine, the roots of "Thapsia villosa" were used as a purgative and emetic. Resin from the "Thapsia villosa" was used as a blister-producing agent (vesicant) or a counterirritant, similar to resin derived from "Thapsia garganica". In Spain, the resin is also traditionally used in Segarra as treatment for scabies. Poultices made from root bark infused with oil was used as a pain-reliever and for treating rheumatism. These were also used in Salamanca for treating cracks in horse hooves.
Traditional medicinal uses of the plant, however, are now considered largely ineffective and highly inadvisable due to the danger posed by the poisons of "Thapsia villosa".
Medical research.
Along with "Thapsia garganica" and "Thapsia transtagana", "Thapsia villosa" var. "villosa" contains C-19 terpenolides with strong SERCA-inhibiting properties "in vitro". They are of interest to medical researchers for their potential in treating neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.
Other uses.
Poison from the roots of "Thapsia villosa" is traditionally used by fishermen in Catalonia as an ichthyotoxin for stunning fish, making them easier to catch. Extracts from the root bark of "Thapsia villosa" have been used since ancient times as a yellow dye. In the 18th century, yellow dye from the flowers were used to color wool. "Thapsia villosa" are also grown as ornamentals for their bright yellow flowers.

Robert Lynen

Robert Lynen (24 May 1920 – 1 April 1944) was a French actor. A child star of French cinema, he joined the French Resistance during his country's occupation during World War II, was arrested and deported to Germany before been shot by a firing squad after repeated escape attempts.
Acting career.
Lynen was born on 24 May 1920 in Nermier and spent the first years of his life in his native Jura, where his parents raised animals. In 1923, his family moved to Paris where his father became a draftsman. Being from an artistic family (his mother was a singer and pianist), he was noticed at age 12 by filmmaker Julien Duvivier while he was studying at the École du Spectacle. After some tests, he was hired for the lead role of "Poil de carotte" (1932) with Harry Baur.
Following the film's public success, Lynen became the child star of French cinema. He was to be featured in four more movies: "The Little King" (1933); "La belle équipe" (1936); "L'Homme du jour" (1936) and "Un carnet de bal" (1937). Then he was Rémi in the 1934 film adaptation of Hector Malot's novel, "Sans Famille". In 1937, he acted in Robert Siodmak's movie "Mollenard", then in "Le Fraudeur" by Léopold Simons. At age 18, he played Alphonse Daudet's "Le Petit Chose" for Maurice Cloche, then "La vie est magnifique" with the same filmmaker.
World War II.
In 1940, he acted, at age 20, in "Espoirs" by Willy Rozier, before being sent to a Vichy-sponsored youth camp, where he joined the French Resistance, becoming a second lieutenant in the French Forces network "Alliance". In 1941, he went on a theater tour and acted in his last film "Cap au large" by Jean-Paul Paulin. He performed many missions before being arrested by the Gestapo in Cassis, on 7 February 1943. He was tortured and deported to Germany. After several months in prison and two escape attempts, he was sentenced to death by a military tribunal and executed, with 14 other Resistance members, on 1 April 1944 in the fortress of Karlsruhe, at the age of 23. When his body, which had been buried in a common grave, was repatriated to France in 1947, it was reburied in the military section of the Gentilly cemetery.

Legends of the Three Kingdoms

Legends of the Three Kingdoms (Simplified Chinese: 三国杀, literally Three Kingdoms Kill), or sometimes Sanguosha, LTK, 3KK for short, is a Chinese card game based on the Three Kingdoms period of China and the semi-fictional novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (ROTK). The rules of LTK are similar to the rules of the Italian card game Bang!. LTK is released by YOKA games (游卡桌游) on January 1, 2008, and till date has spun-off a total of seven official expansion sets, an online version LTK Online, as well as a children's version LTK Q Version. There are self-created cards by players, but these are mostly unofficial.
LTK initially began with a strong following in China only because the entire game is in Chinese. Sales of LTK totaled 20 million yuan in 2009, and 100 million yuan in 2010. However the game has begun to reach an international audience after players began translating the game into the English language and posting these translations on blogs and forums. Site visit statistics from one of these blogs showed that readers outside of China come primarily from Singapore, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, and New Zealand.
Relevance to History.
The cards and characters of LTK are all related to the ancient history of China, the most telling of which are the characters and their abilities. Each character is given an ability in the game which usually mirrors the historical character's personality, actions, strength/weakness, cause of death, and historical events in which the character was involved, etc. For example, Liu Bei's ability Kindness(仁德) allows him to give away his cards to other players, mirroring the benevolent and kind nature of Liu Bei in ROTK. Cao Cao, on the other hand, is given the ability Treachery(奸雄), which allows him to keep any card which causes him damage. This mirrors Cao Cao's style of coaxing able advisers of his enemies to defect and join him, then utilizing them for his cause.
The relevance of these abilities to ROTK and the Three Kingdoms history is interesting enough to inspire players to discover more about ROTK and Three Kingdoms history for themselves. One blog author describes his knowledge of Three Kingdoms evolving from uninterested to semi-expert after immersing in the study of LTK abilities. In August 2012, UC Berkeley offered a course in LTK. The faculty sponsor of the course, Professor Robert Berring, wants to get undergrads "acquainted with essential philosophy dating back to China's ancient dynasties".
Basic Rules of the Standard Mode.
The standard mode of LTK can be played by 2 to 10 people. Each player plays one of these four roles: Monarch (主公), Minister (忠臣), Rebel (反贼) and Traitors(内奸). There can be only one monarch in the game at all times, but the number of ministers, rebels and traitors are determined by the total number of players, as shown in the table on the right. Each player may have 3 or 4 Health points (see below), depending on their character.
Objectives.
Different roles have different victory conditions:
The game ends immediately if:
As long as one of the scenarios listed above occur at the endgame, the associated roles can claim victory even if the character has already been killed. In general, the Monarch and his ministers must work together to kill the rebels and turn-coats, while the rebels can cooperate to kill off the ministers before attacking the Monarch. Meanwhile, the turn-coat(s) can guise as a minister and help to kill the rebels, before revolting against the ministers and finally confronting the Monarch.
Types of Cards.
LTK consists of a few types of cards, which serve different purposes in the game.
Play.
There are six main phases to playing when it comes to any player's turn.
Death.
When a player's Health points is reduced to 0, he faces imminent death and must instantly take action: he may request to be saved by a "Peach" card (thus letting other players play the card), or may use one immediately if he has it. If he is successful, his health will be recovered to 1 point. Otherwise, he dies(except some special character like Zhou Tai), and must reveal his role card and discard all other cards. If he is a Rebel and killed by a card from another player, that player may draw 3 cards.
It is possible for a player's health to have a negative value (such as suffering from a Lightning attack). In this case, the player will need as many "Peach" cards as he requires to raise his health back to 1 point in order to continue the game (for example, a Health point of -1 requires 2 "Peach" cards). The abilities of certain cards or characters may involve healing more than 1 points of health, or even prolonged living below 1 Health point.
Point duels.
Certain special characters (such as Xun Yu) may initiate point duals to unleash their special abilities. This is done when the initiator plays a card, and asks another player to do the same.
"Ace" is the smallest value and "King" is the largest value. This is where it is slightly different from Poker numbering. The numerical digit on the upper left corner of the playing card. The player with the larger point value wins. In the case of ties, the initiator of the duel is considered to have "lost" the duel. Suits such as diamonds, hearts, etc. do not matter. Both cards are discarded into the discard deck; players cannot retrieve back the cards into their hands.
Character allegiance.
All LTK characters are separated into four historically relevant allegiances. They are Shu Kingdom, Wei Kingdom, Wu Kingdom, and Neutral Heroes. In the original LTK, there are no repeated characters. However as later character expansions are introduced, some characters are duplicated in different allegiances. This is because of the complex changes of each historical figure. Some characters, such as Jia Xu, were under the allegiance of different kingdoms through the course of their lives.
With the introduction of the first LTK expansion pack, a new fictional allegiance known as the Demi-Gods was introduced. Demi-God characters are typically very significant characters in ROTK and Three Kingdoms history, and these characters are given abilities that are much more powerful than regular characters. The presence of Demi-God characters can severely imbalance a regular game, and thus most players choose not to include Demi-God characters into gameplay. Since Demi-God characters are obtained by chance in expansion packs, Demi-God character cards have become collectible pieces. Prices of single Demi-God cards have been known to equal, or exceed, the price of the whole expansion pack.
In 2011, YOKA released collectible SP cards that comes with every purchase of Zhuo You Zhi 桌游志 magazine, a monthly magazine discussing board and card-games in China. Many SP cards are remakes of existing LTK characters with different allegiances, representing that character from a different time period in his or her career.
Expansion packs and collectibles.
As of October 2012, seven different official LTK expansion packs have been released. Two different Collector's Editions have also been released. Beginning January 2011, ultra-collectible SP cards were released monthly with every purchase of Zhuoyouzhi 桌游志 magazine. As of October 2012, the SP Yang Xiu character released with the inaugural issue of Zhuoyouzhi magazine has been seen to sell for 500 yuan, which is over forty times the original price of the magazine.
Variations.
Variations to the original game are played by people from all over China. The game has since been translated into English. Many people created different ways of playing LTK with no roles.
Criticisms.
LTK is still being regarded as a copy-cat of Bang! in English-speaking countries, due to the similarities between the basic cards and tool cards. However, LTK has managed to entrench its position through the game's strong relations to ROTK.
Poor build quality of the Collector's Editions product is also a regular criticism, where the plastic tray holding the cards regular come crushed and the matt finishing of the box is prone to scratches. One online shop selling LTK was known to discourage customers from purchasing Collector's Edition altogether to avoid product exchanges and refunds.

Dirty Drivin'

Dirty Drivin' is an arcade racing game developed by Specular Interactive and released by Raw Thrills in 2011. The game was also released in the People's Republic of China, which was unveiled at the GTI Asia China Expo. The game's main track played throughout the menu is "More Human than Human" by White Zombie.
Gameplay.
In "Dirty Drivin"', players engage in vehicular combat, and gear-shaped power-ups are available throughout the track, which can be used to destroy enemy vehicles by pulling a skull-shaped crank, which do not return to the race after getting destroyed; exceptions to this are the player and their rival, a single AI opponent, as well as other players when playing in multiplayer. Players can also jerk the wheel to hit opponents, and whenever an opponent gets destroyed, a photo of the opponent appears at the bottom of the screen, as well as a taunt. Points that the player earns increases the amount of weapons available to the player on the "Jerk-O-Meter". Also scattered throughout the track are crates, which can increase the player's points, double dirty on the power-ups, or give the player a free race.
After every race, a slot machine-style game is played called "Yank the Crank", where the player is to pull the skull crank, in an attempt to earn items that can be used in the next race (but will be lost if the player leaves the game), as well as a free race, though players can also get a "You Lose", which not only leaves them empty handed, but also logs them out of the game.
The game has a password system, where players enter a PIN to save their progress.
Cars.
There are 11 cars in this game. Each car has its own special ability and powers and can be upgraded at the "Gearbox".
Tracks.
There are 7 different environments in the game. There are also flipped versions of the 7 tracks, making a total of 14 courses in the game.
Development.
Development for "Dirty Drivin"' started in 2009, and was originally designed by Specular Interactive as ""H2Overdrive" on wheels", and the prototype cabinet for the game was a modified "H2Overdrive" unit with pedals and a slot machine crank. On the cabinet, gauges depict the situation that the player is in (though the developers originally intended to use automobile gauges).

Brunyarra

Brunyarra, now known as Del Monte, is a historic house in the Sydney suburb of Strathfield. The house is now located within the grounds of Santa Maria Del Monte, the junior campus of Santa Sabina College, and is situated on the corner of The Boulevarde and Carrington Avenue, Strathfield. It is a heritage listed item on Municipality of Strathfield's Local Environmental Plan.
History.
Built in 1886, Brunyarra was the home of John Spencer Brunton (1861–1937), a member of an Australian flour milling family. The house name is believed to be the first sylable of the family name Brunton and Yarra from the Yarra River in Melbourne where Brunton was educated. Brunton sold the house in 1908 and moved to Gladswood House. The next owner was Edward Scholes (1858-1933), a Judge of the District Court and Industrial Court, who purchased Brunyarra for £3,900. Between 1918 and 1928, Brunyarra was owned by Albert Grace of Grace Bros. Ownership then passed to Mrs Mary Bailey who changed the name of the house to Del Monte and ran it as a function and wedding reception centre. On her death in 1950, Bailey beqeathed the property to the Dominican Sisters of Santa Sabina, who the following year opened a new junior school in the house.
Architecture.
Brunyarra is representative of the substantial homes built in Strathfield during the later half of the 19th century. It was built in the Victorian Italianate style with a solid and sedate façade. The street front has wide verandahs and balconies to the south-eastern corner decorated with moulded balustrades, columns and bases and ornate capitals. Arched windows in recessed surrounds and a six-panel entrance door flanked by sidelights and topped by a fanlight add to the detailing of the verandahsIt and balconies. The low pitched roof, originally in slate, is now finished in Concrete tiles. Additions, including an annex to the northern side, the enclosure of the side balcony and buildings to the rear, have been made since the 1950s.

Roccamonfina (volcano)

The Volcano of Roccamonfina is an extinct volcano in Roccamonfina, Campania, southern Italy. It was active from some 650,000 to 50,000 years ago. It comprises an isolated large cone of some perimeter between the Monti Aurunci, the plain and valley of the Garigliano, the Monte Massico and the Monti Trebulani. The central caldera has a diameter of nearly . Volcanic activity is now replaced by minor seismic movements and by the presence of mineral waters. The mount is part of the Roccamonfina-Garigliano Mouth Regional Park, created in 1999.
Geology.
The volcano originated as a stratovolcano in the Garigliano rift valley, with a group of eructive mouths spread in a area; later an effusive activity concentrated in the central area, forming a volcanic cone some 1,800 m-high, mostly formed of tephra and accompanied by minor cones such as the Monte Ofelio at south-west. Some 400,000 years ago, the collapse of the volcano's eastern sector formed a caldera which, for some time, was occupied by a volcanic lake. 
A second period of volcanic activity began some 385,000 years ago with an explosive eruption, including eruptions from the former caldera. This phase continued until some 285,000 years ago. The formation of the volcano also modified the course of the Garigliano and Volturno rivers. The latter moved southwest in what is its current course; the Garigliano no longer reached the sea, and formed a lake (Lake Lirino) until (around 200,000 years ago) it eroded rocks near Suio and assumed the current course.

St. Andrew's Anglican Church, Toogoolawah

St. Andrew’s Anglican Church, Mangerton Street, Toogoolawah, Queensland, Australia, was designed by diocesan architect Robin Dods and built entirely of wood by local builder D.A. Menzies at a cost of £839 in 1912. It featured a shingle roof, a hand carved altar and a choir stall screen and was described at the time as “a welcome advance in the church architecture of this district”. The Anglican Church Chronicle reported that “The treatment is original and effective and proves that the possibilities in connection with the architecture of wooden buildings are wider in extent than is commonly supposed.” In the details of its listing on the Queensland Heritage Register eighty year later, it was described as “an excellent example of the ecclesiastical work of Brisbane architect Robin Smith Dods.”
St. Andrew’s was dedicated by Archbishop St Clair Donaldson (Archbishop of Brisbane) on 12 May 1912.
This church was built on land given by the family of J.H. McConnel, who were personal friends of Archbishop Donaldson, and the original building had no buttresses. In February 1913 it was reported that, “St Andrew's Anglican Church was severely strained and put out of plumb by a very severe windstorm last week-end. The roof and superstructure only appear to have suffered.” Garden fetes raised money and tenders for repairs were called in April 1913. By August it was reported that these repairs included buttressing the church, and these buttresses have been a feature of this church since that time.
In 1925 a Rectory for St. Andrew’s was built for £1008 by a local contractor and it was formally opened and blessed by Bishop Le Fanu on 10 July 1925. Like the Church and the Church Hall it was entered on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992. It is described there as a good example of an intact 1920s weatherboard Queensland house and has been the home of the rector of the Toogoolawah, and later the amalgamated Brisbane Valley, Parish since it was built. 
The original stables beside the church were removed in 1978 to relocate the Anglican Church Hall there and this building was also entered on the Qld. Heritage Register
The Church received the baptismal font from Archbishop Donaldson’s private chapel at Bishopsbourne as a gift before its dedication, and now has many stained glass windows. St. Andrew’s Anglican Church, Toogoolawah, celebrated a hundred years of service on 12 May 2012 where the Rob Nolan, Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Brisbane and Bishop of the Western Region, conducted the centenary service.

Kim Ji-seok

Kim Ji-seok (born Kim Bo-seok on April 21, 1981) is a South Korean actor.
Career.
Kim Bo-seok debuted in 2001 as a rapper in the five-member Eurodance boyband LEO (리오), formed to capitalize on the success of then-popular boyband g.o.d.. But LEO never hit it big, and the group disbanded after eight months.
After failing the exam to get into the theater department, Kim majored in German at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. Having attended middle school and high school in England, Kim is also fluent in English and he received his secondary teaching certificate in German and English in 2006. He also has a master's degree in Cultural Contents Planning from Kyung Hee University's Graduate School of Journalism and Communication.
Told by the head of his agency that his birth name could be confused with veteran actors Jung Bo-seok and Kim Bo-seong, he was given the stage name "Kim Ji-seok." Kim began his acting career by appearing in the 2004 music video of Kim Hyung-joong's "She's Laughing", followed by several minor roles. Though his daily drama "Likeable or Not" recorded high ratings of over 40% in 2007-2008, Kim still did not become a household name. Then a year later, Kim played a member of the Korean national ski jumping team in "Take Off", which became the second-highest grossing Korean film in 2009. His popularity increased even more when he played an immature, womanizing slave hunter ("chuno") in period drama "The Slave Hunters", the lover of a transgendered man in comedy "Lady Daddy", and a competitive ex-boyfriend in "Personal Taste".
He enlisted for his mandatory military service on May 24, 2010 at the Nonsan training center in South Chungcheong Province for five weeks of basic training. After serving active duty with the Defense Media Agency of the Ministry of National Defense in Yongsan-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, he was discharged in March 2012. Kim's first post-army acting project was horror film "Two Moons" (also known as "The Sleepless"), released in July. This was followed by television romantic comedies "I Need Romance 2012" in June, and "Cheongdam-dong Alice" in December.

List of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Saqlain Mushtaq

Saqlain Mushtaq, a former Pakistani cricketer, took 19 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. A five-wicket haul (also known as a "five–for" or "fifer") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded by cricket critics as a notable achievement, and fewer than 40 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm off break bowler who represented his country between 1995 and 2004, Saqlain was described by the BBC as "a revolution in the art of attacking off-spin bowling". Saqlain was named by "Wisden" as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 2000.
Saqlain made his Test debut in 1995 against Sri Lanka at the Arbab Niaz Stadium, Peshawar. His first Test five-wicket haul came in 1997 against the same team at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. In January 1999 against India at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He repeated this feat only once more in his career, at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi during the second Test of the same series. His career-best figures for an innings were 8 wickets for 164 runs against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in November 2000. He took ten or more wickets in a match on three occasions.
Having made his One Day International (ODI) debut in September 1995 against Sri Lanka at the Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala, Saqlain's first ODI five-wicket haul came the following year, against New Zealand, a match Pakistan won at the same venue. His career-best bowling figures in ODI cricket were 5 wickets for 20 runs against England at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in 2000. As of 2012, Saqlain is one of the four bowlers to achieve an ODI hat-trick (three wickets in consecutive deliveries) on two or more different occasions, both against Zimbabwe; one of his hat-tricks came during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Saqlain took thirteen five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and six in ODIs. As of 2012, he is fourth in the list of five-wicket haul takers for Pakistan, all formats of the game combined.
