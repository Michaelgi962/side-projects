Anticipatory Systems; Philosophical, Mathematical, and Methodological Foundations

Anticipatory Systems is a book by Robert Rosen, conceived in the 1970s and published for the first time in 1985. The book describes the way that biological systems anticipate the environment. The book draws from mathematics, in particular category theory, in describing the way systems can anticipate.
The first five chapters of the book are about modeling: Rosen shows that natural systems, physical things in the world, are modeled by formal systems, which are at their heart mathematical. These formal systems simulate the natural systems. But in order to provide anticipatory knowledge, they must produce predictions ahead of the predicted phenomena.
Publication History.
The first edition of Anticipatory Systems was published in 1985 by Pergamon Press. The second edition of Anticipatory Systems was published in 2012 by Springer.
Publication details.
The second edition includes a fifty page prolegomena by Mihai Nadin, as well as contributions by Judith Rosen and John J. Kineman. The book is the 27th volume in the International Federation for Systems Research International Series on Systems Science and Engineering, a series edited by George Klir.
Critical Reception.
A review by Eric Minch of the first edition called the book "radical and profound".
Related work.
Rosen followed this book with a text called "Life Itself" that discussed the mathematical, scientific, and ethical issues related to generating artificial life.
A. H. Louie, one of Rosen's students, published a tutorial article on the book, explaining, among other things, the mathematical concepts behind the book 
Errata for the first edition.
Conjunction and disjunction terms are reversed in the text, pages 60–68, but the mathematical expressions are correct.
Footnote 8 missing from page 384: probably the reference on 382 should be to footnote 7.
Pages 327 and 328 are swapped.
Errata for the second edition.
Conjunction and disjunction terms reversed on pages 59–67
Page 350 indicates a footnote 8 that does not show up on page 352: the indication probably should be footnote 7.
The page swap problem from the first edition now occurs on pages 302-303 of the second edition.
p. 302: "above are" should be directly followed by "retained... on the bottom of page 302. Then on page 303: We recall a linkage relation is of the form" should be followed by equation 5.29 and what follows until the bottom of page 302, when "If we do this" is followed by equation 5.30; then the book is back in order.

Drexel 4257

Drexel 4257, also known by an inscription on its first page, "John Gamble, his booke, amen 1659" is a music manuscript commonplace book. It is the largest collection of English songs from the first half to the middle of the 17th century, and is an important source for studying vocal music in its transition from Renaissance music to Baroque music in England. Many songs also provide commentary on contemporary political events leading up to the Restoration.
Belonging to the New York Public Library, it forms part of the Music Division's Drexel Collection, located at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Following traditional library practice, its name is derived from its call number.
Historical context.
Before researchers took active interest in it, the field of 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period. That attitude was carried through the beginning of the 20th century, where in the first edition of the "Oxford History of Music", Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.
Vincent Duckles thought one reason for the negative attitude might have been the lack of published sources: Between 1627 (the publication date of John Hilton's "Ayres or Fa-las") and 1651 (John Playford's "Musical Banquet"), there appeared only a single publication of British vocal music: Walter Porter's "Madrigales and Ayres" of 1632.
Scholarly work on Drexel 4257 was one of the major reasons for a change in attitude. With over 320 songs, 250 of which contain music, it is "the largest single body of early 17th-century English songs that we know." "The composers ... all belonged to the small world of court musicians that suffered disruption during the English Civil War and the Commonwealth of England. Some began their careers late in the reign of James I, most saw service in court of Charles I, and a few survived to return to their posts at the invitation of Charles II." For the most part, their active careers were over by 1660 or shortly thereafter.
The compiler (or compilers) was not an antiquarian: this collection of songs was intended for practical use, and represents the generation of English composers active between 1630 and1660. As such, Drexel 4257 "stands as the record of English musical and literary taste as it developed over a period of some thirty years," moving from the late Jacobean era to Restoration periods. Though its musical contents may sometimes be variable, its main interest is that, as a document of its time, it reflects contemporary taste, offering comments on contemporary events and references to the past.
By virtue of its repertoire and of the period covered, Drexel 4257 is closely related to other 17th-century English music manuscripts: 2240 (British Library Deposit), Drexel 4041 (New York Public Library), Don.c.57 (Bodleian Library), Add. 29,396 (British Library), Add. 11,608 (British Library), MS B.1 (Bodleian Library ), Add. 31432 (British Library), Add. 10337 (British Library), F.5.13 (Trinity College, Dublin), Egerton 2013 (British Library), Drexel 4175 (New York Public Library), Add 29381 (British Library), MS 1041 (Lambeth Palace Library), and MS 87 (Christ Church Library).
General and physical description.
The binding of Drexel 4257 measures . It contains 227 leaves which measure (the leaves' varying length can add or subtract several millimeters to their respective measurement). 
As the image at left indicates, the volume was rebound on December 6, 1944 by Neumann Leathers of Hoboken, New Jersey. The folios are not numbered, but each song is numbered. Using different methods of enumeration, scholars have disagreed on how many songs are contained in the manuscript. Hughes wrote that the collection contained 246 songs, 146 of which are by unidentified composers, but he was only counting songs with "a musical setting sufficiently complete to make identification possible." Duckles claimed there were 325 different songs numbered 1 through 329: two songs occur twice ("Keepe on yor vayle and hide yor Eye" nos. 134 and 237, and "If thou wilt loue me I'le loue thee" nos. 174 and 215). Additionally, nos. 275 ("Stay, stay, prate noe more") and 324 ("I haue reason to Fly thee") are satirical replies to anti-Royalist lyrics not included in the manuscript. No. 206 is blank and not identified in the index, and the song "Why sligh'stt thou her whome I aproue" is both nos. 222 and 223. There are also two songs listed in the index for which no space was allotted. For Duckles, eighty-five of the 325 songs are lacking music and have either just titles, or titles and lyrics only. Elise Bickford Jorgens counted 327 songs, including songs listed in at least one of the two tables of contents but for which there is no music. (This article and the table below uses Jorgens' enumeration.)
The breakdown of the 97 songs by known composers is as follows: John Gamble (28), Henry Lawes (28), William Lawes (10), John Wilson (11), William Webb (8), Thomas Brewer (3), Robert Smith (2), Nicholas Lanier (2), Walter Youckney (2), Robert Johnson (1), John Withy (1), and Charles Coleman (1).
Folio 1 verso contains a bawdy lyric followed by the inscription written twice, "John Gamble his booke amen 1-6-5-9 ano Domini." The material on Folio 2 recto is from a later date. The upper half of the page contains an engraved portrait of Gamble, printed by W. Richardson in 1795, pasted in. The lower portion contains a brief biographical inscription concerning Gamble in the hand of the former owner, Edward F. Rimbault. A note giving a brief description of the contents has been tipped in near the center of the binding.
There are two tables of contents. The first, with the heading "The Cattalogue" on folios 3r-5r, is a numbered list of songs from 1 through 266. Starting with song no. 201, the style of enumeration varies inconsistently: no. 201 is listed as 2001, 220 is listed as 20020. Additionally, there is a group of songs incorrectly altered to 300s. The second table, on folios 5v-8r, has no heading but is an alphabetical grouping of songs where in each letter the songs are listed sequentially. This list was apparently compiled after the manuscript was completed and includes all songs except nos. 314-317. It is written by the same hand as the enumerator of songs 177-266 in "The Cattalogue."
The manuscript as currently bound (the date accompanying the binding information on the inside rear cover is stamped Dec. 6, 1944) has some songs out of sequence (nos. 331-340), surrounded by no. 311 and 312.
Dating.
The date of 1659 (from Gamble's inscription on 1v) has been a source of puzzlement to those who have studied the manuscript. Willa McClung Evans, consulting Edward Heawood's study of watermarks (used to date paper), noted the watermark, a fleur-de-lis, was of undetermined origin, but was also used in Fuller's "Holy State" of 1652, and Denis Petau "History of the World" of 1659. Charles W. Hughes believed the book was begun around the turn of the 17th century - a hypothesis rejected by Jorgens who notes that it contains works by Henry Lawes, born in 1596. Hughes believed the terminal date was at least 1660, as some of the songs refer to Charles II who assumed the throne in 1660. Duckles noted that the earliest lyrics were from "England's Helicon" (1600) and "Davison's Poetical Rhapsody" (1602). Duckles felt that 1659 is close to the terminal date, noting that no songs had been added after the Commonwealth period, and no younger composers were included in the collection.
Provenance.
Though writers disagree on details of the handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they all agree that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given that there is a concentration of his work in that part of the manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.
After Gamble's death in 1687, nothing is known of the manuscript for over 150 years. The first published reference to it comes in 1846, where it is mentioned in volume 19 of the Percy Society's "Early English Poetry, Ballads, and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages" as being in the possession of one of the editors of the series, Edward Francis Rimbault. An organist and musicologist, Rimbault took a keen interest in English music and voraciously collected rare books, scores, and valuable manuscripts. Upon his death, his extensive and valuable library was auctioned by Sotheby's over the course of five days. The Rimbault auction catalog entry for the Gamble manuscript reads:
A collection of upwards of 300 songs by Wilson, Lawes, Johnson, Gamble, and other English composers, containing also the autograph inscription, "John Gamble his book, Amen. 1659 Anno Domini"
Hughes quotes a contemporaneous report of the hammer price and comment: "Thirteen guineas, for America." The reference was to the Philadelphia-born financier Joseph W. Drexel who had already amassed a large music library and purchased about 300 lots from the Rimbault auction. Upon Drexel's death, he bequeathed his music library to The Lenox Library. When the Lenox Library merged with the Astor Library to become the New York Public Library, the Drexel Collection became the basis for one of its founding units, the Music Division. Today, Drexel 4257 is part of the Drexel Collection in the Music Division, now located at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
Organization.
Duckles noted that there are subsidiary groups organized by composer: Henry Lawes (nos. 26-36), William Webb (nos. 160-166), Robert Smith (nos. 237-238),Thomas Brewer (nos. 244-245), Robert Johnson (nos. 108-109), and John Gamble (nos. 292-319). Similarly is the group of three songs set by John Wilson for Richard Brome's play "The Northern Lass" (nos. 45, 46, and 47).
The first 47 songs are love lyrics by poets of the Jacobean Court including Ben Jonson, William Shakespeare, Robert Herrick, Thomas Carew, John Suckling, Beaumont and Fletcher. After no. 47 a new spirit is suggested by song no. 48 "You madcapps of England that merry will make," a lusty drinking song that indicates a political shift after 1640. Deliberate segregation is in evidence between songs nos. 48 and 80, where there are a series of 32 ballads and popular songs, in contrast to the art lyrics of the first few songs. There is a brief return to the elevated nature in songs nos. 154-76. Thereafter, popular and sophisticated songs are mixed.
Handwriting.
Hughes and Duckles both believed that the manuscript was written by at least two individuals. Hughes characterized the first hand as a "neater, older hand" dating from either at the end of the 16th century or beginning of the 17th century (a date disputed by subsequent writers - see above). The second hand copied the newer songs (including some by Gamble) and were written in a more careless hand. Hughes believed that this evidence suggested that the manuscript was begun by an unidentified person and was continued by John Gamble himself commencing with song no. 177.
Following Hughes's view, Duckles also believed the manuscript was written in two hands. In his view, the first hand wrote the titles for songs nos. 1-176 of the Cattalogue, and the second hand, probably that of Gamble himself, wrote of nos. 177-266 (leaving space left to accommodate future additions) as well as the alphabetical index. Duckles described the writing style of Hand 1 as favoring "round, compact letter forms, vertical alignment, calligraphic flourishes on capitals and heavy down strokes," when writing with a broad pen. Duckles admits that Hand 1 has "two forms": "When the hand writes with a finer quill, the letter forms are more loosely connected, the flourishes a little more pronounced, and there is a slight inclination to the right." Hand no. 2 has a "pronounced slant to the right, letter forms are thin and elongated and the pen is a fine one." Duckles observed that hand no. 2 participated slightly in the preparation of part 1 (nos. 1-176) with only six songs, but all of the text incipits. Likes Hughes, Duckles also felt that Hand 2 is probably that of Gamble.
Duckles hypothesized that the first hand might have been that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and is believed to have been his teacher. Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that the handwriting does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.
Jorgens disagreed with both Hughes and Duckles and saw three different hands. Based on the two tables of contents, Jorgens surmised that all three copyists had access to the book at one time. She characterized the first hand as "firm, bold but well-controlled secretary hand," the second hand as "looser and somewhat lighter secretary hand" beginning with song no. 38, and a third hand, "rougher, slanted, inclined towards the Italian style" that begins with song no. 46. All three roughly equal; by no. 177 the first two have dropped out. Hand Three has entered all of Gamble's songs and is probably his. It also has entered text incipits. Since these incipits do not correspond with other known songs, they are probably the work of Gamble.
Hulse identified the first hand of the Gamble manuscript is probably that of poet Thomas Jordan (ca. 1612–1685), the same hand as manuscript PwV18 in the University of Nottingham, as well as other Jordan manuscripts in Harvard University and Bodleian Library. Hulse showed that Jordan and Gamble were involved in the same London circle of theatre musicians and composers for many years, culminating in Jordan's preface for Gamble's "A Defence for Musick" published in 1659. She identifies songs nos. 4, 16, 32, 45, 47, 99, 154, 155, 169, 170, 175, 176 and the text incipit of 96 as being copied by Jordan.
Politics.
The lyrics to a number of songs have references to contemporary politics and events. "Since Itt hath bin lately inacted high Treason" (no. 313) carries a strong suggestion of reaction to contemporary British history. One song, "Beat on, proud billows," was known to have been written by Roger L'Estrange while he was imprisoned in Newgate Prison during Oliver Cromwell's rule (1645–1648).
Some songs express regret for a better past. "Listen iolly gentlemen Listen & be merry" (no. 63) praises the reign of Charles I (indirectly criticizing the then-current regime). The lyric of "Reioyce all England" contrasts the 13th-century hero Guy of Warwick with current rulers. One song alludes to the marital difficulties between Charles II and his Portuguese wife, Catherine of Braganza. Another example of distrust of foreigners can be seen in the lyric "Harke harke Ile tell you news from the Cort ... all ye french ... now are all sent back to France." Charles II also figures in "God bless our noble king," which comically describes the king's progress from Whitehall to St Paul's Cathedral.
"You madcaps of England" describes frivolous English soldiers at the Siege of La Rochelle, including characters named "Wentworth" (referring to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford) and "Murrey" (referring to Robert Moray). Other names mentioned include: Wilmot, Weston, George Symon, Steadlinge, Hugh Pollerd, and "Game" possibly John Gamble.
Some songs reveal prejudice against Puritans. No. 92, ""Cock Lorrell inuited ye diuell his gestt," concerns Cock Lavorel, known as a rogue and highway robber, as friends with the devil. "The purelings of the Citty" (no. 70) is an exception, praising a Protestant service.
Duckles took note of the bold lyrics to song no. 73:
"Ye giddy poets that purloin <br>from sea and land the greatest store <br>to deck her ffading wenches fine, <br>what would you do with such a whore?" 
Duckles clarified the meaning: "The outspoken vulgarity was not necessarily result of personal taste but a reflection of Royalist protest against Puritan morality, intended to shock the taste of Parliamentarians."
Topical or literary content.
Hughes argued that, unlike a textbook compilation of exemplars, Drexel 4257 shows a variety of good and mediocre poetry. Most songs deal with love, and range from flowery rhetoric to frank accounts of love-making. A few, however, deal with topical matters. There are two songs related to Christmas: "Beate upp a dromm" depicts feasters in a mock battle with the cold in which the feasters win, and "Christmas is my name ffar have I gone" was a popular ballad which appeared in a number of 17th-century sources. In this song, the personification of Christmas comes from far away to discover that his friends and other residents have deserted the country in favor of the city. The song concludes with a lament that universal welcome is gone because the Protestants and Puritans disassociate themselves from Christmas. Similarly (with fewer political overtones), the song "Ladies you loose yor time" expresses preference for city life over that of the country.
The song "Oh yt mine eyes", a graphic meditation on the Crucifixion of Jesus, is the only song in the collection to deal with a religious subject.
The song "Nor loue nor fate dare I" by John Wilson bears the inscription "composed for the comedy "The Northern Lass"". Although this is the only song that the manuscript indicates is from a drama, at least 26 songs have texts from dramas or masques, attesting to Gamble's association with the theatre.
The songs composed by Gamble are best characterized as drolls. Drolls were collections of "cavalier wit, much of it trivial, repetitious and derivative, but at the same time containing some work of genuine literary value. Their tone was seldom dignified, often frankly sexual, and characterized by a persistent undertone of anti-Puritan feeling." Similar examples can be found in the work of Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew and John Suckling.
Musical content and style.
Hughes cursorily observed that Drexel 4257 contains no naturals—sharps are used to cancel flats, and flats are used to cancel sharps. He noted that technical blunders such as parallel fifths and octaves are to be found as well as other kinds of mistakes.
Duckles's dissertation explores the transition from the lute song, representing an older style of composition appropriate to the waning of Renaissance music, to the continuo song, reflecting newer Baroque music practice. It's not always an easy form of composition to assess: lutes were not always used for songs, and sometimes were used even after ascendancy of the continuo song. General characteristics of the lute song are smooth, flowing, and restrained lines, while the continuo song is more vigorous, abrupt and discontinuous. The harmonies in lute songs are an outgrowth of their melodic lines, while in continuo songs they define the structure. Lute songs tend to be loose and melismatic with frequent repetitions of verse fragments, while continuo songs are more closely tied to the rhythm of the text. Dissonance and chromaticism are used sparingly in lute songs while continuo songs show increasing use of chromaticism for more dramatic rather than pictorial underscoring. Generally, English composers were more concerned with capturing verbal rhythms than producing dramatic effects.(Hughes noted that Restoration lyrics typified Baroque figures of speech in their use of florid lyrics.) Use of these techniques in England indicate their adoption from Italy, where they were first used. Previously, it had been thought that English composers either didn't know about them, or weren't interested. But a comparison of Drexel 4257 with another of Gamble's books in the British Library, Additional 11608, where some of the songs appear in an embellished form, indicate that British composers and singers did occasionally adopt a more florid style.
Duckles examined the song "If Loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue" by Thomas Campion which appears as no. 10 of Drexel 4257 and was also published in Campion's "Third Book of Ayres" from about 1617. Campion was generally a conservative composer. In the version present in Drexel 4257, the melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to the declamatory text, so that the speed of the verse accelerates naturally, an alteration which Duckles finds an improvement over the original. Many songs are recitative-like. In some of these songs, the bar is enlarged as it approaches the cadence, suggesting a ballad singer who briefly pauses to catch his breath. The hemiola a consistent practice in English music of this time.
Many songs are 6/4 meter, while some suggest that they are adaptations from violin tunes. Yet, the barline does not always reflect the verbal rhythm. In comparing the song "Ballowe my babe lye still and sleepe", no. 46 of Drexel 4257, with the version that appears in Elizabeth Roger's Virginal Book, Duckles notes that the (earlier) virginal version is in duple meter with no trace of hemiolas, while the version in the Gamble manuscript has them, suggesting a modernization of an older song. Another example of continuo style is "Like Hermitt poore in pensiue place obscure" (no. 15), a lyric attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh and dating from 1591. In comparing Alfonso Ferrabosco's setting from his Ayres of 1609 to one by Nicolas Lanier in Drexel 4257, Duckles admits the possibility that Lanier's may have been inspired by that of Ferrabosco. But the musical characteristics of the Lanier setting, including simplicity of texture, distinct phrases, use of an échappée, and the suggestion of a rhythmic motif through use of a recurring pattern of eighth notes, point to contemporary text setting techniques. The song "Drowsie sun, why dostt thou stay" by Thomas Brewer (no. 253) shows expressive false relations and harmonic word painting, foreshadowing later developments in British sacred music. Brewer's songs are among the earliest examples of the Italian pathetic style in English music and represent the mature style of continuo song. Devices such as an octave leap look away from lute song to continuo song.
Not all songs with recitative-like musical lines indicate modernism.There are dance songs that contain elements of an ostinato bass, passamezzo antico and the romanesca—all characteristics of Renaissance rather than Baroque periods. Several tunes and texts are of 16th-century origin had long been in the repertoire, among them: "Greensleeves," "O mistress mine," and "Back and sides go bare." With these exceptions, the earliest songs date from Jacobean period. A comparison with anthologies published by John Playford in 1652, 1653 and 1659 indicates particular songs were popular. That selections were copied into the book attests to their popularity even after tastes had changed due to the Restoration. Similarly, the song "I went from England into ffrance," a satirical narrative, refers to the song "John Dory," indicating that song's continued popularity. (It had appeared in Thomas Ravenscroft's "Deuteromelia" of 1609, though probably dates earlier). "When ye Chill Charockoe blowes" is a song containing both declamatory and tuneful styles. It is a drinking song, whose erratic harmony suggests frequent cadences, and whose angular melody which "moves with great vigor," This is in contradistinction to the lute song that emphasized continuous flow and smooth melodic motion.
Duckles identifies two styles of songs of the collection: "The declamatory air" (reflecting modern style), and "the tuneful air" (reflecting the older style, a vestige of Renaissance musical practice). The tuneful air could be composed based on a preexisting tune or a tune intended to be a dance form. In examining lyric forms, Duckles identified the ballad as one type of lute song. The ballads found in Drexel 4257 are all of a sophisticated type in which satire and parody are important elements. The ballad as simple narrative or topical ballad are not represented.
Warning that one must be wary of the fluid nature of musical genres, Duckles categorized the following songs from Drexel 4257 as ballads: 46, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 70, 74, 76, 79, 92, 103, 104, 105, 116, 119, 120, 121, 123, 131, 142, 144, 145, 146, 147, 186, 214, 271, 272.
Duckles identified these songs as being in the declamatory style: 4, 12, 15, 20, 22, 26, 30, 31, 33, 83, 89, 108, 132, 160, 161, 162, 164, 168, 172, 182, 188, 198, 206, 238, 239, 240, 243, 247, 249, 253, 256, 260, 261, 262, 269, 274, 277, 280, 284, 285, 292, 299, 306, 311, 315, 316, 317, 323, 326.
Duckles observes that by 1651, the transition from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.
Significance.
In his dissertation, Duckles summed up Gamble and his manuscript:
List of songs.
This table is based on the table of contents listed in Jorgens, supplemented with composer, lyricist attributions and other remarks from Duckles 1953.
Facsimile.
A facsimile of the manuscript was published as "Drexel Ms. 4257: John Gamble, "His booke, amen 1659"", in "English Song, 1600–1675: Facsimiles of Twenty-Six Manuscripts and an Edition of the Texts", vol. 10 (ISBN 978-0-8240-8240-6), by Garland Publishing of New York in 1987, with an introduction by Elise Bickford Jorgens.

Cole Porter in a Modern Mood is the debut album by American jazz pianist Randy Weston, recorded in 1954 and released on the Riverside label as a 10-inch LP. 
Reception.
Allmusic awarded the album 3 stars with the review by Alex Henderson stating, "back in 1954 -- when a 28-year-old Randy Weston recorded "Randy Weston Plays Cole Porter in a Modern Mood" -- saluting Porter wasn't an idea that beboppers had run into the ground and beaten to death. It was still an intriguing idea, and the element of intrigue is definitely present on this record... the pianist's career as a leader was off to an impressive start".

Malin Kundang (film)

Malin Kundang (Anak Durhaka) (literally "Malin Kundang Child") is a 1971 film directed by D. Djajakusuma and adapted by Asrul Sani from the folktale of the same name. It follows a young boy who forgets his roots after spending much of his childhood at sea. Starring Rano Karno, Putu Wijaya, and Fifi Young, the film was a commercial failure.
Plot.
Malin (Rano Karno) is a young boy who lives in Sumatra with his mother (Fifi Young) and sister; his father had disappeared at sea several years earlier. When a group of pirates land at the village, Malin catches the eye of their leader, Nakoda Langkap, who takes the boy as his own. As they are leaving the village, they pass the ship of another pirate, the slaverunner Nakoda Hitam. Nakoda Langkap and his men take the ship, wounding (evil pirate captain) and freeing the slaves. One, a boy named Lalang, is orphaned when his mother is killed in the battle; Nakoda Langkap takes him in as a son too.
Nakoda Langkap raises the boys to be good sailors and respect others. He also honours his promise to Malin's mother, bringing the boys back to visit her after a hundred full moons have passed. The now-adult Malin (Putu Wijaya) is pleased to see his mother, promising that he would rather turn to stone than forget her, and Malin's sister falls for Lalang. As they leave the village, they once again run across Nakoda Hitam. In the ensuing battle, Nakoda Langkap is killed and Nakoda Hitam is captured. Malin, now the leader, promises to spare Nakoda Hitam in return for the location of his buried treasure. Upon receiving the information, Malin surrenders Nakoda Hitam to the police then smiles when the pirate is hanged.
Malin turns out to be a cruel leader, drastically different than his adoptive father. While Lalang and the lieutenant look on, Malin follows one of Nakoda Hitam's men to his secret island refuge, where he kills all present – including women. Although Malin finds the treasure, including a golden throne, several of his men rise against him, including Lalang; they are banished to the sea in a small boat, eventually landing in Malin's village.
Several years later, Malin has become a rich man and is married to a Chinese princess. When they are sailing near the village, Malin's wife asks for coconut water and to stretch her legs; reluctantly they put ashore, where Malin is accosted by his mother and Lalang. When he denies that she is his mother, the villagers and Malin's men fight. As Malin and his wife escape, a storm breaks out and the ship collapses. The following morning, as Malin's mother weeps, they discover that Malin has become stone.
Production.
"Malin Kundang" was written by Asrul Sani, who adapted a Minang folktale of the same name. However, the film changed several aspects of the folktale, such as the ending. In the original story, Malin had turned to stone after his mother cursed him; however, Sani considered it illogical for a Muslim mother to curse her son, no matter what his sins.
Funding for the film came from Elly Yunara, the wife of the recently decease film producer Djamaluddin Malik. Her production house, Remadja Ellynda Film, produced the film. It was directed by D. Djajakusuma, who had previously had experience in adapting part of the Mahābhārata in "Bimo Kroda" (1967). Cinematography was handled by Kasudllah, while editing was done by Soemardjono and music was supplied by Frans Haryadi.
Rano Karno, son of the actor Sukarno M. Noor, was cast as a young Malin. He attended the audition with his friend Itang Yunasz and, displeased with the changes to the story, blurted out "That's not how the story goes." Djajakusuma was impressed and immediately cast him; it was Karno's first film role. Putu Wijaya – better known for his work in theatre – was cast as the adult Malin. Fifi Young, who had been active in film since 1940, was chosen as Malin's mother.
Release and reception.
"Malin Kundang" was released in 1971. The Indonesian film critic Salim Said wrote that the first portion of the story was well-done, considering Rano Karno perfect for young Malin and the story well put together. However, he considered the choice of Wijaya to be a poor one, as the actor did not resemble Rano Karno in the slightest.

Italian submarine Archimede

Archimede was a built for and operated by Italy's "Regia Marina" during World War II. She was launched in 1939 as the second "Archimede" to replace the name ship of the s secretly transferred to the Nationalists in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. 
When Italy declared war in June 1940, "Archimede" was one of eight submarines assigned to the Red Sea Flotilla at the Italian naval base of Massawa, in Italian East Africa. The first war patrol on 19 June was terminated at Assab on 26 June after problems with the air conditioning system intended to reduce temperatures in the warm water of the Red Sea. Leakage of chloromethane refrigerants caused central nervous system poisoning in the recirculating air during submerged operations. Four crewmen died 23 June 1940. A replacement commanding officer left Assab on 3 July to return "Archimede" to Massawa. Repairs kept "Archimede" in port until September. As British forces captured Italian East Africa, "Archimede" left Massawa on 3 March 1941 to sail 12,700 miles around Africa to France on its seventh war patrol. "Archimede" arrived in Bordeaux on 7 May 1941 after refueling from the German tanker "Nordmark" en route. After two unsuccessful BETASOM war patrols, "Archimede" sank its first ship off Brazil on the tenth war patrol. "Archimede" again sank a single ship on its eleventh war patrol. On the twelfth war patrol, "Archimede" was sunk off Brazil by United States Navy VP-83 Consolidated PBY Catalinas on 15 April 1943 (date is also given as 16 Mar 1943 & 16 Apr 1943). A single survivor was rescued after spending 29 days in a life raft.

Anton Schott.
Supergirl and Cat Grant enter Arkham Asylum in order to have a sit down with the Toyman. It seems Cat has been receiving a doll on her doorstep each time a kid in Metropolis is reported missing by the papers. Cat wants to know why Toyman has been sending the dolls to her. Toyman confesses he loves children and he would do nothing to harm them. Supergirl uses her brute force to get any real answers out of Toyman but she has her own reasons for interrogating Toyman. Kara uses her x-ray vision to see if Toyman is a robot or the real Winslow Schott but the real reason why she is threatening Schott because Winslow had a hand in the destruction of New Krypton. Schott was the one who triggered Reactron's self-detonation. Unfortunately, Kara can tell from Schott’s vitals that he is telling the truth but Cat refuses to let Toyman go so she waves one of the dolls in Schott’s face. In an instant, Schott recognizes the craftsmanship of the doll and just as Schott was about divulge some information, the doll became animate. The doll attacks Toyman with a knife and it begins to stab him in the chest. Kara holds back Cat and watches as the doll nearly kills Schott. Kara destroys the doll with her heat vision and rushes Schott to the infirmary. Cat insults Supergirl by saying her rash actions could have cost them any possible lead to finding the children. Kara leaves Arkham and takes her anger out on Riot, Shrapnel, Baroness Blitzkrieg as well as Composite Superman before returning them to Ryker’s. Later on, Supergirl meets with Lana Lang because Kara could tell Cat has her personal vendetta against Toyman. Lana reveals that one of Toyman's robots accidentally killed Adam Grant, Cat’s son and Superman was the one who held the boy in his arms but he still allowed Schott to live. In recent months, Lana has noticed Cat has been directing a lot of her anger toward teenagers who are ruining their lives. Meanwhile, Cat returns to her apartment after visiting her son’s grave but suddenly a doll-like figure with claws for hands appears out of nowhere and attacks Cat. Cat uses her taser gun to stun the doll but Cat soon realizes that the doll is actually one of the missing children. Someone has surgically altered the child and turned them into a cybernetic doll assassin. It is at this point, Cat’s front door opens and the orchestrator of these kidnappings reveals himself as Anton Schott aka the Dollmaker.
The Dollmaker is accompanied by two other doll assassins who bound and gag Cat as they all head back to Dollmaker’s base of operations. Anton reveals his origins to Cat as his assassins make Ms. Grant more comfortable. It turns out Winslow was more compassionate towards other children than his own son even though Anton showed great promise as a skilled toymaker. As for Anton’s mother, she took off with Anton because she was under the impression that her husband was a pedophile but later she abandons Anton, leaving him to fend for himself. With nowhere to go, Anton found one of his father's abandoned toy factories and began to adapt his father’s motif in order to make a name for himself. This turn of events only enhanced Anton’s sadistic compulsions which was brought on by abandonment issues. Anton kidnapped Cat because he knew what his father did to her so he asks Cat if she wants to be his new mother. Cat spurns Anton’s heartfelt plea so in a fit of rage, Anton decides he will shutdown all of his doll assassins which will kill them. Cat swallows her pride and calls out to Supergirl because she refuses to let her anger towards Supergirl to endanger the children. Supergirl crashes through the Dollmaker's hideout, uses her heat vision to free Cat and she disarms the doll assassins. Cat knocks out Anton with her right hook and Anton is most likely sent to Arkham Asylum to work out his issues with his father.
Barton Mathis.
The third Dollmaker debuted as part of The New 52. As a child, Barton Mathis went on several "hunting trips" with his father Wesley. During these hunts, Barton watched as his father killed people and then cannibalized them. He would also witness his father being shot down by a young cop named James Gordon. After spending only a year in foster care, Barton disappeared for years before he resurfaced as the criminal Dollmaker. His mask is partially made of skin from his deceased father.
Dollmaker first appeared where he visited Joker in Arkham Asylum. As it turns out, the Joker had planned to be caught and taken to Arkham for the sole purpose of an audience with this man. Joker tells Dollmaker that he killed his son earlier because he insists on only the father's expertise. According to their plan, the Dollmaker cuts the skin from the Joker's face leaving the madman ecstatic with the pain. Tonight, they will celebrate their rebirth.
Upon being ambushed by masked men upon finding the body of Ray Quimby, Batman encounters Dollmaker who has brought in what appears to be Commissioner Gordon.
As Batman crawls towards Commissioner Gordon, he knows that the body isn't Commissioner Gordon. Dollmaker announces his plans to make a doll of Batman as well, and then sell him off to the highest bidder. Naturally, Batman resists and is forced to fight all of the Dollmaker's family with rapidly spreading paralysis in his body. With Jack-in-the-Box clinging to his back, Batman desperately leaps out a window in order to escape becoming too vulnerable in front of his enemy. Struggling to stand, he drags the downed minion with him. At the abandoned hospital, Commissioner Gordon overhears the Dollmaker explaining that he plans to remove his prisoner's liver before beginning the doll process, because he must save a life before his can be taken. He expresses an interest in filming the procedure, as he has a personal vendetta against Gordon. Commissioner Gordon is unaware on who Dollmaker is talking about, but Dollmaker responds that is staring his own victim in the face - suggesting that the skin making up his new face actually belonged to his father. When Batman arrives at the hospital upon receiving Dollmaker's message, Batman hears Dollmaker's voice and is attacked by Dollmaker's henchman Bentley who chokes Batman into unconscious. When Batman awakens in a makeshift boxing ring, Dollmaker then begins to auction a hanging Batman who is hanging upside down near some Joker Dolls.
Suspended like a marionette, Batman is forced to fight thugs that are dressed as Joker. A crook named Raju arrives at Dollmaker's lair to offer Dollmaker a large sum of money in exchange for Batman. Raju's client is Penguin who plans to pay Dollmaker some gold bars in exchange for Batman's body. Dollmaker uses magnetized cables to immobilize Batman completely, and Batman is surprised to realize that the cables are of his own design as the Dollmaker has somehow gained access to Wayne Corp. Regardless, he uses a demagnetizer in his suit to free himself, leaping forward and knocking Penguin's thugs out. Freed, he easily defeats the thugs dressed as the Joker and begins his search for the Commissioner. Meanwhile, Dollmaker receives a call from an unseen benefactor who warns him that the GCPD are on their way. The man orders that Commissioner Gordon be killed. Dollmaker and Matilda make their escape while his thugs Bentley and Sampson gather all the organs and body parts they can salvage. Meanwhile, Batman begins kicking down every door in the hospital, in search of his friend. Batman defeats Dollmaker's henchmen Bentley and Sampson and finds Commissioner and Olivia Carr as they get to safety. Seeing Dollmaker escaping in a car, Batman leaps down onto the roof crushing it down around him. Unexpectedly though, the car explodes. When Batman investigates, he discovers that the car was filled with dummies and that Dollmaker must have escaped in the police chopper.
During the "Forever Evil" storyline, Dollmaker is among the supervillains that are recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.
Powers and abilities.
The first Dollmaker uses dolls that he can control.
The second Dollmaker can use dolls that he has modified into mobile weapons.
The third Dollmaker is a gifted surgeon.

SS Principessa Mafalda

The SS Principessa Mafalda was an Italian transatlantic ocean liner built for the Navigazione Generale Italiana (NGI) company. Named after Princess Mafalda of Savoy, second daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III, the ship entered NGI's South American service between Genoa and Buenos Aires in 1909. At the time of her completion she was the largest Italian passenger ship afloat. The "Mafalda" was known for her luxury and was the preferred mode of travel for such celebrities of the day as Carlos Gardel.
On 25 October 1927, while off the coast of Brazil, a propeller shaft fractured and damaged the hull. The ship sank slowly in the presence of rescue vessels, but confusion and panic resulted in 314 fatalities out of the 1,252 passengers and crew onboard the ship. With a casualty rate ten times that of the "Andrea Doria", the sinking is the greatest tragedy in Italian shipping and the largest ever in the Southern Hemisphere in peacetime. Due to the human error involved and high mortality among steerage passengers, the disaster has been called the "Italian "Titanic"." The nature of the vessel's sinking has also been compared to the modern Costa Concordia disaster.
Early history.
"Principessa Mafalda" was built at Cantiere Navale di Riva Trigoso with her sister, the . In 1907 the "Jolanda" sank during her launch in a dramatic spectacle. This was due to mistakes in launch procedures and not flaws in vessel design. "Mafalda" was launched on 22 October 1908 without her superstructure installed in order to avoid the same accident. She was finally completed on 30 March 1909 and became the flagship of the NGI. In 1910 she played a part in the development of long distance radio communication when Guglielmo Marconi conducted experiments on board.
Specifically designed for voyages between Genoa and Buenos Aires, "Mafalda" was considered the best ship on this route for several years. She had a luxurious two-story ballroom, spacious cabins in Louis XVI style and traveled at a relatively rapid 18 knots. On the eve of World War I, 22 August 1914, she made her one and only voyage between Genoa and New York City. During the war she was requisitioned by the Italian Royal Navy and housed officers at Taranto. She resumed her prewar South American service in 1918. She remained the NGI's flagship until 1922, when the assumed the role. By 1926 the "Mafalda" had made over 90 long but uneventful round trips and had a reputation for "faded luxury."
The last voyage.
On 11 October 1927 "Principessa Mafalda" sailed from Genoa for Buenos Aires with intermediate stops scheduled at Barcelona, Dakar, Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo. The ship was under the command of Captain Simon Gulì with 971 passengers and 281 crew aboard. She also carried 300 tonnes of cargo, 600 bags of mail, and 250,000 gold lire destined for the Argentine government. The trip was to take 14 days.
It soon became apparent that the stately old ship was in a poor condition. "Mafalda" left Barcelona almost a day late due to mechanical problems and several times it slowed to a complete stop on the high seas, sometimes for hours. Water in bathrooms became intermittent. A refrigeration system failure caused tons of food to spoil, resulting in numerous cases of food poisoning. At the stop at Cape Verde, Captain Gulì telegraphed the company to request a replacement vessel, but was told "Continue to Rio and await instructions." In the era of Italian fascism he could only do his duty. Resupplied with fresh food and partially repaired, he brought his ship out into the North Atlantic.
By October 23 the "Mafalda" had developed a small but noticeable list to port. The passengers, who had received few explanations for the previous breakdowns, now began to worry the ship was taking on water. Although far behind schedule, she was finally traveling at full steam off the coast of northern Brazil on the 24th. Life aboard then flowed more quietly with the longest part of the journey nearly complete. On the occasion of the passage of the equator, a line-crossing ceremony was organized on deck with orchestra music and a huge cake.
Around 17:15 hours on 25 October 1927, 80 miles off Salvador de Bahia Brazil near the Abrolhos Archipelago, the ship was rocked by several strong shudders. Passengers were initially assured that this was only due to the loss of a propeller and the situation was not dangerous. However, on the bridge the engineer reported that the starboard propeller shaft had indeed fractured, but it had also traveled off its axis and cut a series of gashes in the hull. Complicating matters, the watertight doors could not be fully closed. At 17:35 Captain Gulì sounded the alarm and ordered the radio officer to send SOS. He also stated this was merely a precaution as he believed his ship could stay afloat until the next day. Two ships, the SS "Empire Star" (British) and SS "Alhena" (Dutch), arrived quickly. With clear weather and rescue nearby, it seemed that the situation was in hand. However, panic began to spread among both passengers and crew.
There are many conflicting versions about what happened next. What is known is that officers had difficulty maintaining order, some passengers were armed, and the ship kept moving forward in a wide circle for at least an hour. Rescue vessels received confusing signals about how to assist. Not all the lifeboats could be launched due to the list, some were rushed by the crowd, and many were not even seaworthy. Furthermore, an unknown but significant number of crew members left the ship at the outset. The first lifeboat away was filled almost entirely with crew, including the purser. Those officers and crew that did remain on board, while heroic, were largely ineffectual given the situation. The rescue vessels were therefore left to manage matters on their own as darkness fell. A few remaining lifeboats did shuttle between "Mafalda" and "Alhena", but some capsized in the panicked throngs. Amid final scenes of chaos, the captain drowned and the chief engineer reportedly shot himself.
At 22:10, nearly five hours after the initial accident, "Malfalda" sank stern first. Since she went down on a busy shipping lane, a number of vessels arrived to assist. By daybreak the "Alhena" had picked up over 450 survivors, with "Empire Star", "Formosa", "Rosetti" and other vessels rescuing the rest. Many controversies remain about exactly what transpired and who was responsible for the death toll. Reports of gunfire, sharks in the water, exploding boilers, and nearby ships refusing to assist were widely published but never confirmed. Even the exact wreck site remains a matter of dispute today.
Aftermath.
An investigation by the Italian Navy Board began immediately following the tragedy. It determined that a joint in the propeller casing was to blame for the accident and it ordered that propeller shafts on all Italian-registered vessels be fitted with devices designed to avoid such accidents. It also determined that six lifeboats located on the stern could not be used because of poor placement. Issues of the vessel's age, inadequate maintenance or the problematic actions of the crew were not investigated. However, the NGI was ordered to pay heavy compensation to the families of victims.
A journalistic investigation conducted years later in 1956 by the weekly "L'Europeo" established more of the historic facts known today. A 2012 analysis demonstrated that while the number of casualties among steerage passengers was indeed high, the death rate between first and third class was actually the reverse of that of the , more first class passengers died (51.8%) than steerage class deaths (27.8%).
Namesake.
In what has been called a further "twist of fate" to the history of the "Principessa Mafalda", Princess Mafalda of Savoy herself also met with tragedy. Captured by the Nazis during World War II for use as a hostage to manipulate her father, she died at Buchenwald concentration camp in 1944.

Ludwig Hupfeld

Ludwig Hupfeld (26 November 1864 - 8 October 1949) was a musical instrument maker and industrialist.
Life and work.
Hupfeld was born in Maberzell (now Fulda in Hesse), Germany.
Hupfeld attended the Royal Grammar School in Fulda and undertook commercial training in Cologne.
In 1892 he acquired the music trade company J. M. Grob & Co., based in Leipzig which was originally a music shop and manufacturer of mechanical instruments.
After taking over the company, the name was changed to "Hupfeld Musical Instrument Works". When the company was converted to a corporation in 1904, the name of the company became "Ludwig Hupfeld AG".
In 1911, the company moved to Leipzig, to a large factory in Böhlitz-Ehrenberg. Over the years, Hupfeld bought up several construction companies, and in 1925 following a merger with the Zimmerman company, it lead the industry in Europe. In the 1920s, Ludwig Hupfeld AG was the largest manufacturer of mechanical musical works in Europe.
One of the most popular products since 1902 was the self-playing piano Phonola "American", the European counterpart of the pianola. Hupfield had some success with the 1908 reproducing piano "DEA", which later took over the role as "Triphonola" successfully. The mechanical violin "Violina", an orchestrion, despite an ingenious design, was seen as aesthetically unsatisfactory and therefore less successful.
During World War II, the company made ammunition boxes and fuel tanks in the factory. At the end of the war, as an ex-arms manufacturer, it was made a state-owned enterprise by the communist authorities of East Germany in 1949. The company was renamed "VEB Deutsche Pianounion" and continued to produce pianos under the brand name "Hupfeld".
Hupfeld died in Leipzig on 8 October 1949, and was buried in the Leipzig South Cemetery in his family tomb, where he was joined in 1953 by his wife Elisabeth (née Beyer, born 1874)

2012 Zintan clashes

The 2012 Zintan clashes begun on 17 June 2012, after a Zintan man was killed after stopping at a checkpoint during an attempted transport of tanks from a weapons depot in Mizda to Zintan.
During the Gaddafi era, land was often taken from one tribe and diapered to others, creating and exacerbating tensions between the tribes. Long standing resentment was further compounded with groups such as the Mashashya tribe choosing not to join in the rebellion against Gaddafi, whilst fighters from Zintan played a prominent role, fighting in favour of the NTC.
As a result of the fierce fighting between the different tribes, government troops were deployed to the area on 17 June. The area was subsequently declared a military zone. The deployment of soldiers and imposition of a government enforced ceasefire managed to prevent further clashes, with Government spokesman Nasser al-Manaa declaring that fighting had ended on 18 June.

FastTrack Scripting Host

Overview.
FastTrack Scripting Host (FastTrack or FSH) is a scripting language for Windows IT System Administrators. The product’s goal is to handle any kind of scripting that might be required to automate processes with Microsoft Windows networks.
Manufacturer.
FastTrack is produced by FastTrack Software, which is headquartered in Aalborg, Denmark. The product is promoted by the manufacturer as a one-stop shop for Windows script writers and it’s development paradigm is “one operation = one script line”. Script writers use a purpose-built editor to create scripts, inserting script lines via menus, drag’n drop or simply typing them in. Scripts may be used out of the box, created from scratch, imported from forums or other users, or customized from product documentation.
Types of Scripts.
Simple scripts include:
More advanced scripts include:
Basic Structure.
Under the hood, scripts comprise commands, functions, collections and conditions. When a script is executed, these components are converted into many lines of C# code, sometimes hundreds of lines, depending on the particular script operation. Scripts can be compiled into EXE files or MSI packages and treated as standalone Windows applications.
History.
FastTrack Scripting Host (FastTrack) was first developed around 2006 to ease the administration burden of IT System Administrators on Windows networks. 
Product Idea.
The idea for the product came from founder and President of FastTrack Software, Lars Pedersen, who has a background in systems administration. Previously with Telenor, Denmark’s major telephone company, Pedersen performed various roles in systems administration, programming and web development. He also worked as a consultant and developer on several major projects at various companies in Europe.
Dissatisfied from his own experiences and frustrations administering Windows networks, Pederson looked for a way to make life easier for system administrators. In particular, he wanted something that could minimize the amount of time needed each day to perform routine and mundane tasks, which was a waste of time and expertise that should have been committed to other projects. 
Development.
Leading a small team of developers, Pedersen developed FastTrack Scripting Host to simplify and automate the routine tasks of system administrators. The resulting product is definitely a scripting language, but it can be used intuitively like a programming language, without requiring users to learn syntax or other concepts typically associated with programming languages. 
Marketing.
In April 2010, FastTrack Software entered into an agreement with Binary Research International, based in the city of Milwaukee, USA to market and sell the product globally.
Awards.
FSH received a Windows IT Pro Community Choice award in 2012.
Versions.
The first version was produced in June 2006 and contained 51 components, which are the commands, functions, conditions and collections making up FastTrack.
The following table summarizes dates and components for major releases. Companies and organizations such as NOAA, Kawasaki, and Goodyear have used and implemented the FastTrack Scripting Host.

The Nepean Times

The Nepean Times was a weekly newspaper first published in the Australian city of Penrith on March 3, 1882. 
The Nepean Times (NT) was a weekly newspaper published by the Colless family in Penrith, New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1882, the Nepean Times, was the only local newspaper for most of its 80 years in publication. The newspaper was published every Saturday until 13 August 1936 when it changed to a Thursday publication day.
Up until the establishment of a locally produced newspaper in the Penrith district, Sydney and Parramatta newspapers, such as the Evening News, Cumberland Mercury and Sydney Morning Herald circulated in the local area and carried local news reports.

The Lost Prince (Edwards novel)

The Lost Prince is a sequel to the best-selling novel "The Little Book" by American writer Selden Edwards. It was published by Dutton in August 2012.
Plot.
"The Lost Prince" follows the character of Eleanor Burden, an 1890s Boston socialite who has resigned herself to marrying the man she should be with rather than the man she wants, whom she lost in Vienna. What separates her from others of her station and background is that Eleanor believes that she has the ability to predict all of the major historical events that will occur while she is alive. Dismissed as a hysteric, Eleanor must decide whether or not fate is predetermined or if she possesses the ability to change future events as well as her own life.
Critical reception.
Reception for "The Lost Prince" has been positive and nationwide, with Publishers Weekly praising Edwards' way of "connecting historical events and philosophical ideas, and also connecting this book to his first." Kirkus Reviews also praised the novel, saying "throughout the novel, Edwards skillfully intertwines Eleanor’s predestined fate with her relationships to Freud, Jung, J. P. Morgan, William James and other historical figures...a powerful, intense and fascinating read."
The Los Angeles Times hailed its treatment of "big ideas" such as destiny, history, the role of the individual, and undying love. According to the "Times", “there's no denying the sweetness of unshakable faith that infuses the core of "The Lost Prince."”
"The Washington Post" described "The Lost Prince" as “ingeniously plot-driven: Each chapter constitutes a polished short story in which Eleanor pulls off some near-impossible task to bend current events to the dictates of the journal."
The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: “This is a strange and unique love story. On the heels of Edwards' debut novel, "The Little Book", the author has crafted a daring follow-up…the book is a meditation on love, faith, free will and one's purpose in life.”
The Deseret News hailed "The Lost Prince" as “a provocative novel of destiny, free choice and sacrifice...Edwards' novel is a compelling tale of sacrifice in the name of family and love, reminding readers of the importance of each decision they will make throughout their lives, whether significant or trivial.”
The Santa Barbara Independent noted that both "The Lost Prince" and "The Little Book" “proceed from the premise that Wheeler Burden, Harvard baseball hero, philosopher, and rock star, has the ability to travel back from California in 1988 to Vienna, Austria, circa 1897. The action that follows from this rent in the fabric of time brings together such historical figures as Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, and William James with the Burden clan, who are strictly the product of Edwards’ remarkable imagination.”
The North County Times found that “Edwards' love for his characters -- even the frightening J.P. Morgan with his bulbous nose -- is striking and effective. They have blossomed and thrived under the caring, brilliant tutelage of a gifted author, whose enthusiasm seems boundless.”
Marie Claire Magazine hailed it as a great summer read, saying that "With a cast of characters that includes Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and William James, it's like "Midnight in Paris" for the neurotic set."
The Historical Novel Society praised "The Lost Prince" as "entertaining, thought-provoking, and highly recommended." "Capital Region Living Magazine" found it "compelling and fascinating...if you enjoy great story-telling, Selden Edwards is an author you should read."

I-TEC Maverick

The I-TEC Maverick is a powered parachute aircraft with a roadable fuselage.
Design and development.
Equipped with the largest powered parachute certified by the FAA, the Maverick received experimental aircraft airworthiness certification on April 14, 2008, with N-Number 356MV.
Capable of interstate speeds on pavement, the Maverick's dune buggy-like frame of chromoly tubing gives it the ability to be used off-road. Additionally, the vehicle can deploy a parafoil and fly as a powered parachute. It weighs about 1100 pounds and has a useful carrying capacity equivalent to a Cessna 172 (fuel and 550 pounds cargo). With a 22-foot mast, the Maverick can take off and land in weather conditions that other powered parachutes would not be able to safely operate in. Steve Saint has said he envisions the Maverick being useful to the Huaorani and other Indian groups, farmers and ranchers, pipeline inspection crews and anyone else with a requirement to traverse rough, roadless ground. "Popular Mechanics" gave it their Breakthrough Award in 2009. In 2012, the Maverick was accepted by the United States FAA to operate as an Experimental homebuilt, S-LSA, or E-LSA.

Bobak Ferdowsi

Bobak Ferdowsi () (born November 7, 1979) is an American systems engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He served on the "Cassini–Huygens" and Mars Science Laboratory "Curiosity" mission.
Ferdowsi gained brief media fame in August 2012, when he wore an unusual mohawk hairstyle during the "Curiosity" landing. It unexpectedly became an iconic image of the event with coverage in the news and social media, U.S. President Obama even commented on the popularity of "Mohawk Guy".
Life and career.
Ferdowsi was born November 7, 1979, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is of Persian descent; his father immigrated to the United States from Iran. His parents met in college. Soon after birth he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he stayed until age 11, then moved to Tokyo in 1991, where he attended the American School in Japan, graduating in 1997.
The same year, he enrolled at the University of Washington where he majored in aerospace engineering, a childhood dream. While there he did research under Nobel Laureate Hans Georg Dehmelt in the Department of Physics. In 2001, he enrolled at MIT and joined the Lean Aerospace Initiative where he stayed until 2003.
Ferdowsi joined JPL in late 2003, and worked on the Mars Science Laboratory mission through its successful landing nearly nine years later on August 6, 2012. He was also Science Planner on the "Cassini–Huygens" mission.
Media appearances and NASA advocacy.
Ferdowsi became a media "sensation", or "meme", when during the August 6, 2012, landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars, he wore an unusual mohawk hairstyle that was seen on NASA TV's live broadcast of the event. He was seated in a prominent camera position and his mohawk unexpectedly became an iconic image of the landing. Ferdowsi explained that he wore a new haircut for every mission and the mohawk was chosen by his team by popular vote.
When President Barack Obama called to congratulate the team, he noted the popularity of the "Mohawk Guy," saying "it does seem NASA has come a long way from the white shirts, dark-rimmed glasses, and pocket protectors. You guys are a little cooler than you used to be." Ferdowsi said in another interview that he did it to help lighten the seriousness of the workplace and "If my mohawk gets a few more people excited about science and this mission, that's awesome."
Ferdowsi took part in the Second inauguration of Barack Obama (January 2013) marching in the parade alongside replicas of Curiosity and the Orion spacecraft, along with other NASA scientists, as part of the agency's official Presidential Inaugural Weekend. Ferdowsi also took part in Obama's State of the Union address on February 12, 2013, where he was seated in First Lady Michelle Obama's box "to highlight President Barack Obama's call for more visas for skilled immigrants in the fields of math, science and engineering."

<doc id="36682514" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36682514" title="Shadow Council">
Shadow Council

Shadow Council is the name of a villainous organization in Marvel Comics.
Fictional organization history.
The Shadow Council first came into view in the 19th Century when Confederate soldier Aloysius Thorndrake found a portal to Mars and was altered by a being called the Abyss granting him immortality. He formed the Shadow Council where he acts as its Director. For a hundred years, the Shadow Council has been working with various governments and parties to prepare for the arrival of the Abyss.
The Shadow Council have their first encounter with the Secret Avengers on Mars where Sharon Carter is attacked by someone that looks like Nick Fury as she has the Crown of Tentacles. When the Secret Avengers find some mind-controlled Shadow Council members, they end up shooting themselves upon failure which reaches "Nick Fury" as the Secret Avengers are attacked by Nova who is possessed by the Serpent Crown.
Ant-Man stumbles into a portal called the Vanishing Point that took him to the Shadow Council's citadel in Texas. At the same time, "Nick Fury" is meeting with Aloysius Thorndrake who is musing over the Crown of Tentacles. When Aloysius is alerted to the events on Mars, he orders Fury to send the 9th Legion.
Aloysius later shows the rest of the Shadow Council the Serpent Crown as Ant-Man goes through the Vanishing Point to stop the kamikaze Shadow Council soldiers.
When Captain Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter ask Nick Fury about the character that looks like him, Nick Fury states that it was a Life Model Decoy that was stolen by Scorpio who modified it's AI to have it think it's Nick Fury and had been deactivated many times. Five years ago, a mysterious man reactivated the Life Model Decoy and helped it to escape where the mysterious man named it Max Fury. In the present, Max Fury is doing some research on the Secret Avengers in the Shadow Council's headquarters. The mysterious man that helped Max Fury to escape is revealed to be John Steele who tells Max Fury that the Secret Avengers must be watched or taken down if necessary.
Aloysius Thorndrake has somehow partially resurrected Shang-Chi's father Zheng Zu (who used the alias of Fu Manchu) as the Shadow Council agents are digging for the Eyes of the Dragon. Max Fury then reports to Aloysius that they have found the Eyes of the Dragon. Aloysius and Max then move on to the next part of the plan that involves capturing Shang-Chi and using him to restore Zheng Zu to life.
Prince of Orphans and Valkyrie arrive at Zheng Zu's grave where they find a few Shadow Council agents on guard knowing that someone would come to the grave. They defeat the Shadow Council agents and take one of them prisoner and taken to an unknown location. Meanwhile, Max Fury informs Aloysius Thorndrake about the two unfortunate mishaps. Zheng Zu is not pleased for there is only two days left to complete the ritual needed to restore himself to life. Aloysius promises to Zheng Zu that Max Fury and John Steele will handle this.
John Steele and Max Fury plot a strategy to attack the Secret Avengers. Captain Steve Rogers suspects that the Shadow Council will use the Eyes of the Dragon to drain Shang-Chi's lifeforce and make Fu Manchu immortal. While Fu Manchu and the Hai-Dai attack Hong Kong, John Steele and Max Fury infiltrate the Secret Avengers' Quinjet and have taken Sharon Carter hostage. John Steele contacts the Secret Avengers offering them a trade...Sharon Carter for Shang-Chi. If the demands aren't met, Sharon will be dead by tomorrow.
While the other members of the Secret Avengers ask Captain Steve Rogers who John Steele is, Max Fury approaches Sharon Carter in her jail cell. They trade words about their difference in opinion in what they do. Max then tries enticing her to join the Shadow Council which Sharon refuses. When Captain Steve Rogers and Shang-Chi meet with John Steele for the exchange, John Steele ends up attacking Captain Steve Rogers and manages to overpower him. While Shang-Chi is in his jail cell, it is shown that Moon Knight had infiltrated the Shadow Council.
Zheng Zu prepares the ritual that will enable him to use Shang-Chi's life-force to resurrect himself. Disguised as a Shadow Council agent, Moon Knight gives the signal and the Secret Avengers drop in on the Shadow Council. Captain Steve Rogers fights Max Fury while Valkyrie fights John Steele. Prince of Orphans disrupts the ritual causing Zheng Zu to turn to stone which Prince of Orphans shatters. When the temple begins to crumble, the Shadow Council take their leave while Valkyrie manages to defeat John Steele enough for the Secret Avengers to apprehend him and remand him to the Raft.
John Steele is hooked up to a device that would scan his memories for info on how he joined the Shadow Council. The only problem is all that they are getting are flashes until Captain Steve Rogers recognizes a memory of his last mission with Steele. He volunteers to be hooked up to the device so that he could fill in the gaps. In the memory, Captain Steve Rogers (back when he was Captain America) and John Steele infiltrate a Nazi fortress in Prussia. Inside, they find a few mutated prisoners who were experimented on. John Steele soon notices a Shadow Council agent leading a strange alien creature somewhere. Steele then insists that Rogers get out before he shoots him, flat in the chest. Captain Steve Rogers disconnects from the machine where he was aghast that what happened in the memory was not what he remembered. Unfortunately for him, John Steele has woken up and broken free. Steele gets his mind back and Rogers offers him a chance to get back at the Council.
While investigating the Secret Empire's hidden underground city beneath Cincinnati, the Secret Avengers are attacked by some Shadow Council agents. The Secret Avengers discover that the Shadow Council plans to make use of the city-sized version of Doctor Doom's time machine which would transport the city of Cleveland above and drop it and any other city on different locations. Beast makes a makeshift nuclear bomb which destroys the device as the Secret Avengers escape from the hidden city.
Arnim Zola 4.2.3 (a flawed copy of Arnim Zola's consciousness in a robot body) was recruited by the Shadow Council. He faced the Secret Avengers who were investigating the Shadow Council's mining operations inside of a bad continuum (a malformed reality). The Secret Avengers managed to defeat Arnim Zola 4.2.3.
In Aniana, Symkaria, the Secret Avengers stumble upon a plot by a drug lord named Voydanoi to sell his super-soldier drugs to the Shadow Council. The Secret Avengers managed to thwart Voydanoi's plot.
Max Fury and the Shadow Council form the ninth incarnation of the Masters of Evil consisting of Princess Python II, Vengeance II, and Whiplash IV. They were discovered by the Secret Avengers during a mission run by Captain America and Hawkeye. While setting up the Shadow Council's headquarters in Bagalia, Max Fury recruits numerous other criminals including Black Talon, Brothers Grimm, Carrion III, Constrictor, Crossfire, Diablo, Griffin, Killer Shrike, Lady Stilt-Man, Pink Pearl, and Squid to join the Shadow Council's Masters of Evil. Max Fury and the Masters of Evil capture John Steele after he attempts to escape Bagalia with the Serpent Crown and the Crown of Thorns. In order for the Masters of Evil to obtain the Crown of Wolves for the Shadow Council, Max Fury hired Taskmaster to retrieve it only for Taskmaster to demand more money for the job and he hid in the Hole. Upon claiming the Crown of Wolves, Max Fury was unable to harness its power because he is a Life Model Decoy. When Taskmaster donned the Crown of Wolves, he was unable to control the powers of the Abyss. Under the control of the Abyss, the Masters of Evil and the other people in Bagalia make their move as the Secret Avengers fight to keep the people under control of the Abyss from leaving Bagalia and invading other countries to spread the possession to other people. While possessed by the Abyss, Taskmaster used its power to take control of the villains and have them board an airplane out of Bagalia to spread the campaign of the Abyss. While the others fight the possessed villains and other people, Venom uses his symbiote to break the Crowns and capture Taskmaster.

Mass assignment vulnerability

Mass assignment is a computer vulnerability where an active record pattern in web application is abused to modify data items that the user should be not normally allowed to access — for example password, granted permissions or administrator status.
Many web application frameworks offer an active record feature, where database record fields can be modified by automatically generated web API methods. If the framework doesn't prevent that automatically and the application designer doesn't mark specific fields as immutable this way, it's possible to abuse the API call and modify these hidden fields.
These vulnerabilities were found in applications written in Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC Framework, Java Play framework, PHP and Python. 
In 2012 mass assignment on Ruby on Rails was published that allowed injection of unauthorized SSH public keys into user accounts at GitHub.

Solar power in the Netherlands has installed 655 MW of photovoltaics as of the end of 2013. Subsidies of 33 euro cents per kWh introduced in 2008 had failed to attract much development, but when they were curtailed, Dutch banded together to make large purchases at discount instead.
In 2011, a 500 kW solar array was added to the roof of Rotterdam’s central train station.
A project to add solar panels to roads and bike paths, called SolaRoad, is expected to generate 50 kWh/m² each year. A trial was planned for Krommenie, near the train station.
In 2012 solar capacity more than doubled to 321 MW with new added capacity of 175 MW.
According to the Dutch grid operators, solar capacity grew to a cumulative power of 655,4 MW at the end of 2013 
In addition to photovoltaics, solar energy is used extensively for heating water, with 332,217 kW(th) installed by the end of 2011.

Elgin v. Department of Treasury

Elgin v. Department of Treasury, , was a United States Supreme Court case where the court ruled that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) gives exclusive jurisdiction for claims under the Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Additionally, the Court held that the Act bars federal district courts from ruling on matters related to the act including adverse employment actions of the federal departments, and allows the Merit Systems Protection Board to hear constitutional arguments for wrongful employee severance and adverse employment actions. It was a 6-3 decision, with the majority opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas. The case greatly limited the recourse of federal employees to the courts for adverse employment practices, allowing such recourse only to a few, specific courts as aforementioned.
Prior to the Supreme Court.
Michael B. Elgin and several other employees of the U.S. Department of the Treasury were fired for willingly and knowingly failing to register for the Selective Service, pursuant to , which forbids any federal executive employees who committed such an omission. Elgin challenged his discharge before the Merit Systems Protection Board, claiming such a requirement is unconstitutional being a bill of attainder and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since only males are required to enroll in the Selective Service System. The Merit Systems Protection Board referred the case to an administrative law judge, who dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that an employee is not entitled to Merit Systems Protection Board review of agency action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. The same administrative law judge also ruled that the Merit Systems Protection Board did not have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes.
Rather than appealing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as is required by the CSRA, Elgin and several other petitioners appealed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The court denied Elgin's claims, holding that the act and Elgin's severance was constitutional. Elgin appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which ruled that federal district courts have no jurisdiction over the matter. Elgin appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

TrustedID

TrustedID Inc., founded in 2004, is an American identity protection company. The company's suite of products include free and paid services that help consumers detect risk of identity theft and control the use of their personal information. The company sells its products through a range of different channels, including major companies and through its website.
History.
TrustedID was founded by Scott Mitic and Omar Ahmad following personal experiences with identity theft. The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and also has offices in Berkeley and Santa Maria, California. The company's early angel investors include Esther Dyson, Kim Polese, Brad Garlinghouse and Geoff Ralston, with institutional investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Opus Capital. In 2011, the company acquired two companies, Unsubscribe.com, funded by Charles River Ventures, and Reppler.com, funded by Norwest Venture Partners. In 2012, TrustedID acquired Catalog Choice, a non-profit founded by Chuck Teller. In 2013, the company itself was acquired by Equifax, one of the three national credit bureaus.
Product.
TrustedID's initial products, launched in 2006, were focused on helping consumers "freeze" their credit reports, following the advent of legislation that gave individuals the right to stop the three national credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and Trans Union, from selling and individuals credit data without first getting consumer consent. Over time, the company evolved to include a broader set of protections, including anti-malware protection, fraud alert placement and black market Internet monitoring. In 2009, the company added credit report monitoring which alerted users to changes in their credit data which indicated possible risk of identity theft. 
With the acquisition of Reppler.com in 2011, TrustedID added capabilities in reputation management for individuals, alerting them to content on the Internet which would create negative consequences, especially during life transitions such as college and new job application processes. 
With the acquisition of Catalog Choice in 2012, TrustedID started offering "opt out" services to United States consumers. The company has now processed more than 25 million consumer opt outs, covering more than 10,000 direct mailers. A mobile application released by the company in 2011 makes it possible to opt out of advertising mail by simply taking a picture of the front of the piece of mail.
TrustedID also offers data breach response solutions for companies and organizations that expose confidential customer, employee or member information.
Marketing.
TrustedID markets primarily through partners, including Dell, FICO and Intuit. With Dell, TrustedID's free identity protection comes bundled with each consumer computer sold in the United States and paid products are offered as an upgrade when customers customize the configuration of their personal computer. TrustedID's products are also marketed and promoted by Suze Orman through channels that include QVC and the celebrity's own website. TrustedID's products are also included in Suze Orman's Approved Card, a prepaid debit card.
Awards & Recognition.
The company's flagship product, IDEssentials, was awarded "Best-in-Class" by Javelin Strategy & Research in 2010.

Meinarti

Meinarti (also Mainarti) was an island with a Nubian village in northern Sudan. Situated in the Nile, Meinarti was just north of the 2nd Cataract, a few kilometers upstream of the Sudanese border town of Wadi Halfa. A little further north, on the west bank, was the ancient Egyptian settlement, Buhen. Meinarti was excavated by William Yewdale Adams from 1962 to 1964, prior to perishing in the 1960s with the rising of Lake Nubia due to the Aswan Dam. 
The oldest settlement dates back to the late Meroitic period around 300 AD. The early settlement seems to have been destroyed by a flood of the Nile. Around 660 AD, during the Christian period, the city of Nobatia was built, measuring 200 x 80 meters. The main construction material, mud bricks, were used on low stone base dwellings. The population is estimated to have been 200 to 400. The church was situated east of the village. During its renovation, a tile floor of quarry stones was applied over a concrete floor. There was also a 12th or 13th century monastery on the south side of the island, dedicated St. Michael. The village was probably abandoned in 1286 by order of King Semamun due to an impending attack by the Mamluks. The town was re-settled afterwards as, in the middle of the 14th century, it was known to be inhabited by Arabs. The Arabs were expelled in 1500 and a Christian population returned. The island remained populated until the middle of the 19th century. During the Turkish-Egyptian rule, the soldiers of the garrison at Wadi Halfa held he medieval fortress island before the defeat of the Mahdi uprising.

She then worked for the news magazine "Jane's Defense Weekly" from 1988 to 1997 covering national security and defense policy, before joining ABC News as a producer covering the Pentagon, where she won a local Emmy Award.
In 2001, Starr joined CNN as the lead Pentagon correspondent covering national security issues including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Criticism.
Starr has received criticism for her reporting, having been called "a spokesperson for The Pentagon." 
In June 2013, MSNBC reporter Chris Hayes ran a segment in which he argued that Starr's publication of leaked information was at least as potentially harmful to national security as those published by Glenn Greenwald of "The Guardian". He noted the fact that, unlike with Greenwald, politicians and other prominent figures failed to call for Starr's prosecution on the basis that Starr's use of leaked information invariably favoured government interests, implicitly questioning Starr's independence and arguably even her integrity and status as a journalist.

Île aux Basques

Île aux Basques is a Canadian island located in the lower estuary of the St. Lawrence River, about north of Trois-Pistoles, in Les Basques Regional County Municipality of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region of Quebec. The island is part of the municipality of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges.
It is, since its acquisition by Société Provancher in 1929, a protected area as a sanctuary for migratory birds. From 1584 until about 1637 it was occupied several times by the Basques, after whom the island takes its name. Both the lack of space in the Basque Country and the abundance of whales in the St. Lawrence River led to the arrival of the Basque fishermen to the island. The Basque Country was divided between the Crown of France and the Crown of Spain since the 1512 Spanish invasion of the Kingdom of Navarre.
A series of wars and invasions led seafarers to explore further inland from the Atlantic Ocean for seals, porpoises and whales. The Basques also practiced trade with the Iroquois and Algonquins, one of the first places where the legacy of these two cultures can be seen. These facts were confirmed by archaeological excavations in the 1990s at various locations on the island.
The island is long and wide, covering an area of . Its highest point has an elevation of in the center of the island. It is located in the physiographic region of the Appalachia, on the south bank of the St. Lawrence opposite the city of Trois-Pistoles, about east of Quebec City.

The Lac La Belle and Calumet Railroad was an American, narrow gauge railroad that operated in the Keweenaw Peninsula, or the extreme northern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The line ran between a stamp mill at Lac La Belle and two copper mines, the Mendota and the Delaware, from 1883 to 1888, when poor economic conditions forced the line's closure. The defunct company and its tracks were later purchased by the Copper Range Company, which converted the line to standard gauge and changed the railroad's name to the Keweenaw Central. This company failed in 1917, and the former Lac La Belle and Calumet tracks were removed in 1918.

Carolina Christian College

Carolina Christian College (CCC) is a special purpose, undergraduate institution. CCC educates persons for Christian ministries through a program of Biblical and theological studies, general education in the arts and sciences, and professional studies. Emphasis is placed upon cultural awareness and urban ministry that will prepare workers to establish and serve the church in the United States and around the world.
History.
In 1945, Dr. R. L. Peters, an innovative black evangelist from the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, and J. W. West, a well known evangelist of the Appalachian Mountains, agreed together to begin a training school for black men and rural whites that aspired to leadership in Christian ministry but did not have access to quality education in this field. Dr. Peters led the training and equipping work, and Reverend West raised the finances.In a store-front building on Wheeler Street in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, They started a school known at the time as The Christian Institute. This fledgling school facilitated the education of both black and white and male and female students in integrated classrooms during the turbulent days prior to the modern "Civil Rights Movement". Dr. Peters vision and desire to help the hurting and disenfranchised in our community also propelled him to start a mattress factory as his "tent ministry" employing the disabled. This business/ministry later became the "Industries for the Blind" in Winston-Salem. 
In May 2007, the College's Board of Directors renamed the college "Carolina Christian College" . The College has developed a special emphasis on Urban Ministry. This focus is a natural outgrowth of the historical mission of educating African-Americans for leadership and ministry. Carolina Christian College has equipped and educated students from many foreign nations. Throughout its history, many of the College alumni have served in cities across the United States and around the world.
Programs.
The degree programs offered at CCC are: 
Accreditation:.
CCC is chartered by the State of North Carolina as a post-secondary nonprofit institution by the United States Government. CCC is accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE). ABHE is an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education and the Department of Education.
CCC credits are readily accepted in transfer to all colleges of the ABHE as well as to other Biblical and Secular colleges. Many CCC students and graduates have also transferred to secular colleges and universities without loss of credit.

Michael Schofield (campaigner)

Michael George Schofield (24 June 1919 – 27 March 2014) was a pioneer of social research into homosexuality in the 1950s and 1960s, and a campaigner for the Homosexual Law Reform Society at a time before the Sexual Offences Act 1967 partially decriminalised homosexual activity in the UK. He played a prominent role in the law reform lobbies of the 1960s and 1970s. He is the author of many books including "Sociological Aspects of Homosexuality" (1965) and "The Sexual Behaviour of Young People" (1965).
Life and work.
Michael Schofield was born in Leeds in 1919, the fourth child of Snowden Schofield, who was the owner of Schofield's, the largest department store in Leeds for many decades. He obtained a degree in Psychology at Cambridge University, spent the war years as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and then studied at Harvard Business School. During this time, he identified as homosexual and decided to make an original study of the social aspects of homosexuality.
At a time when homosexual activity was a criminal offence, publishing under his own name was too risky and he assumed the pen name of Gordon Westwood. This first book, "Society and the Homosexual", was published in 1952 and was the first non-medical book to be written about homosexuality, and contemporary with earliest just before trials of several prominent people during the 1950s. Later, in 1960 he published "A Minority", the first detailed research into the lives of homosexuals who had not got into trouble with the law and who had not sought medical treatment. His third and major study was finally published under his own name in 1965 as "Sociological Aspects of Homosexuality". In England little of sociological significance had appeared before this; and his work was regularly cited in the debate over law changes. At this time he also became active in the Homosexual Law Reform Society, working with Antony Grey and others.
After these publications he turned his attention to other social issues including single parent families, teenage premarital sex, birth control, abortion, drug taking and prison reform. In 1965 his best known book, "The Sexual Behaviour of Young People", was published. This caused a stir, but was also taught in higher education institutions as much for its methodology as its findings. His later books included "Social Research" (a textbook), "The Strange Case of Pot", "The Sexual Behaviour of Young Adults", "Report of the Committee on the Operation of the Sexual Containment Act". He also wrote many research papers, articles in periodicals and introductions to other books. Schofield spent many years actively supporting various law reform groups. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty) for nine years.
He was active in the campaign against censorship and appeared as an expert witness for the defence of several trials in which publications were tried for their alleged obscenity. He also served on the Government Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence (chaired by Barbara Wootton) that published the Wootton Report (the report on cannabis which suggested that the legal penalties were far too severe). He wrote a minority note for it. On a wider scale, he campaigned to make contraceptives free on the National Health Service and for the Abortion Law Reform Association. He was an early supporter of frank sex education, gay rights and a more tolerant attitude to marital infidelity. He was to be found opposing Mary Whitehouse and her supporters on TV and radio on many occasions, but he made few enemies and many friends. Schofield was the founder and main instigator of a charitable foundation named the Lyndhurst Settlement. Between 1968 and 2005, it donated at least three million pounds to small struggling charities, particularly those groups working for civil liberties and for the protection of the environment.
Schofield retired in 1985 from public life and lived with his partner (whom he met in 1952), Anthony Skyrme, until his death in 2014.
Contributions.
Schofield was amongst the very the first researchers to approach homosexuality outside of a medical or legal framework. His concern was to investigate homosexual life as it was lived by ordinary homosexuals in everyday life. At the time homosexuality was a criminal offence, and such research was difficult to conduct. Jeffrey Weeks lists him with Donald West as a "discreet pioneering homosexual researcher." His first book, "Society and the Homosexual" (1952) was an overview of the topic including early notes on the gay scene in England at that time. His second book, "A Minority", was an original survey study of 127 men, and was the first of its kind. He asked them questions on their background, early homosexual experiences, attempts to combat, the extent of their homosexual acts, their work and leisure and their community integration. The third book, "Sociological Asopects of Homosexuality" (1965), was a comparative study of heterosexuals and homosexuals along three dimensions: in prison, in treatment and others in the community. He concluded:
Homosexuality is a condition which in itself has only minor effects upon the development of the personality. But the attitudes not of the homosexual but of other people towards this condition, create a stress situation which can have a profound effect upon personality development... A proportion of homosexuals are able to withstand this pressure from outside and become social casualties. These are the homosexuals found most often in prisons and clinics... On the other hand the homosexuals who have learnt to contend with social pressures can become adjusted to their condition and integrated with the community. These men are hardly ever found in prison and clinics.
Ken Plummer in "The Making of the Modern Homosexual" remarks that: 
In England little of sociological significance appeared until 1965. Indeed it is tempting to suggest that until that time all the sociological insights, apart from a rather eccentric sociological report prepared for the Home Office in 1958 by Richard Hauser, grew from the work of one man: Michael Schofield, writing under the alias, Gordon Westwood.
A second major contribution was his work, "The Sexual Behaviour of Young People" (1965). This was one of the earliest surveys of sexual behaviour in the U.K.and looked at the behaviour of young people. Five years later these same young people were re-interviewed for a follow up in "The Sexual Behaviour of Young Adults" (1971). Perhaps the most surprising finding of these studies with hindsight is that they reveal the relatively low levels of sexual behaviour of young people at that time. Schofield's work paved the way for much later specialists in the field such as Kaye Wellings. A photographic study by Damien Rudd ("Birds of Panic: Sexual Behaviour of Young People") has also been based on it.

Jyoti Kalash

Jyoti Kalash (Sanskrit: ) is a symbolic representation of Hindu goddess Durga. During Navaratri festival devotees light Jyoti Kalash, in temples of Devi, to appease her. Jyoti Kalash derives its name from combination of two Sanskrit words Jyoti and Kalash.
The Jyoti Kalash, consists of earthen lamps (Diyas) lit with ghee, which are placed on earthen pots (Kalasha), covered with earthen lid. The fire (Jyoti) burns continuously for nine days and nights of Navaratri, symbolizing the divine presence of mother goddess on earth during nine days of Navaratri. Surrounding the main temple are many big halls where Jyoti Kalashas are lit by the devotees are kept for nine days, which are supervised by volunteers, who keep feeding the lamps with ghee for nine days. 
Many people install Jyoti Kalash at their home also during Navaratri. The procession of Jyoti Kalash is taken out on ninth and final day of festival to immerse the Jyoti Kalash in river or other water bodies. 
The Jyoti Kalash procession can be seen in Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and especially in Chhattisgarh, where the festival and installation of Jyoti Kalash is very popular and people throng the temples of Bambleshwari, Danteshwari, Mahamaya, Maoli, Kankalin, Adbhar and many others to install the Jyoti Kalash.

Glenorn

Glenorn is a pastoral lease that has operated as both a Sheep and cattle station. It is located about south east of Leonora and north east of Kookynie in the Goldfields of Western Australia,
The Laverton to Leonora railway passes through the property and had five of its stops being located within the station boundaries.
Initially established by the Horan Bros. who were butchers, in about 1903, the station was running cattle along with a small flock of sheep. The Horans were the first to take up pastoral pursuits in the area, which was mostly a gold mining centre. They has noted that the area was rich in mulga and saltbush year round with abundant natural grasses following rain.
The property was carrying a flock of about 2,000 sheep in 1921.
Sold by the Horan Bros. before 1924, the station was bought by the Foulkes-Taylor Bros., E. L. Lefroy and L. Manning, who together formed the Mt. Malcolm Pastoral Company. In 1925 the station occupied and area of and was running approximately 10,000 sheep and was fully enclosed in vermin-proof fencing. So impressed with the country, the men also bought another of adjoining country to the north that surrounded the town of Morgans which was carrying 1,400 head of cattle and was sold to them by Mr. David Dicks of the Boulder Meat supply. This property known as Mernong gave the company a fairly compact block in excess of half a million acres. One of the company directors, Chas Taylor, was managing the station in 1924.
By 1928 the flock size had been increased to 12,000 sheep with Lefroy and Foulkes-Taylor introducing Peppin blood rams from the Tootra and Cranmore park studs into the flock. The sheep were in splendid condition following a good season.
The station manager, Chas Foulkes-Taylor, left in 1928 to take up Yuin Station in the Murchison region.
Selling 91 bales of wool at the Perth Wool sales in 1929, Glenorn wool attracted an average price of about 12 1/2 d. per pound. Following up with 222 bales in 1930 the average price was lower across the whole market and Glenorn wool attracted an average price of about 11d. per pound.
A good clip was produced in 1949 when a total of 12,245 sheep including 3,084 lambs were shorn to produce 322 bales, the flock size in 1950 was only 3,572 sheep that were shorn in May to yield 89 bales of wool.
In 1954 10 bales of AAA combings attracted price of 114d. per pound.
Glenorn is currently owned by Minara Resources along with three other nearby properties: Nambi, Yundamindera and Minara Stations. Glenorn and Nambi currently run approximately 1,700 head of cattle.

Special Communications Organization

Special Communications Organization (SCO) is Government Organization operated by Ministry of Information and Technology and maintained by Pakistan Army. SCO is playing major role in providing telecommunication services in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan.
History.
SCO was established in 1976 and it remained the single telecommunication network provider in its served areas for about 3 decades having extensive footprint of PSTN, GSM, CDMA and Internet Provision.
Products.
SCO is responsible for providing the telecommunication needs to a population of 4.5 Million spread over 85,793 km2 consisting of the mountainous terrains of Azad Jummu & Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. In addition to the wired landline services SCO is also providing CDMA services. It is also providing cellular mobile service under the brand name of SCOM. SCOM is the first ever GSM service of Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. DSL and Dialup Internet services are provided under the brand name of SNET.
Maintenance.
Maintenance services of SCO are provided by Pak Army.
Controversies.
SCO is often criticized for poor performance and creating obstacles for other carriers in providing telecom services in AJK. SCO was given sole monopoly in AJK and the area suffered and lacked in modern telecom services. However after the 2005 quake, significant loss of life was attributed to not having communication facilities in the area. Subsequent protests resulted in government of Pakistan opening up the AJK for mobile operators which has significantly improved mobile services in the area. However AJK still lags behind in broadband services due to strict hold of SCO on the network access.

Argo-class submarine

The "Argo"-class was a class of two coastal submarines built by Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico in Monfalcone for Portugal but operated by the Royal Italian Navy () after Portugal was unable to pay construction costs. The submarines were built in 1936, and both served in the Mediterranean Sea at the start of the Second World War. The boats were transferred to the BETASOM German submarine base at Bordeaux in 1940, but returned to the Mediterranean in 1941, where both were sunk within a few days of the September 1943 Italian armistice.
Ships.
"Argo".
"Argo" (pennant number AO) was launched 24 November 1936 and completed on 31 August 1937. "Argo" completed two unsuccessful wartime patrols in the Mediterranean before passing the Strait of Gibraltar on 8 October 1940 for an Atlantic patrol to Bordeaux on 24 October. During its first BETASOM patrol, "Argo" damaged convoy HG 47 escort on 1 December and sank a freighter from convoy OB 252 on 5 December 1940. First Lieutenant Alessandro De Angelis was lost overboard and drowned in heavy seas as "Argo" was returning to port. The second and third BETASOM patrols from 27 February to 28 March and from 19 May to 12 June 1941 were unsuccessful. "Argo" left France on 11 October, passed the Strait of Gibraltar on 20 October, and reached Cagliari on 24 October 1941. After refit, "Argo" patrolled off Cape Ferrat from 6 to 21 April and off Cap Caxime (Algeria) from 22 to 29 May 1942, where it sustained damage from aerial attacks requiring another period of repairs. After patrolling off the Balearic Islands from the 15 to 26 October and off the island of Galite (Tunisia) from the 29 to 30 October, "Argo" entered the Bay of Bougie on 11 November 1942 to torpedo the anti-aircraft ship and the troopship "Awatea", which had been damaged by aerial bombing during Operation Torch. "Argo" then patrolled off the north African coast from 17 December to 8 January 1943, and during February, April and June. After two patrols off Sicily in July, "Argo" was refitting at Monfalcone until the armistice of September 8, 1943. "Argo" was scuttled when German troops captured the shipyard on 10 September.
"Velella".
"Velella" (pennant number VL) was launched 18 December 1936 and completed on 1 September 1937. "Velella" was on patrol in the eastern Mediterranean when Italy declared war. After refit at La Spezia, "Velella" sailed on 25 November 1940 and passed the Strait of Gibraltar on 1 December for an Atlantic patrol to Bordeaux on 25 December. After four unsuccessful Atlantic patrols, "Valella" returned to the Mediterranean on 24 August 1941. After refit at Cagliari and training at Pula, "Velella" patrolled without success south of Cape Palos (Spain) in April 1942, south of the Balearic Islands in June, along the Tunisian coast in July, and west of the Island of Galite in August, south of the Balearic Islands in September, in the Gulf of Philippeville and the Bay of Bona in November, north of Cape de Fer in April 1943, and off eastern Sicily in July. Its last patrol was off Salerno, where it was torpedoed by on 7 September 1943. There were no survivors.

A Web of Sound

A Web of Sound is the second studio album by American rock band The Seeds. Produced by Marcus Tybalt and released in October 1966, it contained the single "Mr. Farmer" and the 14-minute closing song "Up In Her Room". The album did not chart, though it has received generally favorable reviews from music critics.
Background and release.
Lead singer Sky Saxon conceptualized the album's cover design depicting the four Seeds members trapped in a spider's web. "A Web of Sound" was produced by Saxon under the pseudonym Marcus Tybalt; Saxon also wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album (two credited under the Tybalt alias), as well as the liner notes. Side one consists of six tracks, beginning with the single "Mr. Farmer" and continuing with other garage rock-sounding songs, most of them short in duration. 
Side two contains only two songs, including the 14-minute closer "Up In Her Room", which features bottleneck guitar, electric fuzz-bass, electric piano, tambourine, and drums.
Released in October 1966, "A Web of Sound" did not receive much attention in the United States for several months until after the band's "Pushin' Too Hard", a song from their self-titled debut album, was re-released and entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 singles chart.
Reception.
Pete Johnson, in a 1967 "Los Angeles Times" review, stated that with "A Web of Sound", the Seeds had "been adopted by the hippies – the flower children – because of their open-ended songs which generally skirt neatly plotted thoughts and didacticism." Some contemporary music critics compare album track "Up In Her Room" to The Velvet Underground song "Sister Ray", which was released a year later. 
In the book "All Yesterdays' Parties: The Velvet Underground in Print, 1966-1971", author Clinton Heylin wrote that "both songs work much the same way [...] listening to them is humming in a room where another dozen people are humming also, in a constant pitch, never varying, unchanging." 
Allmusic's Joe Viglione suggested that "A Web of Sound" also influenced such artists as Iggy Pop and The Stooges and Alice Cooper. Stewart Mason, also of Allmusic, remarked that the album blended "the snotty aggression of ["The Seeds"] a bit with some heavier psychedelic flourishes." Writer Malcolm Russell described "A Web of Sound" as being "more adventurous" than the band's debut album, and said it "brimmed with scratchy mid-60s classics." 
Don Jacobson of "The Beachwood Reporter" called it "one of the all-time craziest mid-60s pioneering rock 'n' roll records." 
Researcher/author Martin C. Strong wrote that the album is "full of weird, psychotic blues highlighting [Saxon's] demented vocal sermonizing on such reliable topics and sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll."

Distribution of lightning

An old estimate of the frequency of lightning on Earth was 100 times a second. In 1997 NASA and National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan launched the first Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) equipped satellite that can detect and record lightning, including in places where there is nobody to observe it.
Lightning is now known to occur on average 44 (± 5) times a second averaged over the entire earth, for a total of nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year.
Ratios of Lightning Types.
The lightning flash rate averaged over the earth for intra-cloud (IC) + cloud-to-cloud (CC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) is at the ratio: (IC+CC):CG = 75:25. The base of the negative region in a cloud is normally at roughly at the elevation freezing occurs. The closer this region is to the ground them more likely cloud to ground strikes are. In the tropics where the freeze zone is higher the (IC+CC):CG ratio is about 90:10. At the latitude of Norway (60° lat.) where the freezing elevation is lower the (IC+CC):CG ratio is about 50:50.
Distribution.
Different locations have different numbers of storms and lightning strikes. In the United States, for example, Florida experiences the largest number of recorded strikes in a given period during the summer season. As much of Florida lies on a peninsula, it is bordered by the ocean on three sides. The result is the nearly daily development of clouds that produce thunderstorms. The west coast of the United States has the fewest lightning strikes.
The map on the right show that lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet. Approximately 70% of lightning occurs on land located in the tropics where the majority of thunderstorms occur. The north and south poles and the areas over the oceans have the fewest lightning strikes. The place where lightning occurs most often (according to the data from 2004 to 2005) is near the small village of Kifuka in the mountains of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the elevation is around . On average this region receives 158 lightning strikes per 1 square kilometer (0.39 sq mi) a year.
Above the Catatumbo river, which feeds Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, Catatumbo lightning flashes several times per minute, 140 to 160 nights per year, accounting for about 25% of the world's production of upper-atmospheric ozone. Singapore has one of the highest rates of lightning activity in the world. The city of Teresina in northern Brazil has the third-highest rate of occurrences of lightning strikes in the world. The surrounding region is referred to as the "Chapada do Corisco" ("Flash Lightning Flatlands").
In the US, Central Florida sees more lightning than any other area. For example, in what is called "Lightning Alley", an area from Tampa, to Orlando, there are as many as 50 strikes per (about 20 per ) per year. The Empire State Building is struck by lightning on average 23 times each year, and was once struck 8 times in 24 minutes.

The European Union lightning maps (EUCLID) and the US and Canada lightning maps put out by the Vaisala company and the Weather TV channel are available in nearly real time. Lightning all over the world is observed by the LIS satellite system. In the US lightning monitoring is done by the National Lightning Detection Network, part of NASA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory.
Maps of the U.S. lightning strike density/km2yr averaged from 1997-2010 are available from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDL)--VAISALA More detailed U.S. regional lightning maps based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) data centered on different cities are put out by the Cooperative Institute for Applied Meteorological Studies at Texas A&M University. Lightning maps that show the lightning activity in North America, Europe, Japan and Oceania in the last 20 to 120 minutes are given on maps put out by the Blitzortung organization.
Electromagnetic Radiation.
NASA scientists have found that electromagnetic radiation created by lightning in clouds only a few miles high can create a safe zone in the Van Allen radiation belts that surround the earth. This zone, known as the "Van Allen Belt slot", may be a safe haven for satellites in middle Earth orbits (MEOs), protecting them from the Sun's intense radiation.

<doc id="36683110" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36683110" title="Ferz (chess)">
Ferz (chess)

A ferz (or fers) is a fairy chess piece that moves like a bishop, but can only go one square.
History and nomenclature.
The ferz is a very old piece, appearing in some very early chess variants, such as Tamerlane chess and shatranj. The advisor in xiangqi moves like a ferz, but has additional restrictions involving where it can move. The ferz was a standard chess piece, until the modern moves of queen and bishop developed.
The piece was originally called the "mantri" (Sanskrit for "minister" or "counsellor"), which was translated by the Persians to "farzin", which means "counsellor" or "wise man". This was shortened by the Arabs to "firz", and this became "ferz" or "fers" in Medieval Europe. Its name later changed to the queen, but when that name started being used for the modern chess queen, its former name "ferz" or "fers" began to be used in chess problems.
Value.
The ferz by itself is worth about half a knight. Three ferzes and a king can force checkmate on a bare king (assuming that all three ferzes are not on the same color); two ferzes and a king can force stalemate on a bare king, but not easily. The endgame of rook versus ferz is a win for the rook. Despite being colorbound, the ferz is the strongest of the basic leapers during the opening phase of the game, even stronger than the wazir, because it has larger mobility forward. A wazir and a ferz can only force checkmate on a bare king, if the bare king is significantly close to a corner that is the same color as the ferz. Two ferzes cannot force checkmate, whether they are on the same color or not. Two wazirs cannot force checkmate. A knight and wazir can force checkmate against a bare king, but a knight and ferz can only do so if the bare king is significantly close to a corner that is the same color as the ferz. The wazir is better than the ferz in most endgames, because of the wazir's ability to restrict squares adjacent to the squares last restricted.

Nikoghos Tahmizian

Nikoghos Tahmizian (1926–2011, ; also spelled: Nikogos Tahmizyan) was an Armenian musicologist, theorist and historian. His professional accomplishments were to decipher neumes ("xaz") of Armenian church music, analyze the musical theory of old Armenia and research the life and works of Armenian composers from medieval times to modern era.
Tahmizian's discoveries in the area of the medieval Armenian notational system open a door to understanding and interpreting the liturgical chants (Шаракан) of the period. His book "Modern Neumology" (2003) summarizes his forty years of research in the field. Several dozen neumatic symbols have now been revealed, defined, categorized and interpreted as a result of his work.
His research into the musical heritage of Armenia revealed and explained the most crucial periods in the history of Armenian music and its notorious representatives. He brought to life the musical contributions of Mesrop Mashtots(arm. Մեսրոպ Մաշտոց) (5th Century A.D.), Sahak Partev (Isaac of Armenia, 4th/5th Century A.D.), Movses Khorenatsi (Moses of Chorene, 5th Century A.D.), Grigor Narekatsi (Gregory of Narek, (Arm: Գրիգոր Նարեկացի), 10th Century A.D.), Nerses Shnorhali (Nerses IV the Gracious, Arm: Սուրբ Ներսէս Դ. Կլայեցի (Շնորհալի), Rus: Шнорали Нерсес 12th Century A.D.), Sayat-Nova (arm. Սայաթ Նովա rus. Саят-Нова) (18th Century), Makar Yekmalian (arm: Մակար Եկմալյան) (19th Century), Tigran Tchoukhajian (Dikran Tchouhadjian) (19th Century), Komitas Vardapet (early 20th Century) and others. His work placed an overall historical perspective of the musical development in Armenia from 5th to 20th Centuries. He categorized the period from ancient times to the 12th century as an ascending era, and the timeframe from 13th to 18th centuries as a period of creative decline.
He also conducted extensive research into the theory of Armenian music from the pagan era to the church music of the 8th Century A.D. In his defining book entitled 'Theory of Music in Ancient Armenia' (published in Armenia, 1977, in Russian) he interpreted and classified the modal system used during this period. He also analyzed the metric and rhythmic constructs and their formational significance. He explained the uniqueness of the Armenian oktoechos and shed light upon the conceptual and aesthetical issues of the medieval music of Armenia. Moreover, he brought into focus the specific characteristics of the Armenian modes as compared and contrasted with Persian, Arabic, Turkish, as well as Greek, Russian and Caucasian modal systems.
Throughout his career, Tahmizian published over a dozen books and around two hundred articles and essays in Armenian, Russian, English, French and Polish. He has also delivered over 60 academic lectures in universities and conservatories throughout the former Soviet Union, as well as London (1978), Rome (1981), Tokyo (1985), Paris (1989), San Francisco (1990) and New York (1993). He contributed to the Russian Music Encyclopedia (published from 1973 to 1982 in Moscow, six volumes, in Russian), and Armenian Encyclopedia (published from 1974 to 1987 in Yerevan, thirteen volumes, in Armenian).
Brief Biography.
Born in Athens, Greece on May 9, 1926. Received elementary education at the local Armenian school, followed by high school at the Melkonian Educational Institute in Cyprus on a merit based scholarship. After graduation in 1945, being recognized as a promising young musical scholar, he received a fully funded fellowship for a seven-year academic course at the Music Conservatory of Brussels, Belgium.
The "Repatriation Movement", however, initiated by the government of post-war Armenia, changed his plans. Along with over hundred thousand Armenians (scattered around the globe as a direct result of the 1915 Genocide) he moved to Soviet Armenia in 1946. In September of that year, he was admitted and started his education at the Romanos Melikian Musical College of Yerevan - graduating in 1950. From 1950 to 1956 he attended the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory, Musicology Department. He completed his graduate studies with a thesis on 13th century Armenian monk Hovhannes Yerznkatzi's views on music theory. From 1947 to 1956 Tahmizian worked at the Yerevan Opera House occupying the chair of third French Horn in the orchestra.
From 1956 to 1960 he completed his post-graduate studies at St. Petersburg State Conservatory under the mentorship of renowned music scholar Christopher Kushnarev. It was here that he met his lifetime soul mate Svetalan Nikitina (later Svetlana Tahmizian) - a talented musician studying with the famous pianist and organist Professor Braudo (Браудо, Исайя Александрович). From 1960 to 1990 he was a senior researcher at Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts (Matenadaran) in Yerevan, Armenia. During the same period he actively collaborated with the Composers' Union of Armenia, Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory and the Armenian National Academy of Sciences. Tahmizian upheld his dissertation for doctoral candidacy in 1962 on the history of Armenian music from 5th to 8th centuries A.D. In 1980 he obtained an honorary doctorate degree presenting the publication of his monumental work "Theory of Music in Ancient Armenia."
In 1984 he was awarded an honorary title for his accomplishments in musical arts by the government of the Republic of Armenia. In 1987 he was granted professorship of musical sciences by the music history department of the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory.
From 1990 to 2011 he resided in Pasadena, California. He was honored to become a US citizen in 1995. During this time he continued his research and involvement in Armenian music history. He published five books and a dozen articles. He also lectured in various US cities.

Cink

Cink (; ) is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Dolenjske Toplice in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Podstenice.
History.
Cink was a Gottschee German settlement. In 1924 the forest railway for the sawmill at Rog was extended toward Cink.
During the Second World War the Partisans established a political school for the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia at the site, which was in operation for nearly a year. From July to August 1942 the command of the Partisan 5th Detachment Group was stationed at Cink after it was relocated from Podstenice, and a party conference was held there from 5 to 7 July or 8 July that year. A logger's cabin or hunting cabin now stands at the site and a plaque was installed on the cabin in 1953.
Mass grave.
After the Second World War, members of the Slovene Home Guard and other armed groups subordinate to the German forces were killed and buried in a mass grave east of the village known as the Double Shaft by Cink Cross Mass Grave (). The victims are believed to have been transported to the site from the prison in Novo Mesto. The shafts are located at the crossroads to Cink on the road from Podstenice. The opening is 21 m long, starting below an old beech grove and continuing along a fence. The bottoms of both shafts are covered by large rocks that fell there from the surface and the entryways to the shafts were dynamited. The grave site is registered as cultural heritage.

George Lang (builder)

George Lang (Laing) (1821 – July 2, 1881) was a stone sculptor, stonemason and builder. He was born in Roxburghshire (now part of Borders), Scotland and died at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. In 1858 Lang moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he successfully tendered on principal government and commercial contracts. These works made him one of the leading Halifax builders of the Victorian era.
Early years.
Trained in Scotland as a mason, George Lang is said to have worked on the Scott Monument in Edinburgh, erected between 1841 and 1846, and then to have emigrated to St John’s, Newfoundland, to work on the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (St. John's) constructed between 1847 and 1850. In 1851 Lang and Stirling began operating the Albert Freestone Quarries in Albert County, New Brunswick, where Lang had been a manager until 1858.
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
His first building was the Halifax County Court House (present-day Halifax Provincial Court (Spring Garden Road)), designed by William Thomas (architect) of Toronto and erected between 1858 and 1860. The building’s architectural exterior is classic with palladian style that represents stability and strength. Decorative features of the building include use of vermiculation and replete with carvings of the faces of snarling lions and stern, bearded men in each key stone of the original building’s central arches.
Lang’s second commission, a triumphal arch in St Paul’s Cemetery, commemorated British victory in the Crimean War and Halifax’s fallen sons, especially Augustus Frederick Welsford and William B. C. A. Parker. A larger than life twelve ton lion stands atop the Roman triumphal arch. Lang sculpted the lion from Albert County, New Brunswick sandstone. Lang repeated the monument’s lion motif on several later buildings.
Lang also built the present-day Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, which is a three and a half storey, Italianate style building located in the core of downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia. Designed by David Stirling, and built in sandstone, the Art Gallery was built in 1868, modeled after the fifteenth and sixteenth century Italian palazzos built during the Renaissance period. The building is valued today as an excellent example of late nineteenth century Italianate style architecture. The height of the building reduces the buildings proportions, while the triplet composition of the vertical and horizontal divisions and the grouping of the round-arched windows give the building a simple rhythm.
Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia.
For his remaining 15 years Lang operated a brick manufactory in Shubenacadie, initially with Halifax carpenter James Thompson.
Another Lang building, and important Nova Scotia architectural landmark, is Convocation Hall at King's Edgehill School in Windsor, Nova Scotia.
This Gothic Revival building has played an important part in the lives of students at King's Edgehill (as well at the its predessor institutions of King College and King's College School) serving since its construction in 1867 in the purpose that it was designed for by David
Stirling as the campus library. It remains the oldest extant purpose built library in Nova Scotia.
An honorary member of the North British Society from 1858, Lang served as a volunteer in the Chebucto Greys from 1860 to 1865 and as vice-president of the Caledonia Curling Club in 1862.
The Nova Scotia building stones he collected and displayed at the international exhibitions of 1862 (London) and 1865 (Dublin) won him honorary mention at the latter.

Butana plain

Butana Plain is located in the Kassala and Gedaref states in Eastern Sudan. It is a semiarid clay region with mountainous ranges to the south and the west. Its boundaries include the Main Nile, the Blue Nile, and the Atbara River, but there are also several seasonal rivers which intersect, Ba-Salam, Gash, Rahad, and Seitite. Geological characteristics found here are sandy and stony soils, light non-cracking clay, and dark cracking clay; the superficial clays cover over 70% of the plain. Although there are very limited water resources, seasonal surface water wells and a few deep bore wells are present. A tropical continental climate provides rain in the southern section of the plain. Two vegetation zones feature a semi-desert Acacia shrub, short grasslands, and a low woodland savannah.

Hüon und Amande

Hüon und Amande (also known as Oberon or Oberon oder König der Elfen) is a romantic Singspiel in five acts by Friederike Sophie Seyler, based on the poem "Oberon" by Christoph Martin Wieland. It was published in "Flensburg, Schleswig and Leipzig" in 1789 (the same year as Seyler's death), and was dedicated to the actor Friedrich Ludwig Schröder, a long-time friend and collaborator of Seyler and her husband Abel Seyler, the founder of the Seyler theatrical company (see also Seyler family). Seyler's libretto formed the basis of Karl Ludwig Giesecke's libretto for the opera "Oberon", written for Emanuel Schikaneder's troupe and set to music by Paul Wranitzky. As Giesecke did not credit her, he later came under much criticism for plagiarism, although it soon became evident that his work was based on Seyler's libretto. The opera "The Magic Flute", with a libretto by Schikaneder, was to a significant degree based on Giesecke's version of "Oberon" and thus ultimately on Seyler. Seyler's husband had also been a freemason since 1753.
According to Peter Branscombe, "it has long been recognized that Giesecke, the named author of Wranitzky's libretto, deserves little credit for what is largely a plagiarism," concluding that "Giesecke's ""Oberon, König der Elfen" is hardly more than a mild revision of Seyler's book." After the theatrical success of Giesecke's plagiarized version (and also after Seyler's death), Seyler's original was renamed "Oberon" and performed under this title. Giesecke's version of Seyler's Oberon was the first opera performed by Schikaneder's troupe at their new theater, and established a tradition within the company of fairy tale operas that was to culminate later in "The Magic Flute" two years later.

Burton v. United States

Burton v. United States is the name of two appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States by Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS) following his conviction for compensated representation of a party in a proceeding in which the United States was interested: "Burton v. United States", 196 U.S. 283 (1905) and "Burton v. United States", 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud.
On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court reversed his convictions because venue and vicinage could not be proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, on the ground that the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.
Burton was the first defendant convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became the first member of the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute for his role in the Oregon land fraud scandal.
Background.
Rialto Co.'s matter.
In 1872, Congress created the crime of mail fraud. Rev. Stat. § 3929 authorized the United States Postmaster General, "upon evidence satisfactory to him" that mail fraud was being committed, to instruct the post master at the fraudster's local post office to return registered mail addressed to the fraudster to the sender with the word "Fraudulent" written or stamped on the envelope. In 1895, this authority was extended to all mail. Further, Rev. Stat. § 4041 authorized the Postmaster to also bar suspected fraudsters from cashing postal money orders.
The Rialto Grain and Securities Company, whose principal place of business was in St. Louis, Missouri, was under investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud. The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902. State courts were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto. Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in state courts. For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors.
Burton's representation.
That same month—while the two were in Illinois, en route from St. Louis to Chicago—former state judge Thomas B. Harlan, the general counsel of Rialto, arranged to hire Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS), a lawyer, to appear before the Postmaster as counsel for Rialto in connection with these investigations for a monthly salary of $500. When the general counsel returned to St. Louis on November 18, he communicated Burton's offer to Rialto and Rialto accepted. Rialto notified Burton of its acceptance by telegram to him in Washington that same day. 
Burton informed Rialto by mail that he had learned of the two complaints from the Postmaster, arranged for himself to notified of any future complaints, and arranged to represent Rialto in a hearing before the Postmaster before any sanctions would issue. Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.
Rialto paid Burton by monthly checks for the first four months. Burton received the first check on November 22. Burton indorsed and deposited the checks at Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C., which in turn sent the checks to Rialto's bank, the Commonwealth Trust Company in St. Louis, Missouri, for payment. The last $500 was paid in cash to Burton in person, at Rialto's office in St. Louis, on March 26, 1903, after which Burton's representation of Rialto terminated.
Indictment.
A federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri was already investigating the Brooks Brokerage Company, with which Dennis, the President of Rialto, was associated. Witnesses against Burton at the grand jury included Chief Post Office Inspector William E. Cochran, Dennis, and W.B. Mehaney, the Vice President of Rialto. About two weeks before Burton's indictment, the grand jury came into possession of the checks from Rialto to Burton.
Burton was indicted on January 24, 1904, in the Eastern District of Missouri, on nine counts of violating Rev. Stat. § 1782. Section 1782 (enacted 1864) provided, in relevant part:
The first and second counts of the indictment pertained to the receipt of the final cash payment from Rialto with reference to two separate interests of the United States. The third count pertained to receipt of the final cash payment from Mahaney. The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth counts of the indictment pertained to the receipt of the four check for the first four months. 
Burton arguably could not have been arrested at the time of his indictment because Congress was in session. provides that Senators and Representatives "shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same." But, Burton voluntarily surrendered. On January 24, Burton and his wife departed for St. Louis.
Trial and conviction.
Judge Elmer Bragg Adams, sitting as the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, presided over Burton's trial. Former state judge Chester H. Krum appeared as Burton's attorney. Assistant U.S. Attorney Horace Dyer acted as prosecutor.
In his opening statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed to act as general counsel and to allow his name to be placed in Rialto's literature, and that the agreement explicitly provided that Burton would never represent Rialto before any federal agency.
On March 23, the prosecution began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified the letters of complaint received against Rialto. Ernest H. Kastor, of a St. Louis advertising firm, testified that he introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902. Witnesses said that the agreement was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments. Dyer read into evidence the letter from Burton to Rialto.
The prosecution's case continued on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton had attempted to discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton had told him that he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.
The defense case commenced on March 25. The third count of the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, and that he had only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.
After the jury returned deadlocked 11-1, Judge Adams delivered an "Allen" charge. Soon afterwards, the jury returned a verdict that failed to address the third count in the indictment, so the Judge Allen ordered the jury to return to deliberations without reading the verdict. On March 28, 1904, after forty-one total hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Burton on five counts—counts one, two, six, eight, and nine—but acquitted on count three. Burton's convictions would have authorized a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a $50,000 fine. 
Burton asked that the jury be polled, and each stated that the verdict was his own. Burton moved for a new trial. Judge Adams indicated that he would accept a supersedeas bond of $5,000, and Burton was not sentenced. Burton became the first defendant ever convicted under § 1782, more than 40 years after its enactment.
Burton had a right to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, but instead opted for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. On July 2, Judge Adams certified Burton's direct appeal on the grounds that Burton was convicted of an "infamous offense." Burton posted a $10,000 bond. On July 11, Justice Brewer allowed the direct appeal.
"Burton I" (1905).
Before the Supreme Court, on November 30 and December 1, 1904, Burton was represented by (former judge) John Forrest Dillon and (future Solicitor General) Frederick William Lehmann at oral argument, with Harry Hubbard and W.H. Rossington also on the brief. Solicitor General Henry M. Hoyt represented the United States.
On January 16, 1905, the Court overturned Burton's convictions.
Sufficiency of the indictment and the evidence.
Without any discussion of the merits, 5-4, the Court held that the indictment stated offenses under § 1782 and that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have convicted Burton. Justices Harlan, Brown, McKenna, Holmes, and Day were in the majority; Chief Justice Fuller, and Justices Peckham, Brewer, and White, were in dissent.
Venue and vicinage.
Article III provides that: "The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed." The Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides that: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . ."
Burton argued that both constitutional provisions were violated because the crime had not occurred in the Eastern District of Missouri. Justice Peckham, writing for the entire Court except for Justice Harlan in dissent, reversed Burton's convictions on these grounds. The Court held that Burton's negotiation of the check in Washington, D.C. did not constitute conduct by Burton in St. Louis (the site of the drawee bank). In other words, whatever the Washington, D.C. bank did with the check afterwards, it did for itself, not as Burton's agent. "From the time of the delivery of the check by the defendant to the bank it became the owner of the check; it could have torn it up or thrown it in the fire or made any other use or disposition of it which it chose, and no right of defendant would have been infringed." Thus, the Court held that it was error for the trial judge to have submitted the question of the "understanding . . . between the defendant and the bank" to the jury. In support of this argument, the Court cited several of its own precedents concerning negotiable instrument law, as well as cases from the House of Lords and the courts of New York and Massachusetts.
In a single paragraph, the Court rejected the application of the continuing offense doctrine, which had been codified in Rev. Stat. § 731. "This is not a case of the commencement of a crime in one district and its completion in another, so that under the statute the court in either district has jurisdiction. There was no beginning of the offense in Missouri. The payment of the money was in Washington, and there was no commencement of that offense when the officer of the Rialto Company sent the checks from St. Louis to defendant. The latter did not thereby begin an offense in Missouri."
Justice Harlan dissented on this ground. "As between the accused and his client," Harlan argued, "he was not, in any true sense, compensated for the services alleged to have been rendered in violation of the statute, until by payment of the checks by the St. Louis bank he was relieved of all liability to the Riggs National Bank arising from his indorsing the checks to it." Harlan concluded that the majority had "sacrificed substance to mere form," illustrating the Latin maxim "Qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice."
Refused jury instructions.
By the same 8-1 majority, the Court found a separate and independent ground for the reversal of Burton's convictions. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: "instructions were asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I think they have, in the main, been covered by the charge, yet I will give them to you. . . . These are abstract propositions of law, which I give in connection with the charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it. I am willing to give them, inasmuch as they are asked, and they contain general propositions of law."
After the jury returned deadlocked 11-1, the trial judge delivered an "Allen" charge. At this point, the judge refused Burton's request to instruct the jury that the earlier requested instructions stood on the same footing as the other instructions. The Court held that this was reversible error. 
Harlan also dissented from this ground for reversal, arguing that Burton was not substantially prejudiced.
Further, the Court disapproved of the judge's having asked the jury for the proportions of their deadlock (even though he did not ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In "Brasfield v. United States" (1926), citing "Burton", the Court held that such was reversible error, regardless of whether the defendant objected in the trial court.
Retrial.
Burton was reindicted, still in the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905, and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation. The new indictment had eight counts. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged that Burton had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. The counts different only in the interest of the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter. Counts four and five were dismissed before trial. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. Also, also the first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.
While the indictment was pending, Burton was robbed in Chicago and his wallet was recovered in a mail box by postal employees. Before Burton's second trial, the Department of Justice learned that Burton had also collected $14,000 for representing the Chickasaw before the Interior Department: $5,000 of which was paid directly to him, and $9,000 of which was paid to his brother Z.R. Burton.
The trial date was originally set for October 3, and subpoenas to witnesses—many of whom resided in Washington, D.C.—issued on September 12. Judge Willis Van Devanter (a future Supreme Court justice), of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit presided over Burton's second trial. On November 20, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dyer gave the opening statement for the prosecution and Lehmann for the defense. As in the first trial, Lehmann argued that Burton's intent was to represent Dennis (now deceased) in a criminal case.
On November 21, the prosecution introduced the letters, telegrams, and checks into evidence. On November 22, Harland testified that Burton had stated: "I am not going to do anything inconsistent with my duty as a Senator." Mahaney testified to the in-person payment and the destruction of the letters at Burton's request on March 22, 1902. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton represented Rialto before him.
On November 26, 1905, after two hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Burton on the six remaining counts: counts one, two, three, six, seven, and eight. Burton was sentenced on the sixth and seventh counts only (because some of the counts involved the same transactions). Burton was sentenced to six months imprisonment in a county jail and a $2,000 fine on the sixth count and six months imprisonment and a $500 fine on the seventh count. In addition, he was "rendered forever hereafter incapable of holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the Government of the United States."
"Burton II" (1906).
The second time before the Court, on April 3–4, 1906, Burton was again represented by Dillon and Lehmann, plus Bailey P. Waggener, again with Hubbard and Rossington on the brief, plus W. Knox Haynes and W.P. Hackney. All together, Burton was represented by a team of ten lawyers, led by Dillon. Waggener delivered the argument in chief, assisted by Lehmann. Assistant Attorney General (and future judge) Charles Henry Robb represented the United States.
On May 21, 1906, the Supreme Court upheld Burton's convictions. That same day, another of Burton's lawyers, former Senator John Mellen Thurston, filed a petition for rehearing, which operated as a 60 day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter much longer because the Court was set to adjourn until October.
Separation of powers.
Article One provides: "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . . . . Each House may . . . punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member."
Burton argued that § 1782 was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers because the Senate's power to punish its members was exclusive. Burton's brief compared the ban on legislators practicing before executive agencies to a ban on the President lobbying legislators for legislation. The "New York Times" called this "one of the most interesting efforts to get a new meaning out of the Constitution that has appeared for some time." A later article noted that, "decision is especially interesting because of the large array of legal talent in the case and the ingenious argument made by Bailey Wagner [sic of Topeka that the Senate is the judge of the qualifications of its own members . . . ."
The Court unanimously rejected this argument. The Court cited earlier laws prohibiting members of Congress from practicing before the United States Court of Claims and from entering into contracts with the United States. Further, the Court noted that "he proper discharge of those duties does not require a Senator to appear before an executive Department in order to enforce his particular views, or the views of others, in respect of matters committed to that Department for determination."
Burton also argued that that the provision rendering those convicted under § 1782 "incapable of holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the Government of the United States" unconstitutionally infringed on the Qualifications Clause. The Court dodged this question by holding that the provision would not bar a convicted defendant from serving in the Senate because Senators (at the time) were elected by the state legislatures.
Interests of the United States.
Burton next argued that the indictment was insufficient because the Postmaster's decision to return mail addressed to suspected fraudsters back to senders and to bar suspected fraudsters from cashing money orders was not a "proceeding . . . controversy. . . or other matter or thing in which the United States is . . . directly or indirectly interested." The Court rejected this argument, 6-3. Although the Court admitted that the United States had no pecuniary interest in the proceeding, it argued:
Justice Brewer, joined by Justices White and Peckham dissented on this point. They argued that the statute applied only to the pecuniary interests of the United States. These justices were among the four (in addition to Chief Justice Fuller) who would have held the indictment insufficient in "Burton I", presumably for this reason. The dissenters argued that the majority's interpretation would find the United States interested in any administrative proceeding, thus rendering the statutory words "before any Department, court martial, bureau, officer, or any civil, military, or naval commission whatever" to be mere surplussage. Further, the dissent cited the Reconstruction Era legislative history pointing towards a narrower interpretation.
Sufficiency of the evidence.
Burton next argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Reviewing the evidence, the Court rejected this argument.
Separate offenses of agreeing and receiving.
Section 1782 provided that "No Senator . . . shall receive or agree to receive any compensation . . . ." Burton argued that he could not simultaneously be charged with separate offenses for agreeing to receive compensation and actually receiving compensation for the same transaction. The Court rejected this argument. The Court stated that Burton's interpretation "does violence to statute's words," emphasizing the word "or."
Justice McKenna disagreed with this holding. Thus, he concurred only in the affirmance of the charges alleging receipt, not the charges alleging agreement.
Double jeopardy.
Burton next argued that his prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal on the third count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial. The Court rejected this argument. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.
Venue and vicinage.
Finally, Burton argued that the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an argument that the Court had accepted in "Burton I"). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III does not require the physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.
Aftermath.
Burton remained a Senator while each of his appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate. However, Burton did appear in the Senate after his conviction. On April 6, 1904, Burton appeared to push for appropriations for the acquisition of land in the Adirondacks and Catskills. On January 22, 1906, Burton appeared in the Senate chamber again, for 30 seconds, in order to be eligible for $1,000 in travel reimbursements from the federal government.
Burton's term was due to expire on March 4, 1907. After his conviction was finally affirmed, a resolution to expel Burton from the Senate was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on May 22, 1906. Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.
Burton served five months of his six-month sentence in the Iron County Jail in Ironton, Missouri. In March 1907, he returned to Abilene.
Role of President Roosevelt.
Contemporary rumor held that Burton's indictment had been ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt. Although Joseph W. Folk, the Circuit Attorney for the City of St. Louis (and future Governor of Missouri), had recently visited with the President and Attorney General, the "New York Times" reported that "there was not a word in either of those interviews about the Burton case."
Burton himself alleged that Roosevelt had orchestrated his prosecution in March 23, 1907 speech in Abilene, Kansas after his release from prison. Burton pointed out that his was the first prosecution under § 1782 and that numerous other public officials before him had potentially violated it, under the interpretation that prevailed in the Supreme Court.
Burton and Roosevelt had a complicated history. Burton, as a leader at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.
Earlier that year, while accompanying Roosevelt on a visit to Kansas, Burton told Roosevelt about his project to create a reproduction of Jerusalem at the time of Christ's birth for the St. Louis World's Fair. Roosevelt gave Burton a letter praising the exhibit, which Burton in turn published by facsimile in a magazine advertisement for the sale of stock in the exhibit. The White House received a letter from the magazine inquiring into the authenticity of the letter on the same day that Mulvane returned for a second meeting to press Smith's appointment. Roosevelt was enraged, demanded the return of the letter, and declared that "from now on Burton would be considered politically a Democratic Senator, as far as patronage is concerned." "The President's indignation knew no bounds. He had never been so grossly and humiliatingly deceived during his incumbency in office."
Burton was also in a "long standing feud" with Fourth Assistant Postmaster (and future Senator) Joseph L. Bristow, whom Burton had lobbied Roosevelt (and his predecessor, William McKinley) to replace. Roosevelt refused to remove Bristow except for cause, and in any case refused to appoint one of Burton's friends to replace him.
Another issue with which Burton clashed with Roosevelt was reciprocity with Cuba. Burton cited this issue in his Abilene speech. In order to force concessions from Roosevelt, Burton had joined with Senators from beet sugar states. Although Burton publicly spoke against a treaty with Cuba, he repeatedly privately informed Roosevelt that he would support the ratification of the treaty. According to the "New York Times", "he history of Burton's manoeuvres at this time will never be fully told."

Amnios (biology)

The amnios is a pouch in which an embryo develops. It is a defining characteristic of amniotes. The amnios is adjacent to the epidermis, formed by the ectoderm of the fetus, and is extremely elastic.
In elephants, "The amnios is continued from the base of the umbilical cord upon the allantois, which is of considerable size, and is so interposed between the chorion and amnios, as to prevent any part of the amnios attaining the inner surface of the placenta. The amnios consists of two layers:one is the granular layer, continued upon the inner or foetal surface of the allantois, and thence upon the umbilical cord; the other is the smooth outer layer, continued upon the outer or chorional surface of the allantois, and thence upon the inner surface of the chorion."

<doc id="36683952" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36683952" title="Soldier-Talk">
Soldier-Talk

Soldier-Talk is the third album by the experimental rock band The Red Crayola, released in 1979 through Radar Records. It was the first release under the name Red Crayola in over ten years. By this time, Thompson had moved the project to London and expanded the band for this album to include Lora Logic of X-Ray Spex and Essential Logic and all the members of Pere Ubu.
Background.
Since the release of "God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It", Steve Cunningham had left the project to peruse his own musical ambitions and had been replaced by Jesse Chamberlain. In 1978, this incarnation of the band was touring regularly and had been signed to Radar Records. While in Europe Thompson met Pere Ubu, who were touring in support of "The Modern Dance", and struck up a friendship.
Composition.
Despite the presence of Pere Ubu, the music is a close continuation of the sound previously established by Red Crayola. "Soldier-Talk" was conceived as a concept album dealing with the issues of militarism and Soviet communism.
Chamberlain wanted to veer the music towards a more pop oriented direction while Thompson opted to keep the sound experimental. As Thompson explained, "there wasn't much for him to do, in a way, I think he wanted to say what he felt about the record, and he wanted it closer in the direction of pop, because Jesse, that's always been one of his gifts, and I was determined to make the record work, and thought that it could, and should, and working with Geoff Travis, using his insights into the way music works, there was no other way it could be…" The conflict of interest caused a strain on their musical partnership although they later worked again on another record in a similar vein, "Three Songs on a Trip to America", the cover of which referenced "Soldier Talk".
Aftermath.
Around the release of the album, Mayo Thompson became an active producer for many of the bands on the Rough Trade roster, including Stiff Little Fingers, The Fall and The Raincoats. He also became a member Pere Ubu, filling the spot left after Tom Herman's departure, and recorded "The Art of Walking' and Song of the Bailing Man with the group.
Reception.
Bassist Mike Watt named "Soldier-Talk" as being one of his favorite rock albums. Thom Jurek of allmusic declared it "among the loopiest of the Red Krayola's offerings" and representative of "post-punk's more musically adventurous side." He gave the album three out of five stars, describing the songs as being independently compelling and engaging. Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork Media gave the album 5.3 out of 10 and was critical towards the overall abrasiveness of the music, writing "It's a consistently interesting album-- there's something trying to get your attention at every moment, but in the manner of a beloved little sibling who won't stop poking you." He concluded that the record is best suited for those who find Gang of Four's "Entertainment!" too subdued.

It was renamed Carronbridge Station on 1 January 1871, and closed to regular passenger traffic on 7 December 1853. The line remains in regular use by passenger traffic.
Carronbridge was opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway, which then became part of the Glasgow and South Western Railway; in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping, passing on to the Scottish Region of British Railways following the 1948 nationalisation of the railways. It was closed by the British Railways Board in 1953. The station lay a significant distance from the village of Carronbridge, however it also served a large rural area of scattered farms and cottages.
The 1898 OS map shows several freight sidings, a goods shed and a signal box at Carronbridge.
Micro-history.
The Durisdeer Parish War Memorial is located on the roadside, close to the entrance to the old station.

Vic Cathedral (, ), officially the Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle (, ) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Vic, Catalonia, Spain. It is the seat of the Diocese of Vic.
It has a mix of Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque and Neoclassic styles.
A cathedral in Vic appears documented in the year 516, though it was destroyed during an Arab raid in 717-718. It was rebuilt in 886 when the count Wilfred the Hairy repopulated the area. It was remodeled by Abat Oliba in the 11th century in Romanesque style, building the same bell tower and crypt which are still standing nowadays. The crypt still has the preRomanesque capitals. The cloister dates from the 14th century and it’s build in Gothic style, while some chapels were built later in Baroque style.
Before 1787, the cathedral shared its importance with Church of Santa Maria la Rodona. It was located nearby the nowadays cathedral, but finally it was demolished to enlarge the one standing nowadays. With the reforms, the building was also rebuilt in neoclassic style, except the parts said before. However, most of the older pieces of cathedral, in Romanesque and Gothic style, were kept and can still be seen in Vic Episcopal Museum. The cathedral was damaged during the Spanish Civil War, and later it was restored.
The historic Catalan character Abat Oliba is buried inside the cathedral. The most relevant parts of the cathedral can be said to be the pre-Romanesque capitals, the Romanesque bell tower, crypt and rosette; and the Gothic cloister.

Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell

Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell is an American stand up comedy television series that premiered on FX on August 9, 2012, starring comedian W. Kamau Bell. On stage, Bell did mostly observational comedy on recent news stories and current events. After an opening PowerPoint monologue, the program usually cuts to a segment filmed outside of the studio. Additionally, since all of the show's writers were stand-up comedians, many often appear as correspondents who perform monologues. Later at the end of the program, Bell interviews a celebrity guest. In order to ensure the show's topicality, most of the show was taped on the day that it was broadcast. In the first episode, Bell interviewed Chris Rock, who was also an executive producer of the show.
It was announced on November 13, 2013, that "Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell" had been canceled, and that the final episode would be broadcast the next day.
Production.
On September 18, 2012, FX ordered an additional seven episodes of "Totally Biased" that premiered on October 11, 2012 at 11:30 PM ET. Episode 12 ended up airing at 12:00 AM ET on November 16, 2012 because "Brand X with Russell Brand" had been extended to an hour. On November 27, FX announced the series would have an additional 13 episodes in the first season beginning on January 17, 2013. After a short break during the 2013 portion of season 1, episodes resumed on May 9, 2013 and continued until the season 1 finale on June 20, 2013. With the launch of FXX, the show would air daily at 11:00 PM ET and began its second season on September 4, 2013.
Reception.
The premiere episode received mixed reviews. "The A.V. Club" gave it a B+ and called it "a much better version of "Chocolate News", which drops the sketch comedy bent for more explicit social commentary that blends "The Daily Show" with what Russell Brand wishes he could get on "Brand X"." The "Los Angeles Times" also compared Bell and the show favorably to "Brand X", saying that "there is a voluble sweetness to his manner that should prove a tonally better companion" to preceding programs. "The San Francisco Chronicle" applauded the shows edginess, saying that "it makes "The Daily Show" look like something your dad watches." "Newsday" gave the show a B- and was more critical saying that "Rock may want to light a fire under this act sooner than later." "The A.V. Club" reviewed the first cycle of season one giving it a B, stating that it has "positive progress to build on going forward. It’s certainly in better shape than "Brand X", especially when it just lets Bell do his thing in the opening segment. But the longevity of the show will depend on the star finding a way to shape the out-of-studio segments into something more compelling and growing as an interviewer."

Random Encounters

"For the video game mechanic, see random encounter."
Random Encounters is an American musical web series co-created by AJ Pinkerton and Peter Srinivasan. The series' first official short, "A Pikachu Song", premiered on YouTube on June 7, 2011. The series is currently partnered with Maker Studios' Game Station, though previously existed as part of IGN Entertainment's network.
Each short consists of an original musical number (often performed by live-action actors in cosplay) recreating scenes or starring characters from a popular video game series (such as The Legend of Zelda or Pokémon). The series was first inspired in 2010 when the creators' Sonic the Hedgehog musical parody won the grand prize in an international video competition hosted by Sega.
Since launching their YouTube series, AJ and Peter have taken their songs to various festivals and conventions to perform live.
History.
"Random Encounters" was initially conceived during a Sega-sponsored contest, for which Pinkerton co-developed the winning entry and his first video game parody song, "Needlemouse: The Musical". The Needlemouse song was requested by Sega to be performed live at their 2011 Sonic Boom community event, where Pinkerton and Srinivasan first recognized the demand for their product and began development on a series of popular games as musical numbers.
Style.
Unlike some gaming series, Random Encounters consistently caters to both children and adults. Songs are written to be comedically self-censored, such as disregarding the rhyming scheme to avoid an obvious curse word. Shorts based on mature content, such as Assassin's Creed or Dead Space, present light-hearted versions of the characters, rather than their colder in-game incarnations.
Musical styles for each short vary, but typically consist of extremely bouncy rhythms and quick tempos. Some songs borrow heavily from other sources, such as Disney numbers or in-game themes. The series' derives much of its humor from each song's lyrics, which often make reference to in-game events, pop culture or internet memes.
Some songs feature animation, generally designed to appear more cartoonish and kawaii than lifelike.
Corporate relationships.
Sega.
After "Needlemouse: The Musical" won top honors in their Sonic Birthday contest, Sega arranged to have the Random Encounters team perform an alternate version at Sonic Boom 2011, this time highlighting the Modern Sonic/Classic Sonic chemistry from Sonic Generations. Nine months later, Random Encounters co-produced a musical game trailer for the fictitious title "Sega Bass Fishing of the Dead" as part of Sega's online April Fools' prank. Sega approached the Random Encounters team a third time with the release of Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure, which became the focus of the first sponsored Encounter.
In August 2012, the Random Encounters Facebook page confirmed their involvement with Sega on a Super Monkey Ball video.
Nintendo.
In 2013, Random Encounters joined the Nintendo Ambassador program as part of the Wii U Challenge. Their first project as a brand ambassador, for the Challenge, was a musical promoting .

MPD Psycho (miniseries)

MPD Psycho (full title Multiple Personality Detective Psycho - Kazuhiko Amamiya Returns) is a 2000 Japanese six-part horror crime television miniseries, based on the manga of the same name and directed by Takashi Miike. It originally aired on 2 May 2000. It has a surrealist bent, and, according to Jim Harper, the author of "Flowers from Hell", "bears little similarity to the average made-for-TV detective thriller".
The plot is similar to the beginning of the manga series but does not relate to the incidents of Lucy Monostone and the Gakuso Company. Yosuke Kobayashi, a detective assigned to a homicide unit, saw his wife killed by a serial killer, Shinji Nishizono. From the shock of the incident, he suffers from multiple personality disorder and becomes Kazuhiko Amamiya. Soon after, he manages to hunt down and kill his wife's murderer. Now a series of murders have started, and the suspect is claiming to be Shinji Nishizono.
Background.
The series contains several visual distortions which, mistaken by some to be censorship, are of non-explicit images and have been seen instead as a jab against Japanese censorship.
Critical reception.
DVD Talk called it a "difficult yet fascinating" series that "wraps you up in its nightmarish dreamscapes", writing, "its unending complications will put off many, but for fans of Miike's catalogue or other similarly intentionally dense, style-over-substance material, there's enough here to delight and horrify".
Home video.
The series was first released on DVD by Pony Canyon in Japan.
It was subsequently released on DVD in Australia in 2008 by Siren Visual Entertainment.

Nicola Ferrari (born 14 September 1989) is an Italian footballer who plays for Aprilia.
Biography.
Sassuolo.
Born in Magreta, Formigine, Emilia–Romagna, Ferrari started his professional career with U.S. Sassuolo Calcio. He played for Sassuolo's reserve from ca. March 2006 and spent 1½ seasons for Sampdoria's reserve in Campionato Nazionale Primavera from January 2008.
Before he left Sassuolo, Ferrari made his professional debut on 16 December 2007 and also played the next two game. He earned a call-up to represent Serie C1/A against Serie C1/B, which the team won the tournament.
N.Ferari scored 4 goals in 7 games for Sampdoria reserve in 2007–08 season, as joint-third scorer of the team (along with Guido Marilungo and Stefano Scappini), behind Salvatore Foti (8 goals in half season) and Moussa Diarra (5 goals). However he did not play any game in the playoff (but Gabriel Ferrari did) except the final. N.Ferrari was the second top-scorer of Sampdoria reserve in 2008–09 season, behind Marilungo. That season Sampdoria was eliminated in the postseason playoffs in the round 16 (first round) by Palermo. The teams draw 3–3 in aggregate but Palermo had more away goal. Ferrari scored once in these three goals. Ferrari also scored 4 goals for the runner-up of 2009 Torneo di Viareggio.
Lega Pro clubs.
Since 2009 Ferrari was farmed to Lega Pro clubs in co-ownership deal, namely Viareggio (swap with Alessio Cristiani), Fano (for €500; €10,000 bought back), South Tyrol (for €500), Foligno and Aprilia.

SPARC T-Series

The Oracle SPARC T-Series is a range of RISC processors and UNIX server computers developed by Oracle Corporation and based on SPARC V9 architecture. The first generation T-Series processor, the UltraSPARC T1 and servers were developed by Sun Microsystems, and announced in December 2005. It was only later when the term T-Series was used to refer to this family of processors. For example The Register used the it in 2009.
Sun Microsystems did not officially use the term T-Series in the product documentation for the UltraSPARC T1, T2, and T2 Plus processors or servers. However, those products preceded the SPARC T3 based T-Series products which were introduced in 2010 after the completion of Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems. Later Oracle introduced the SPARC T4 processor and servers in September of 2011, which are considered fourth generation implementation of the T-Series.
The 5th generation T5 processors and servers were launch in March, 2013.
Pre Oracle SPARC T-Series era.
The SPARC T3 servers superseded Sun Microsystems' Sun Fire and SPARC Enterprise product lines that were based on earlier generations of the CMT (Chip Multithreading) technology acquired from Sun Microsystems. The UltraSPARC T1 based Sun Fire T2000 and T1000 servers were launched in December 2005 and in early 2006, respectively. They were later rebranded to match the name of the UltraSPARC T2 and T2 Plus based Sun SPARC Enterprise T5**0 servers.
SPARC T3 processor based models.
In September 2010, Oracle announced a range of SPARC T3 processor based servers. These are branded as the "SPARC T3" series, the "SPARC Enterprise" brand being dropped.
The SPARC T3 series servers included the T3-1B which was a blade server module that fits into the Sun Blade 6000 system. All other T3 based servers are rack mounted systems. Subsequent T-Series server generations also include also a blade server in the same Sun Blade 6000 form factor.
SPARC T4 processor based models.
On September 26, 2011, Oracle announced a range of SPARC T4-based servers.
These systems use the same chassis already known from the T3 based systems. Their main features are very similar, with the exception of:
SPARC T5 processor based models.
On March 26, 2013, Oracle announced refreshed SPARC servers based on the new SPARC T5 microprocessor, which the company claims is "the world's fastest".
There are differences in SPARC T5 range of servers compared to previous generations of SPARC T-series: the single socket rackmount server design was deprecated, while the new eight socket rackmount server was introduced.
Partitioning and virtualization.
SPARC T-series servers partition the system using Logical Domains. Additional virtualization is provided by Oracle Solaris Zones (aka Solaris Containers) to create isolated virtual servers within a single operating system instance. Logical Domains and Solaris Zones can be used together to increase server utilization.

Elizaveta Karamihailova

Elisabeth Ivanova Kara-Michailova (), alternatively Elisabeth Karamichailova was a Bulgarian physicist of English origin. She was among the handful of female nuclear physics pioneers at the beginning of the 20th century, established the first practical courses of particle physics in Bulgaria and was the first woman to hold a professorial title in the country.
Early life.
Elisabeth Karamichailova was born in 1897 in Vienna, to Ivan Mikhaylov and Mary Slade. Both her parents had studied at the University of Vienna - Ivan, born in Shumen, was studying medicine, while Mary, a native of Minster Lovell in Oxfordshire, studied music. After her father graduated in 1907, the family remained in Vienna for two years before moving to Bulgaria in 1909 where they acquired a spacious house in central Sofia. 
Karamichailova grew up in both an artistic and scientific environment. Her father turned the upper floor of his house into a Red Cross Hospital where he treated his patients without requiring payment. She enrolled in the Sofia Girls' College and graduated there in 1917, after which she departed to study at the University of Vienna.
Studies in radioactivity.
In 1922 Karamichailova graduated as a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. She wrote her thesis, entitled "About Electric Figures on Different Materials, Especially On Crystals" under the direction of Karl Przibram. Karamichailova continued her work at the Institute for Radium Studies afterwards, becoming particularly interested in radioluminescence. She cooperated with Marietta Blau in the study of polonium, and later researched methods for neutron bombardment of thorium. Karamichailova simultaneously attended courses in electronic and radio engineering at the Vienna Polytechnic. In the autumn of 1923 she returned briefly to Bulgaria and worked as a "guest fellow" at the Physics Institute of Sofia University. Soon Karamichailova went back to Vienna and began her work on the transmutation of light elements under alpha radiation at the Institute of Radium Studies. In 1931, Karamichailova and Marietta Blau observed a specific type of previously unknown radiation emitted from polonium, which would later be confirmed by James Chadwick as neutron radiation, leading to his discovery of neutrons.
In 1933 the position of "research assistant", under which she worked in Vienna, was terminated. Karamichailova had to continue her research without tuition until 1935, when she obtained a 3-year Alfred Yarrow Research Fellowship from Girton College, Cambridge. She was subsequently employed at the Cavendish Laboratory. In December 1937, she applied for a position as a docent in Experimental Physics at Sofia University. Karamichailova managed to extend her scholarship by 10 months, and finally returned to Bulgaria in 1939, where she was appointed as a docent of Experimental Atomistics with Radioactivity at SU. She set up an atomic physics course, introducing the latest knowledge from her studies in Austria and England and some of her equipment. The outbreak of World War II halted any further expansion of nuclear research activities. 
Her studies now involved cosmic rays as well. Karamichailova used photographic plates to continue her work in this field, which she had collaborated on with Marietta Blau. She attempted to continue the study of multiple ionization, but this was impossible without the sophisticated equipment she had access to while in England. When Karamichailova began her work in Sofia in 1940, she only had a microscope and a dark room.
Later life.
After the left-wing uprising in 1944, the newly established far-left authorities in Bulgaria labeled Karamichailova as "unreliable" due to her anti-communist views and prohibited her from going abroad. She continued her work in the field of radioactivity in Bulgaria, initially at Sofia University and later, at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, where she received the title of "professor". Karamichailova died of cancer in 1968, most likely from long-term radiation exposure.

Martin Petzold (born 1955) is a German classical tenor who performs in opera and in concert. A former member of the Thomanerchor, he is particularly known for the part of the Evangelist in oratorios and Passions of Johann Sebastian Bach.
Career.
Petzold was born in Leipzig, the son of the theologian Ernst Petzold. He received his first musical education as a member of the Thomanerchor, where he was a member from 1965 to 1974, at the same time as Georg Christoph Biller. His father, his brother and later his son Jakob were also choir members.
As Petzold initially refused to join the army, the East German authorities denied him the right to study music. He served for 18 months and then studied voice from 1979 to 1985 at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig with Eva Schubert and Bernd Siegfried Weber. He wanted to sing in an opera chorus, but while still a student was engaged as a soloist in Halberstadt and Altenburg. In 1985 he became a member of the Landestheater Halle. He appeared regularly at the Leipzig Opera from 1986, and has been a permanent member of the ensemble since 1988. He has sung the parts of David in Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg", Pedrillo in Mozart's "Die Entführung aus dem Serail", Toni in Henze's "Elegie für junge Liebende", Flaut in "Ein Sommernachtstraum" and Iwan in Shostakovich's "Die Nase", among others.
In concert, Petzold has collaborated with major orchestras and choirs, such as the Thomanerchor, the Dresdner Kreuzchor, the Monteverdi-Chor Hamburg, the Gewandhausorchester, the MDR Symphony Orchestra and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra. A particular focus of his work is works by Johann Sebastian Bach; he has sung the part of the Evangelist in his "Christmas Oratorio" and "Passions", conducted by Biller, Peter Schreier, Kurt Masur, Roderich Kreile, Rolf Schweizer and David Timm. Petzold also works for the preservation of German folk songs.
In teaching, Martin Petzold has worked since 2002 as a lecturer at international master classes and is also a vocal coach of the Thomanerchor. In 2001, Martin Petzold was appointed Kammersänger. 
For the Carus-Verlag, Petzold has edited a facsimile edition of the seven volumes of libretti of works by Bach which were published between 1724 and 1749, including the "Christmas Oratorio". The book was awarded the Deutscher Musikeditions-Preis in the facsimile category in 2001.

Milnesium tardigradum

Milnesium tardigradum is a cosmopolitan species of tardigrade that can be found in a diverse range of environments. The M. tardigradum has even been found in the sea around Antarctica.
"M. tardigradum" was described by Doyère in 1840. The M. Tardigradium contains unidentified osmolytes which could potentially provide important information in the process of cryptobiosis.
Description.
Morphology.
The "M. tardigradum" has a symmetrical body with a total of eight legs. The "M. tardigradum" utilize claws, a distinctive feature for this tardigrade species. The total length of the body varies, with some measuring up to 0.7 millimeters in length.
"M. tardigradum" has been found to have a high level of radioresistance. In 2007, individuals of two tardigrade species, "Richtersius coronifer" and "M. tardigradum", were subject to the radiation, near-vacuum and near-absolute zero conditions of outer space as part of the European Space Agency's Biopan-6 experiment. Three specimens of "M. tardigradum" survived. The "M. tardigradum" is able to cope with high amounts of environmental stress by initiating cryptobiosis. It is found that during this state, the internal organic clock of the "M. tardigradum" halts, thus the cryptobiotic state does not contribute to the aging process.
Nutrition.
The "M. tardigradum" is an omnivorous predator. It typically feeds on other small organisms such as algae, rotifers, and nematodes. There have also been recorded cases of the "M. tardigradum" feeding on other smaller tardigrades.
Evolution.
The "M. tardigradum" has been phylogenetically linked to anthropods. Although the extent of the relationship is still debated, there is evidence that tardigrades and arthropods have a close evolutionary history.
Habitat.
The biogeopgraphical distribution of the "M. tardigradum" is large. The species occupies mostly aquatic environments such as marine, coastal and terrestrial areas. The exact distribution of the "M. tardigradum" is difficult to analyze due to the difficulty in taxonomy and the lack of sufficient data.
Reproduction and development.
The "M. tardigradum" reproduces both sexually and through parthenogenisis. The exact mating behavior of tardigrades are difficult to reproduce under artificial conditions, hence the frequency and time of reproduction is not fully understood. It is unknown if and when there is a mating season for the "M. tardigradum".
Females lay up to twelve eggs which hatch after several days (around five to sixteen days). The development of the newly hatched larvae is marked by various molting stages, rather than metamorphisis. The time frame of these molting stages vary from each tardigrade as it is dependent on the nutrition of the specific individual. Once the molting stages are complete, the larva tardigrade attempts to find an ideal location to initiate ecdysis. Some eggs may left in the discarded exuvia. Tardigrades have been shown to respond to different temperature changes at different developmental stages. Specifically, the younger the egg the less likely it is to survive extreme environments. However, not too long after development, tardigrades will demonstrate a remarkable ability to withstand these conditions. In order to survive such conditions, tardigrades need time to develop important cellular structures and repair mechanisms.

In the Kingdom of Oil and Millions

In the kingdom of oil and millions () – is an art film of 1916, shot by film-director Boris Svetlov basing on the motifs of I.Musabeyov’s narrative of the same name. It is considered the first art film in the history of Azerbaijan.
Plot.
Baku in the beginning of the 20th century, everyday life of Baku millionaires and life of workers, who earned their living with hard work in oilfields are shown in the film. Events in the film are unrolled against the background of Jalil’s destiny (performed by V.A.Lenin). Poor Jalil, who grew rich accidentally and became a rich oilman, became friends with Lutfali bey (performed by Huseyn Arablinski) - millionaire and oil magnate. Friendship with this person led Jalil not only to bankruptcy, but also to his total abolition. Unpreparedness of the poor man, who reached up to bourgeois life of the millionaire, is ended tragically.

Bad Pharma

Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients is a book by British physician and academic Ben Goldacre about the pharmaceutical industry, its relationship with the medical profession, and the extent to which it controls academic research into its own products. The book was published in September 2012 in the UK by the Fourth Estate imprint of HarperCollins, and in February 2013 in the United States by Faber and Faber.
Goldacre argues in the book that "the whole edifice of medicine is broken," because the evidence on which it is based is systematically distorted by the pharmaceutical industry. He writes that the industry finances most of the clinical trials into its own products, that it routinely withholds negative data, that trials are often conducted on small groups of unrepresentative subjects, that it funds much of doctors' continuing education, and that apparently independent academic papers may be planned and even ghostwritten by pharmaceutical companies or their contractors, without disclosure. Goldacre calls the situation a "murderous disaster," and makes suggestions for action by patients' groups, physicians, academics and the industry itself.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the trade association in the UK for pharmaceutical companies, issued a statement arguing that the examples the book offers are historical, that the concerns have been addressed, that the industry is among the most regulated in the world, and that it discloses all data in accordance with international standards.
In January 2013 Goldacre joined the Cochrane Collaboration, "British Medical Journal" and others in setting up AllTrials, a campaign calling for the results of all past and current clinical trials to be reported. The British House of Commons Public Accounts Committee expressed concern in January 2014 that drug companies were still only publishing around 50 percent of clinical-trial results.
Author.
After graduating in 1995 with a first-class honours degree in medicine from Magdalen College, Oxford, Goldacre obtained an MA in philosophy from King's College London, then undertook clinical training at UCL Medical School, qualifying as a medical doctor in 2000 and as a psychiatrist in 2005. As of 2014 he was Wellcome Research Fellow in Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Goldacre is known for his "Bad Science" column in the "Guardian", which he has written since 2003, and for his first book, "Bad Science" (2008). This unpicked the claims of several forms of alternative medicine, and criticized certain physicians and the media for a lack of critical thinking. It also looked at the MMR vaccine controversy, AIDS denialism, the placebo effect and the misuse of statistics. Goldacre was recognized in June 2013 by "Health Service Journal" as having done "more than any other single individual to shine a light on how science and research gets distorted by the media, politicians, quacks, PR and the pharmaceutical industry."
Synopsis.
Introduction.
Goldacre writes in the introduction of "Bad Pharma" that the book aims to defend the following paragraph:
Drugs are tested by the people who manufacture them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, we have no idea what the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all. These are ongoing problems, and although people have claimed to fix many of them, for the most part they have failed; so all these problems persist, but worse than ever, because now people can pretend that everything is fine after all.
Chapter 1: "Missing Data".
In "Missing Data," Goldacre argues that the clinical trials undertaken by drug companies routinely reach conclusions favourable to the company. For example, in 2007 researchers studied every published trial on statins, drugs prescribed to reduce cholesterol levels. In the 192 trials they looked at, industry-funded trials were 20 times more likely to produce results that favoured the drug.
He writes that these positive results are achieved in a number of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected in a way that will make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have no idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.
An example he gives of the difficulty of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. "Bad Pharma" charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.
Chapter 2: "Where Do New Drugs Come From?".
In the second chapter, the book describes the process as new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 (first-in-man study), phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 participants are referred to as volunteers, but in the US are paid $200–$400 per day, and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year, earning potential becomes the main reason for participation. Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs). The rate of growth for clinical trials in India is 20 percent a year, in Argentina 27 percent, and in China 47 percent, while trials in the UK have fallen by 10 percent a year and in the US by six percent.
The shift to outsourcing raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, the meaning of informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, the extent to which corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also raises the question of whether the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.
There have also been cases of available treatment being withheld during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that was known to be effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 children died, divided almost equally between the two groups. He also writes that the participants were not told that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available in the next-door building from Médecins Sans Frontières.
Chapter 3: "Bad Regulators".
Chapter three describes the concept of "regulatory capture," whereby a regulator – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States – ends up advancing the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public. Goldacres writes that this happens for a number of reasons, including the revolving door of employees between the regulator and the companies, and the fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common. The chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval, and the difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from the market once they have been approved. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.
Chapter 4: "Bad Trials".
"Bad Trials" examines the ways in which clinical trials can be flawed. Goldacre writes that this happens by design and by analysis, and that it has the effect of maximizing a drug's benefits and minimizing harm.
There have been instances of fraud, though he says these are rare. More common are what he calls the "wily tricks, close calls, and elegant mischief at the margins of acceptability."
These include testing drugs on unrepresentative, "freakishly ideal" patients; comparing new drugs to something known to be ineffective, or effective at a different dose or if used differently; conducting trials that are too short or too small; and stopping trials early or late. It also includes measuring uninformative outcomes; packaging the data so that it is misleading; ignoring patients who drop out (i.e. using per-protocol analysis, where only patients who complete the trial are counted in the final results, rather than intention-to-treat analysis, where everyone who starts the trial is counted); changing the main outcome of the trial once it has finished; producing subgroup analyses that show apparently positive outcomes for certain tightly defined groups (such as Chinese men between the ages of 56 and 71), thereby hiding an overall negative outcome; and conducting "seeding trials," where the objective is to persuade physicians to use the drug.
Another criticism is that outcomes are presented in terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will have a heart attack within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.
Chapter 5: "Bigger, Simpler Trials".
In chapter five Goldacre suggests using the General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials to determine the most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign their patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind – patients would know which statin they had been prescribed – but Goldacre writes that they would be unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable to the extent that it could affect their health.
Chapter Six: "Marketing".
In the final chapter, Goldacre looks at how doctors are persuaded to prescribe "me-too drugs," brand-name drugs that are no more effective than significantly cheaper off-patent ones. He cites as examples the statins atorvastatin (Lipitor, made by Pfizer) and simvastatin (Zocor), which he writes seem to be equally effective, or at least there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Simvastatin came off patent several years ago, yet there are still three million prescriptions a year in the UK for atorvastatin, costing the National Health Service (NHS) an annual £165 million extra.
He addresses the issue of medicalization of certain conditions (or, as he argues, of personhood), whereby pharmaceutical companies "widen the boundaries of diagnosis" before offering solutions. Female sexual dysfunction was highlighted in 1999 by a study published in the "Journal of the American Medical Association", which alleged that 43 percent of women were suffering from it. After the article appeared, the "New York Times" wrote that two of its three authors had worked as consultants for Pfizer, which at the time was preparing to launch UK-414,495, known as female Viagra. The journal's editor said that the failure to disclose the relationship with Pfizer was the journal's mistake.
The chapter also examines celebrity endorsement of certain drugs, the extent to which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed. It discusses how PR firms promote stories from patients who complain in the media that certain drugs are not made available by the funder, which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two breast-cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab (Herceptin) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the "Guardian" that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.
The chapter also covers the influence of drug reps, how ghostwriters are employed by the drug companies to write papers for academics to publish, how independent the academic journals really are, how the drug companies finance doctors' continuing education, and how patients' groups are often funded by industry.
Afterword: "Better Data".
In the afterword and throughout the book, Goldacre makes suggestions for action by doctors, medical students, patients, patient groups and the industry. He advises doctors, nurses and managers to stop seeing drug reps, to ban them from clinics, hospitals and medical schools, to declare online and in waiting rooms all gifts and hospitality received from the industry, and to remove all drug company promotional material from offices and waiting rooms. (He praises the website of the American Medical Student Association – www.amsascorecard.org – which ranks institutions according to their conflict-of-interest policies, writing that it makes him "feel weepy.") He also suggests that regulations be introduced to prevent pharmacists from sharing doctors' prescribing records with drug reps.
He asks academics to lobby their universities and academic societies to forbid academics from being involved in ghostwriting, and to lobby for "film credit" contributions at the end of every academic paper, listing everyone involved, including who initiated the idea of publishing the paper. He also asks for full disclosure of all past clinical trial results, and a list of academic papers that were, as he puts it, "rigged" by industry, so that they can be retracted or annotated. He asks drug company employees to become whistleblowers, either by writing an anonymous blog, or by contacting him.
He advises patients to ask their doctors whether they accept drug-company hospitality or sponsorship, and if so to post details in their waiting rooms, and to make clear whether it is acceptable to the patient for the doctor to discuss his or her medical history with drug reps. Patients who are invited to take part in a trial are advised to ask, among other things, for a written guarantee that the trial has been publicly registered, and that the main outcome of the trial will be published within a year of its completion. He advises patient groups to write to drug companies with the following: "We are living with this disease; is there anything at all that you're withholding? If so, tell us today."
Reception.
The book was generally well received. The "Economist" described it as "slightly technical, eminently readable, consistently shocking, occasionally hectoring and unapologetically polemical." Helen Lewis in the "New Statesman" called it an important book, while Luisa Dillner, writing in the "Guardian", regarded it as a "thorough piece of investigative medical journalism."
Andrew Jack in the "Financial Times" wrote that Goldacre is "at his best in methodically dissecting poor clinical trials. ... He is less strong in ex­plaining the complex background reality, such as the general constraints and individual slips of regulators and pharma companies' employees." Jack also argued that the book failed to reflect how many lives have been improved by the current system, for example with new treatments for HIV, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.
Max Pemberton, a psychiatrist, wrote in the "Daily Telegraph" that "this is a book to make you enraged ... because it's about how big business puts profits over patient welfare, allows people to die because they don't want to disclose damning research evidence, and the tricks they play to make sure doctors do not have all the evidence when it comes to appraising whether a drug really works or not."
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) replied in the "New Statesman" that Goldacre was "stuck in a bygone era where pharmaceutical companies wine and dine doctors in exchange for signing on the dotted line." The ABPI issued a press release, writing that the pharmaceutical industry is responsible for the discovery of 90 percent of all medicines, and that it takes an average of 10–12 years and £1.1bn to introduce a medicine to the market, with just one in 5,000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval. This makes research and development an expensive and risky business. They wrote that the industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the world, and is committed to ensuring full transparency in the research and development of new medicines. They also maintained that the examples Goldacre offered were "long documented and historical, and the companies concerned have long addressed these issues." Goldacre argues in the book that "the most dangerous tactic of all is the industry's enduring claim that these problems are all in the past."
Humphrey Rang of the British Pharmacological Society wrote that Goldacre had chosen his target well and had produced some shocking examples of secrecy and dishonesty, particularly the nondisclosure of data on the antidepressant reboxetine (chapter one), in which only one trial out of seven was published (the published study showed positive results, while the unpublished trials suggested otherwise). He argued that Goldacre had gone "over the top" in devoting a whole chapter (chapter five) to recommending large clinical trials using electronic patient data from general practitioners, without fully pointing out how problematic these can be; such trials raise issues, for example, about informed consent and regulatory oversight. Rang also criticized Goldacre's style, describing the book as too long, repetitive, hyperbolic, and in places too conversational. He particularly objected to the line, "medicine is broken," calling it a "foolish remark."
AllTrials.
Following the book's publication, Goldacre co-founded AllTrials with David Tovey, editor-in-chief of the Cochrane Library, together with the "British Medical Journal", the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, and others in the UK, and Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in the US. Set up in January 2013, the group campaigns for all past and current clinical trials to be registered and reported, for all treatments in use.
The British House of Commons Public Accounts Committee produced a report in January 2014, after hearing evidence from Goldacre, Fiona Godlee, editor-in-chief of the "British Medical Journal", and others, about the stockpiling of Tamiflu and the withholding of data about the drug by its manufacturer, Roche. The committee said it was "surprised and concerned" to learn that information from clinical trials is routinely withheld from doctors, and recommended that the Department of Health take steps to ensure that all clinical-trial data be made available for currently prescribed treatments.

T.B. (Thompson Brothers)

T.B. was a three-wheeled cyclecar manufactured by the aircraft department of Thompson Brothers of Bilston, England, from 1919 until 1924. A prototype four-wheel car never entered production. Approximately 150 cars were produced of which only one example is believed to have survived.
History.
Thompson Brothers was founded in 1810 in Bilston in the Black Country region of South Staffordshire (now the West Midlands), and in 1882 it was purchased by Enoch Stephen Thompson. The company was based at the Bradley Engineering Works, on Great Bridge Road, Bilston. Initially they manufactured steam boilers, but during World War I they diversified into aircraft components. After the war the tax regulations lead to a boom in cyclecar production so the aircraft department produced a three-wheeled, open, two seater, cycle car that followed aircraft engineering practises and workmanship standards, using high grade materials.
The main appeal of cycle-cars was cheapness to buy and run, but in the overpopulated car market of the 1920s the cost of four-wheeled cars fell to that of cycle-cars, the business tailed off, component acquisition was troublesome, and T.B. only sold 150 cars. Although they designed a four-wheeled car it was never produced. 
After the demise of the cyclecar business Thompson became a leading manufacturer of commercial vehicles such as fuel tankers and airport fire tenders. In the mid-1930s, an unusual three-wheeled aircraft refueller was introduced and during World War II many of these were manufactured for military use. Many of these continued in use at civil aerodromes and airports in Britain until the 1960s and 1970s. At least 20 examples are thought to survive today.
Eventually the company became part of the Northern Engineering Industries Group.
Models.
The first model produced was the 1920 cyclecar equipped with a 10 hp. air-cooled engine mated to a leather clutch and two-speed gearbox. Design and development had taken approximately 12 months and a prototype completed a 2,000 mile test. The shapely "radiator" was a combined three-gallon petrol tank and three-quart oil tank. 
By 1921 they used a 10 hp JAP water cooled engine and a floating plate clutch to drive the three-speed gearbox. 
By 1924 the sports model was equipped with a 10 hp water cooled Anzani engine and an aluminium body.

There is reportedly only one model still surviving, at the Black Country Living Museum at Dudley.

2016 Vintage Yachting Games

The 2016 Vintage Yachting Games would be the 3rd post-Olympic multi-class sailing event for discontinued Olympic classes. The event is due to be held on 17–25 June 2016 at Weymouth Bay in Dorset, Great Britain. This would be the first Vintage not held on the 'The Continent'. The organization of this event will be in the hands of the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy. The Vintage Yachting Games Organization (VYGO) will govern the organization.
Bidding.
The bidding process was officially launched on 14 December 2010. The bidding process intended to run till 31 December 2011. This period was extended on request of several candidates.
Before the bidding process started there was an interest for hosting the event from:
During the bidding process this group extended with:
By the end of the process two candidates host clubs were left:
The Vintage Yachting Games supervisory board finally voted unanimous to accept the bid of the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy and not for reopening or extending the bidding process. The venue of the 2016 Vintage Yachting Games was formally announced during the closing ceremony of the 2012 edition.
Venue and infrastructure.
In 2012, the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy (WPNSA) was chosen as the venue for the 2016 Vintage. WPNSA was chosen to host these events due to its existing World class facilities. Since the 2012 Olympics the existing facilities were extended with a new 220 m slipway accessible at all states of tide and wind, an additional 70 marina berths and an extended dinghy park with capacity for 600 boats and a jetty with two fixed cranes for the keelboat launching in sheltered water. In addition, the Academy provides direct access to Portland Harbor and Weymouth Bay which have been credited as some of the best sailing waters in the World. The exact dates of the 2016 Vintage events will announced later in 2012. Courses can be laid in Portland Harbor and out in Weymouth Bay.
Preparations.
Preparations of the 2016 Vintage Yachting Games will start as soon as practical after the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic sailing activities.
Vintage Yachting Classes.
Estimated participation.
Based upon the fact that the Vintage Yachting Games Organization aims for about 20 boats at the starting line the first estimated number of participants boats will be 240 and 480 sailors.

Polsko-angielsko-niemiecki Glosariusz regionalny Województwa Opolskiego

Polsko-angielsko-niemiecki Glosariusz regionalny Województwa Opolskiego ("The Polish-English-German Glossary of the Regional Terminology of the Province of Opole") is a Polish book written by Tomasz Kamusella, which has been banned by the Polish government.
Censorship in Opole Province.
The reference work, "Polsko-angielsko-niemiecki Glosariusz regionalny Województwa Opolskiego" (The Polish-English-German Glossary of the Regional Terminology of the Province of Opole), written by Tomasz Kamusella was published in 2004 in Opole by the publishing house, Oficyna Piastowska (ISBN 8389357186). The book’s run of 2000 copies was destroyed by Roman Hlawacz, the owner of the Oficyna Piastowska, on the order of the Self-Governmental Regional Authority ("Urząd Marszałkowski") of the Province of Opole, Poland, transmitted to him orally by Ewa Rurynkiewicz, a Deputy President of the Province of Opole. The step was taken, because in the overview of the history of the region the reference, apart from giving the Polish and Soviet view according to which the new German-Polish border was recognized in 1945 at the Potsdam Conference, also included the view propounded by the Western Allies and West Germany, namely, that the border was finally and fully recognized in light of international law only when the German-Polish Border Treaty (1990) was ratified in 1992. Although the glossary was positively reviewed for publication (including the information on the status of the German-Polish frontier) by the Opole sociologist, Danuta Berlińska and the Opole politician, Danuta Jazłowiecka, at present a MEP; Deputy President Ryszard Galla publicly appealed for burning all the copies of the Glossary.
A press campaign against the Glossary and its author commenced on May 8, 2004 when the radical nationalist, Jerzy Czerwiński (pl), at a press conference in Opole, falsely announced that the Glossary claims that Opole Province is part of Germany. The leading Polish dailies repeated this claim without checking what is actually written in the book. Within days, Józef Musielok (pl), Rector of Opole University, publicly announced his wish to punish the author of the Glossary, who then worked at the University. The University’s Faculty of Philology, headed by Dean Stanisław Kochman (pl) condemned Tomasz Kamusella and his glossary, without informing him about the matter, or letting him present his own opinion on the issue.
Censorship in the National Library of Poland.
The Opole Province President, Grzegorz Kubat (pl), accused the Glossary’s author of a crime unknown to the Polish law, namely, of ‘breaching Poland’s "raison d'état".’ Hence, the accusation was dismissed as unfounded. Meanwhile, the regional authority secretly, in an extrajudicial manner and thus illegally, ordered the National Library of Poland ("Biblioteka Narodowa") not to lend its two copies of the Glossary. This library complied readily, providing no legal basis for its decision.
The library made its two copies of the Glossary accessible to readers only in early 2012, after the regionally authority, withdrew this extrajudicial ban, claiming that the library had never been bound by the authority's 'advice' on the Glossary. Furthermore, the library admitted that it was the first time in its history that a book in its holdings was made inaccessible to readers.

Carolina Moon (1940 film)

Carolina Moon is a 1940 American Western film directed by Frank McDonald and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, and June Storey. Based on a story by Connie Lee, the film is about a singing cowboy who comes to the aid of plantation owners who are being robbed of their land by a scheming lumber company.
Plot.
While riding the rodeo circuit, singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) meet Southerners Caroline Stanhope (June Storey) and her grandfather (Eddy Waller). The Stanhopes are hoping to win prize money in order to pay back taxes on their plantation. Their hopes are shattered when Caroline's horse Valdena is injured in an accident and unable to compete in the rodeo. With no hope of winning the prize money, Stanhope gets involved in a card game and loses $1,000 to some gamblers. With no money, he offers to give them Valdena, his only asset, but the gamblers refuse.
After the rodeo, Gene gives the old man his winnings for Valdena so he can settle his debt with the gamblers. Caroline is suspicious of Gene's generosity and thinks he is trying to cheat her grandfather. Later, after her grandfather gets drunk, Caroline packs him and the horse into their car and drives back home. When Gene discovers that they've gone, he follows them, intending to protect his investment. When he arrives at the Stanhope plantation, he learns that the Stanhopes and their neighbors are in danger of losing their land for delinquent back taxes.
The plantation owners are unaware that a new timber process has been developed that will turn their property into valuable timber land. Lumber company representative Barrett (Robert Fiske) is scheming to cheat the plantation owners out of their land. He's elicited the help of Henry Wheeler (Hardie Albright), the only prosperous plantation owner in the county.
In an effort to help the plantation owners pay their back taxes, Gene enters Valdena in a steeplejack race. After Wheeler deliberately fouls the horse during the race, Gene becomes suspicious of his motives, eventually learning the truth. Gene convinces the plantation owners to harvst and sell the lumber themselves, but Wheeler and Barrett thwart their efforts by holding up the lumberjacks so they cannot meet the terms of their contracts. Undaunted, Gene sends for his cowboy friends, who arrive and do the lumberjacking themselves, saving the plantations.

Constantine Stilbes

Constantine Stilbes (, ) was a Byzantine rhetor and clergyman, and a prolific author of ecclesiastical treatises, letters, and poetry.
Biography.
He was born in the mid-12th century and the date of his death is unknown. From his own writings it is clear that he became a deacon and magister in the Patriarchal School of Constantinople. A little before 1204 he was promoted to the metropolitan bishopric of Cyzicus, which he had to relinquish shortly after the Latin conquest. Although most of what is known about Stilbes comes from his own works, Niketas Choniates does praise a certain "Stilbes, a good man in every regard" ().
Works.
Stilbes' works pertain mostly to theology, the best known among scholars is his "Errors of the Latin Church," which Stilbes compiled in the wake of the Fourth Crusade. The list describes western "errors," including their failure to honour foreign saints and their hatred of the Emperor Constantine for creating New Rome. Stilbes is also known for his poem describing a catastrophic fire that took place in Constantinople on July 25, 1197. Running to about a thousand lines, the "Carmen de Incendio" describes the course of the fire along the Golden Horn from the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kapısı) through the Latin Quarter, using ekphrases rich with Biblical and Classical metaphors. The poem is an important resource for those studying the urban topography of Medieval Constantinople, as it describes the burning of three story houses and aristocratic houses with turrets, and it makes allusions to coastal roads, aqueducts, the Neorion Harbour, granaries, the Church of the Forty Martyrs, and the Church of the Theotokos Kyriotissa. Byzantinist Paul Magdalino has used the poem to date the medieval reconstruction of the Kyriotissa church to between the date of the fire in 1197 and the Fourth Crusade in 1204.

<doc id="36684742" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36684742" title="Duchy of Croatia">
Duchy of Croatia

The Duchy of Croatia () or Duchy of the Croats (), also known as Dalmatian Croatia () and Littoral Croatia (), is a name for a medieval Croatian duchy which was established in the former Roman province of Dalmatia. Throughout its time it had several seats, namely Klis, Solin, Biograd, Knin, Biaći and Nin, comprised the "littoral", or coastal part of today's Croatia and included a big part of the mountainous hinterland. The Duchy was in the center of competition between the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire for rule over the area. Rivalry with Venice emerged in the first decades of the 9th century which was to continue for the following centuries. Croatia also waged battles with the Bulgarian Empire, with whom the relations improved greatly afterwards, and the Arabs and sought to extend its control over important coastal cities under the rule of Byzantium. Croatia saw periods of vassalage of the Franks and Byzantines and de facto independence until 879 when under duke Branimir it officially became an independent realm, acknowledged by Pope John VIII. The ruling dynasty of Croatia was the House of Trpimirović, with interruptions by the House of Domagojević (864–878 and 879–c. 892). The Duchy existed until around 925 when, during the rule of Duke Tomislav, Croatia became a kingdom.
Nomenclature.
"Dalmatian Croatia" and "Littoral Croatia" are modern appellations amongst historians for the territory of the Duchy. The state is sometimes called a principality, i.e. the "Principality of Croatia". 
The first recorded name for the Duchy was "Land of the Croats" (). Croatia was not yet a kingdom at the time and the term "regnum" is used in terms of a country in general. In Byzantine sources the entity was usually called just "Croatia" ().
The first known duke, Borna, was named "Duke of Dalmatia" () and later "Duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia" () in the Annales regni Francorum. The Croatian name is recorded in contemporary charters of Croatian dukes from the second half of the 9th century. Trpimir I was named "Duke of the Croats" () in a Latin charter issued in 852, while Branimir was defined as "Duke of the Croats" () on a preserved inscription from Šopot near Benkovac.
Geography.
Within the area of the Roman province of Dalmatia, various tribal groupings, which were called "sclaviniae" by the Byzantines, were settled along the Adriatic coast. Croatia in the early Middle Ages was an area bounded by the Eastern Adriatic hinterland on one side, then extended to a part of western Herzegovina, western and central Bosnia, then into Lika, Gacka and Krbava, and North-West to Vinodol and Labin in the Croatian Littoral area. Several coastal Dalmatian cities were under the rule of the Byzantines, including Split, Zadar, Kotor and Dubrovnik, as well as islands of Hvar and Krk. To the south Croatia bordered with the land of the Narentines, which stretched from the rivers Cetina to Neretva, and had the islands of Brač, Hvar, Korčula, Mljet, Vis and Lastovo in its possession. In the southern part of Dalmatia, there was Zahumlje (Zachumlia), Travunia and Dioclea (today Montenegro). North of Croatia there was the Duchy of Pannonia. Croatia, as well as other early medieval states, didn't have a permanent capital and Croatian dukes resided in various places on their courts. The first important center of Croatia was Klis near Split, where Duke Trpimir I resided. Other dukes ruled from the towns of Solin, Biograd, Knin, Biaći and Nin.
History.
Background.
Most of Dalmatia was in the 7th century under the Avar Khaganate, a nomadic confederacy led by the Avars who subjugated surrounding Slavic tribes. In 614 the Avars sacked and destroyed the capital of the province of Dalmatia, Salona, and retained direct control of the region for a few decades until they were driven out by the Croats. The earliest recorded Croatian duke who led the Croats at that time, referred to by the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, was Porga. The Croats were either invited into Dalmatia by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (r. 610-641) and allowed to settle there after they defeated the local Avars, or the Croats settled on their own, prevailing the Avars after a lengthy war. In the early 9th century, Croatia emerged as a political entity with a duke as head of the state, territorially in the basins of the rivers Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja. It was administered in 11 counties ("Županije"). According to De Administrando Imperio, the Croats in Dalmatia were subject to the Franks for several years, ""as they had formerly been in their own country"", until they rebelled and defeated the Franks after a seven-year war, but it is not known on which specific war and time span this refers to.
It has usually been assumed that Porinos was in fact Duke Borna. Although the Christianization of Croats began right after their arrival to Dalmatia, in the early 9th century a part of the Croats were still pagan. 
Frankish vassalage.
The Franks gained control of Pannonia and Dalmatia in the 790s and the first decade of the ninth century. In 788 Charlemagne, after conquering Lombardy, turned further east and subjugated Istria. In the 790s duke Vojnomir of Pannonia accepted the Frankish overlordship, whose land the Franks placed under the March of Friuli and tried to extend their rule over the Croatians of Dalmatia. In 799 the Franks under the leadership of duke Eric were defeated in the Battle of Trsat in Liburnia. However, from 803 Frankish rule was recognized in most of northern Dalmatia. The Franks also waged wars with the Byzantine Empire until a peace treaty, known as the Pax Nicephori, was signed in 812. By that treaty the Byzantines retained control of the coastal cities and islands in Dalmatia, while acknowledging Frankish rule over Istria and the Dalmatian hinterland. From c. 810 Borna, who resided in Nin, ruled most of northern Dalmatia and was a vassal of the Carolingian Empire. Borna was Duke of the Guduscani, a Croatian tribe that lived along the river Guduča near Bribir in northern Dalmatia, later the center of the Croatian state. His rule was marked by the rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski against the Franks, who defeated Borna in 819 somewhere near the River Kupa and began to ravage Dalmatia, but harsh conditions and constant attacks from Borna's men forced Ljudevit to retreat. In 821 Borna died and was succeeded by his nephew Vladislav.
Between East and West.
The Duchy of Croatia was located between two major powers of the Middle Ages: the Eastern Roman Empire in the East which controlled the Dalmatian cities and islands and aimed to extend their rule over the entire former Roman province of Dalmatia, and the Franks in the West seeking to control the northern and northwestern lands. The Byzantine influence on Croatia was also reflected on the creation of Croatian law and in trade with the Byzantine coastal cities.
In the second quarter of the 9th century the Croats began developing a navy. Along with the Narentines, who were still pagan at the time and occupied the territory of the river Neretva mouth, they were active in the Adriatic Sea and made shipping and traveling in the area hazardous, especially for Venice. Therefore in 839 the Venetians under Doge Pietro Tradonico attacked the eastern coast of the Adriatic, including Croatia, but during the assault they signed peace with their ruler, "princeps" Mislav (), who ruled from Klis near Split. The peace treaty was signed at a place named St. Martin. The Doge also attacked Narentine islands, but failed to defeat them and made peace with their leader, who is mentioned as count "Drosaico" by the chronicler John the Deacon. However, the peace treaty was short-lasting and next year the Venetians were defeated by the Narentines under count "Diuditum". Piracy continued in the Adriatic, as well as hostility towards Venice, which is seen from the contract between Emperor Lothair I and Doge Tradonico, in which the Doge committed himself to defend the cities in Italy and Istria from Slavic attacks.
Duke Mislav was succeeded around 845 by Trpimir I, who continued the formal legacy of being the vassal of the Frankish king Lothair (840–855), although he managed to strengthen his personal rule in Croatia. Arab campaigns thoroughly weakened the Byzantine Empire and Venice, which was used in the advance of the Croatian duke in 846 and 848. In 846 Trpimir successfully attacked the Byzantine coastal cities and their "patricius". Between 854 and 860, he successfully defended his land from the Bulgarian invasion under Knyaz Boris I of Bulgaria, somewhere in Northeastern Bosnia, concluding a peace treaty with Boris and exchanging gifts. Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions the traditional friendship between the Bulgarians and Croatians, who coexisted peacefully up to that time.
In a Latin charter preserved in a rewrite from 1568, dated to 4 March 852 or, according to a newer research, about 840, Trpimir refers to himself as "leader of the Croats with the help of God" (); his land, called "Kingdom of the Croats" (), can simply be interpreted as the "Realm of the Croats", since Trpimir was not a king. The term "regnum" was also used by other dukes of that time as a sign of their independence. This charter also documents his ownership of castle Klis, from where his rule was centered, and mentions Mislav's donations to the Archbishopric of Split. In the proximity of his court in Klis, in Rižinice, Trpimir built a church and the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia. Trpimir's name is inscribed on a stone fragment from an altar screen of the Rižinice monastery church. He is more expressly remembered as the founder of the House of Trpimirović, a native Croat dynasty that ruled, with interruptions, from 845 until 1091 in Croatia.
In 864 duke Domagoj, founder of the House of Domagojević, usurped the throne after the death of Trpimir and forced his sons, including Zdeslav, to flee to Constantinople. During the rule of Domagoj piracy was a common practice in the Adriatic. The pirates attacked Christian saliors, including a ship with papal legates returning from the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council, thus forcing the Pope to intervene by asking Domagoj to stop piracy, but his efforts were of no avail. Domagoj waged wars with Arabs, Venetians and Franks. In 871 he helped the Franks, as their vassal, to seize Bari from the Arabs, but later actions of the Franks under the rule of Carloman of Bavaria led to a revolt by Domagoj against the Frankish rule. The revolt succeeded and Frankish overlordship in Dalmatia ended, but was to continue a little longer over Pannonian Croatia. Domagoj's rule also saw increased Byzantine influence in the area, especially reflected in the establishment of Theme of Dalmatia. After the death of Domagoj in 876 Zdeslav, who had close ties to Byzantium, returned from exile, usurped the throne from an unnamed son of Domagoj and restored peace with Venice in 878.
Independent realm.
Duke Zdeslav's reign was short and ended in 879 when Branimir of the House of Domagojević killed him and usurped the throne. Branimir was unlike Zdeslav a proponent of Rome and returned the country to the Roman fold. He had regular contacts with Pope John VIII, to whom he sent a letter revealing his intentions to entrust his people and his country to the Apostolic See. The Pope replied to his requests, praising his initiative and in 879 the Duchy under Branimir, now free of Frankish suzerainty, received papal recognition as a state.
The second half of the 9th century marked a significant increase in papal influence in the Southeastern Europe. Pope John VIII complained to Domagoj about the obstinacy of Patriarch Ignatius who denied his jurisdiction over Bulgaria and appointed a new Archbishop. The Pope also requested from dukes Zdeslav and Branimir assistance and protection for his legates who were crossing Croatia on their way to Bulgaria. Although the exact geographical extent of the Duchy is not known, these requests confirm geographical contiguity between Croatia and Bulgaria, which bordered probably somewhere in Bosnia.
Muncimir (also called Mutimir), the youngest son of Trpimir, came to throne after the death of Branimir (c. 892), which marked the return of the House of Trpimirović to power. A Latin charter from Biaći near Trogir dated to 28 September 892 named Muncimir "Duke of the Croats" (). During his rule, in the late 9th century the Hungarians crossed the Carpathians and entered the Carpathian Basin. They invaded northern Italy and also defeated Duke Braslav from the Duchy of Pannonia, endangering Croatia.
Muncimir ruled until about 910 when he was succeeded by Tomislav, the last duke and the first king of Croatia. Venetian chronicler John the Deacon wrote that in 912 a Venetian ambassador, returning from Bulgaria, passed through Croatian territory before reaching the land of Zahumlje, which suggests that Croatia at the time also bordered Bulgaria, then under the rule of Simeon I. In Historia Salonitana, a chronicle from the 13th century written by Thomas the Archdeacon from Split, Tomislav was mentioned as Duke of Croatia in 914. According to De Administrando Imperio, Croatia at the time had 100,000 infantrymen and 60,000 horsemen, 80 large ships and 100 smaller vessels, but these numbers are viewed as a clear exaggeration and an overemphasis of the Croatian forces. Croatia also waged battles with the Magyars during the early 10th century.
During the war between the Byzantium and Bulgaria of Simeon I, in about 923, the Byzantines concluded an alliance with Croatia. Prior to that the Bulgarians had several decisive victories against the Byzantines, capturing Adrianople and endangering Constantinople. In 924 Simeon I deposed Zaharija from rule in Serbia, who fled to Croatia. In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, but were severely defeated in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. In 927 Pope John X sent his legates to mediate a peace treaty between Croats and Bulgarians.
During these years Croatia was elevated to the status of a kingdom. It is generally said that duke Tomislav was crowned king in 925, but this is not certain since it is not known when and where was he crowned, or was he crowned at all. However, Tomislav was the first Croatian ruler whom the Papal chancellery honoured with the title king. Tomislav is mentioned as a king in two preserved documents published in the Historia Salonitana and by the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, who specified Tomislav's rule at 13 years. In a note preceding the text of the Council conclusions in Split in 925 it is written that Tomislav is the king "in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions" ("in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege"). In the 12th canon of the Council conclusions in 925 the ruler of the Croats is called "king" ("rex et proceres Chroatorum"), while in a letter sent by the Pope John X Tomislav is named "King of the Croats" ("Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum"). Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves "kings".

Marguerite Jones [Davis] (November 3, 1917 – May 9, 1995) was a Canadian pitcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 9", 150 lb., she batted and threw right handed.
Born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Marguerite Jones was one of the fifty seven girls from Canada who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during its 12 year history.
Jones pitched in the league during the 1944 season, but without much success. She opened the year with the Minneapolis Millerettes and was traded to the Rockford Peaches in the midseason, posting a combined record of 6-12 and a 3.70 earned run average in 28 pitching appearances. Even though she batted a meager .162 average in 33 games, Jones walked 24 times to collect a solid .387 on-base percentage and also swiped 25 bases.
Jones returned to Canada during the offseason to marry Gordon Davis in 1945. She then left the league behind and played softball in Regina for several years, while raising a family of four children: Ron, Jerry, Carol and Tom. By 1958, the family moved to Moose Jaw. She was widowed in 1985.
Marguerite, who earned the nickname ″The Lady″ because of her sweet and gentle temperament, rejoined her former teammates and opponents during the inaugural ceremony of "Women in Baseball" at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. This permanent display was unveiled in to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual figure.
She later developed Alzheimer's disease, and died in 1995 at the age of 77. "As her short time memory failed, her long term memory actually improved for a while", explained her son, Ron. "Among her most cherished memories was her time in the AAGPBL and the sport she loved", he added.
Three years after her death, Marguerite gained honorary induction into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

Wesermünde Geest

The Wesermünde Geest () is the collective name for several geest ridges in the west of Cuxhaven district and Bremen-Nord in Germany. The ridges are separated from one another by wetlands. These terminal moraines were formed during the Saale glaciation, are up to between 10 and 70 metres above sea level (NN), and are covered by scattered woods and farmland. The wetland areas, between 0 and 5 metres above sea level, are predominantly used for grazing.
Location.
The Wesermünde is bounded to the south by the River Lesum in the northern part of Bremen,
to the west by the marshes of Osterstade (on the Lower Weser south of Bremerhaven) and Land Wursten (on the Outer Weser north of Bremerhaven). To the north, the Wesermünde Geest is bordered by Land Hadeln, part of the Elbe marshes, and the Elbe estuary near Cuxhaven. Its eastern boundary is formed by the rivers Oste, as far as the town of Bremervörde, and Hamme with the great bog of the Teufelsmoor near Osterholz-Scharmbeck. East of these rivers is the Zeven Geest that, like the Wesermünde Geest, is part of the natural region of the Stade Geest. 
About 10 km south of the city boundary of Bremerhaven the Weser tributary, the Lune and its valley, cuts through the Wesermünde Geest. The part lying south of the Lune is called the Osterholz Geest and lies mostly in the district of Osterholz. The higher areas of this part of the geest, which are over 40 metres above sea level ("Normalnull") in places, form the region of Bremen Switzerland, the Lange Heide heath and the Eulenberg between Brillit and Basdahl. Numerous geest perimeter streams rise here, including the Giehler Bach which forms the headstream of the Hamme, and the Drepte.
The northern part of the Wesermünde Geest lies for the most part within the district of Cuxhaven. In the west part near Lamstedt the land rises to over 60 metres in the Westerberg area, and in the Wingst near Cadenberge even up to 74 metres above sea level. The part of the Wesermünde Geest north of the River Geeste is characterised by numerous shallow valleys and bogs and only reaches heights of over 25 metres in the area south of Bederkesa and in the Wurster Heide. The northwestern part of the geest from Bremerhaven-Lehe to Cuxhaven-Altenwalde forms the Hohe Lieth and Wurster Heide.
Landscape and vegetation.
In addition to intensive grazing, the geest is also used for arable farming. In addition, its numerous pine woods are used for forestry. The raised bogs in the northern part of the geest have had their peat deposits almost completely removed. On the higher elevations, there are also near-natural deciduous forests and a many areas of heathland. The countless rivers and streams that cut through the ridges of the geest, form shallow valleys in which blanket bogs are found. The state of Bremen has established a nature reserve (the "Hammersbecker Wiesen") in such a depression to preserve the Beckedorfer Beeke.
Name.
The name "Wesermünde Geest" goes back to the former independent Prussian town of Wesermünde, that between 1924 and 1947 made up the largest part of the present city of Bremerhaven. It was the headquarters of the eponymous "Landkreis", in whose territory the largest part of the Wesermünde Geest lay. On 1 August 1977 the district of Wesermünde was disbanded and replaced by the newly created district of Cuxhaven. The name "Wesermünder Geest", occasionally used in the 1920s and 1930s, is very uncommon.

J. S. Grimaldi

Joseph Samuel William Grimaldi (21 November 1802 – 10 December 1832), better known as J. S. Grimaldi or JS Grimaldi, was an English stage actor, comedian and dancer, who frequently played the role of Clown in the harlequinades that accompanied nineteenth-century pantomimes. He was the son of Joseph Grimaldi, who popularised the role of Clown in the early 1800s.
The young Grimaldi began his career in 1814 playing in a version of "Don Juan", and in other roles, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. Throughout his teenage years, he was a successful performer, starring in "Harlequin and Fortunio; or, Shing-Moo and Thun-Ton" (1815), "The Fates; or, Harlequin's Holy Day" (1818), and "Harlequin and Friar Bacon" (1820), but he grew to resent the often unfavourable comparisons made between him and his famous father.
Grimaldi turned increasingly to alcohol over the years, becoming unreliable, abusive and ultimately unemployable. He was mostly unemployed throughout his 20s, making his final appearance in a revival of "Don Juan" in 1832. He died later that year, at the age of 30.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Grimaldi was born in Clerkenwell, London, to the actor Joseph Grimaldi and his dancer wife Mary Bristow. Grimaldi's father popularised the role of Clown in the harlequinade of the early 1800s and invented the modern conception of whiteface clown. His father introduced Grimaldi to the eccentric atmosphere at both Drury Lane and Sadler's Wells from the age of 18 months. Although eager to have Joseph Samuel follow him onto the stage, his father felt that it was important for the boy to have an education, and so he enrolled him at Mr Ford's Academy, a boarding-school in Putney, which taught the children of theatrical performers. JS excelled at school and became fluent in French. After Ford's Academy, he attended a private school in Pentonville.
Young Grimaldi made his professional debut, shortly before his 12th birthday, on 10 October 1814, as Friday in a pantomime version of "Robinson Crusoe" at the Sadler's Wells Theatre opposite his father, who played the title character. Although his father was initially against the idea of his young son becoming a performer, he saw the boy's promise when he starred alongside him in the piece. He became known professionally as JS Grimaldi. Later in 1814, Grimaldi made his second professional appearance, playing the part of Scaramouche in a hugely profitable pantomime of "Don Juan" at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, while his father played the title role. The success of the piece confirmed, in his father's mind, that Grimaldi was more than capable of sustaining his own career.
Adolescence.
In 1814, Grimaldi's father fell ill. The seizure kept Joseph Grimaldi house bound for four months, and the theatre's receipts fell by £50 as a result. This left the 12-year-old JS to perform, for the first time, without his father by his side. The challenge resulted in an improvement in the boy's performing skills. The following year, Grimaldi and his father played together in "Harlequin and Fortunio; or, Shing-Moo and Thun-Ton", the first pantomime known to have featured a principal boy. Grimaldi played Miniature Clown opposite his father, who played "Adult Clown".
JS enjoyed a successful performing career throughout his teenage years. In 1818 his father took over the running of Sadler's Wells and offered Grimaldi the role of Clown in "The Fates; or, Harlequin's Holy Day", opposite his parents and the comedian Jack Bologna. Grimaldi and his father also toured together. After a few productions in 1819, Sadler's Wells Theatre was sold, and Grimaldi toured Ireland with his father in 1820. That September, he appeared in a version of "Aladdin", followed by the Christmas pantomime "Harlequin and Friar Bacon" in which he played Friar Bacon. Both were staged at Covent Garden theatre, with the pantomime being particularly successful. In May 1821, Joseph Grimaldi collapsed on stage from exhaustion during a performance of "Undine; or, the Spirit of the Waters". His doctors diagnosed the 42-year-old performer as suffering from "premature old age". JS took over his father's role and completed the remainder of the show's run. Now acting as his father's official understudy, Grimaldi fulfilled many of his father's theatrical engagements, including a revival of "Harlequin and Friar Bacon" 1821 and "Harlequin and Mother Bunch; or, the Yellow Dwarf", both in 1821.
Grimaldi made a career of emulating his father's act and received favourable notices as a clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father's. As his career blossomed, he was increasingly and unfavourably compared with his more famous father in terms of personality and acting ability. The comparisons affected his self-confidence. Grimaldi's desire to distance himself professionally from his famous father had intensified during their constant touring of the provincial theatres together. Grimaldi heard of an outrage committed in 1820 by the actor Robert Bradbury, who assaulted a heckler in his audience. Bradbury gained a rebellious reputation because of it; something which appealed greatly to Grimaldi, as it was an act so far removed from his father's gentle reputation. During the 1821 pantomime "Harlequin and Mother Bunch", Grimaldi caused a scandal and was censured for threatening and verbally abusing an audience member who criticised his performance.
Decline.
The critical comparisons between Grimaldi and his father also adversely affected their father-son relationship. By the early 1820s, Grimaldi became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. JS turned to alcohol and became increasingly unreliable; his professional engagements became rare as theatre managers were reluctant to hire him. He survived two suicide attempts: in 1821 he cut his throat, and two years later he lacerated himself on a window. Fortunes at Sadler's Wells were also dwindling, with lessees failing to mount new engagements, thus leaving Grimaldi out of work. His alcoholism effectively ended his career as he became abusive to colleagues and even more unreliable.
Grimaldi became estranged from his parents in 1823, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as Grimaldi went out of his way to avoid them. They communicated only through written correspondence, with Grimaldi often sending his son letters begging for money. Grimaldi stated to his father that "At present I am in difficulties; but as long as I earn a shilling you shall have half." Grimaldi finally returned home in 1827, when his parents were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled. He was taken in by his parents, who managed to secure him a number of brief theatrical engagements, including a few Christmas pantomimes and benefits for his father.
Grimaldi's lack of a steady income eventually led to him being incarcerated in a debtors' prison. Upon his release on 3 March 1831, he moved in with his parents, who again tried to find him employment; their efforts failed because he did not appear for rehearsals. Grimaldi soon reverted to his old ways and often abused his parents' charitable nature by bringing home prostitutes and fighting with his alcoholic friends within the house. He moved out later that year.
His final performance was at the Tottenham Street Theatre in a production of "Don Juan", in 1832, playing the part of Scaramouche.
Death.
Grimaldi died at age 30 on 11 December 1832 in Tottenham and was interred at Whitefield's Tabernacle. The cause of his death remains a mystery and was treated with some suspicion. Although he had been an alcoholic and had suffered from epilepsy and bouts of mental illness for many years, there were suspicions that he had been poisoned or had died as a result of injuries sustained in a drunken brawl. His parents were devastated by his death and attempted suicide but survived. His mother died in 1834, and his father survived him by five years.

Henry Charles Lennox Anderson

Henry Charles Lennox (H.C.L.) Anderson (May 10, 1853 - March 17, 1924) was instrumental in the establishment of the Mitchell Library (now The State Library of New South Wales) and held the position of Principal Librarian of the New South Wales Free Public Library as it was then known, from 1893 - 1906.
The Australian Library and Information Association’s H.C.L. Anderson award, named in his memory, is given for outstanding service to the Library profession.
Early life and education.
Henry Charles Lennox Anderson was born at sea on the "Empire" on May 10, 1853. His father, Robert Anderson, later became a police inspector, and his mother was Margaret, née Hewson. H.C.L. Anderson attended Sydney Grammar School before attaining a scholarship to attend the University of Sydney.
Agricultural career.
H.C.L. Anderson was appointed New South Wales's first director of agriculture in February 1890, a department that was established as a branch of the Department of Mines. In 1891, he established Hawkesbury Agricultural College and the following year, in 1892 established the Wagga Wagga Experiment Farm.
Contribution to the library industry.
H.C.L. Anderson did not seek a career in libraries, he found himself in the role of Principal Librarian when in 1893 his Agriculture department was virtually closed down and on September 1, 1893 he was appointed principal librarian of the Free Public Library at a reduced salary, a position for which it is reported he had 'no desire'. Despite an inauspicious beginning, H.C.L. Anderson became internationally known for developing 101 rules of cataloguing with the use of subject headings. In 1896 he published "Guide to the Catalogues of the Reference Library". An active member of the Library Association of Australasia he trained staff and was first to employ women – partly due to their willingness to accept lower salaries. Under Anderson’s leadership the Free Public Library underwent considerable changes with revitalised services and collections developed. He became registrar of copyright in 1901, the same year that he introduced the Dewey Decimal Classification system to the Library.
Anderson first met David Scott Mitchell in 1895 and played a major role in encouraging the collector to bequeath and finance his collections to the Library. Anderson provided space for Mitchell’s collection of 10,000 volumes by moving out of his house in 1898. It took a public inquiry and five years before planning began for the Mitchell Wing of the Free Public Library.
His time as Principal Librarian was not without controversy being accused of fraud and misappropriation of library materials. A Legislative Assembly Select Committee investigated complaints that he used postal concessions, sold donations, and gave preference to some booksellers, and included ‘blue’ books in the collections. After five years of investigation, he was exonerated with recommendations made for proper housing of the Mitchell Collection. In 1905 Anderson became director of the State Intelligence Department and in 1907 Government Statistician. In 1908 he returned to the re-established Department of Agriculture – accepting the position because it paid better than the Library.
H.C.L. Anderson Award.
Named in memory of H.C.L. Anderson, the HCL Anderson Award is the highest honour that can be bestowed on an Associate member of the Australian Library and Information Association. "It is awarded in recognition of outstanding service to the library and information profession in Australia, to ALIA, or to the theory of library and information science or to the practice of library and information services."

<doc id="36685164" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36685164" title="Return of Owners of Land, 1873">
Return of Owners of Land, 1873

The Return of Owners of Land, 1873 presents the first complete picture of the distribution of landed property in the British Isles since the original Domesday Book dating from 1086. The 1873 Return is also sometimes referred to as the "Modern Domesday". It arose from the desire of the Victorian governing landed classes, many of whom sat in the House of Lords, to counter the rising public clamour, encouraged by some parts of the press, raised about what was called the "monopoly of land". Karl Marx (d.1883) had been resident in London since 1849 and had published his Das Kapital in 1867, influential on the Continent, and the British Establishment was keen to rapidly extinguish any spark of revolutionary sentiment in the United Kingdom.
Many perceived exaggerations and false assertions had been made by the opponents of the landed classes as to the over-concentration of land ownership within a ruling elite, and reliable and independent data was needed in order to refute the attacks. The question was put in the House of Lords on 19 February 1872 by Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (1826–1893) to the Lord Privy Seal "Whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to take any steps for ascertaining the number of proprietors of land and houses in the United Kingdom, with the quantity of land owned by each proprietor". The government was in agreement with the suggestion and indeed Lord Derby's question had been a mere pre-arranged formality in order to start the process.
In 1872 Local Government Boards were ordered to compile a list of owners of land from ratings records. One return was prepared for England and Wales, excluding the Metropolis, and separate ones were prepared for Scotland in 1874, and Ireland in 1876. The Return shows the holding, in acres, roods and poles, and estimated yearly rental, of all holdings over 1 acre. It is laid out by county and landowner with a principal identifying address being given for each landowner. In the case of landowners with extensive and scattered holdings the address may not correspond to the location of the land and could be outside the county in question. The location of the land owned is not given. A comparison with the Domesday Book survey was made in the Return's Explanatory Statement (see section below). The 1873 Return was not without inaccuracies, sometimes very significant, and a revised and corrected edition was published in 1883 by John Bateman FRGS (1839–1910) entitled: "The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland".
Background.
The circumstances under which the Return was called for will be best explained by a reference to the following discussion which took place in the House of Lords on the 19th of February 1872 :
The Earl of Derby asked the Lord Privy Seal (Viscount Halifax) whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to take any steps for ascertaining accurately the number of proprietors of land and houses in the United Kingdom, with the quantity of land owned by each proprietor. He should not trouble the House at any length, because he understood that the suggestion he had ventured to put into his question was acquiesced in, and would be acted upon by the Government. They all knew that out-of-doors there was from time to time a great outcry raised about what was called the "monopoly of land", and, in support of that cry, the wildest and most reckless exaggerations and mis-statements of fact were uttered as to the number of persons who were the actual owners of the soil. It had been said again and again that, according to the Census of 1861, there were in the United Kingdom not more than 30,000 landowners; and though it had been repeatedly shown that this estimate arose from a misreading of the figures contained in the Census returns, the statement was continually reproduced, just as though its accuracy had never been disputed. The real state of the case was at present a matter of conjecture, but he believed, for his own part, that 300,000 would be nearer the truth, than the estimate which fixed the landowners of the United Kingdom at a tenth of that number. He entirely disbelieved the truth of the popular notion that small estates were undergoing a gradual process of absorption in the larger ones. It was true that the class of peasant proprietors formerly to be found in the rural districts was tending to disappear—for the very good reason that such proprietors could, as a general rule, obtain from 40 to 50 years' purchase for their holdings, and thereby vastly increase their incomes. In the place of that class, however, there was rapidly growing up a new class of small owners, who, dwelling in or near towns or railway stations, were able to buy small freeholds. He believed this new class would fully replace, and perhaps more than replace, the diminution in the other class to which he had referred. He apprehended that through the agency of the Local Government Board it would be easy to obtain statistical information, which would be conclusive in regard to this matter. The returns ought to include the name of every owner and the extent of his property in acres. He did not wish to have included in the Return the exact dimensions of very minute holdings; that could be met by giving the aggregate extent of holdings not exceeding an acre each, the number of separate owners being stated, but not the extent of each holding.
The Duke of Richmond thought this was a subject the importance of which could scarcely be over-rated, and trusted that Her Majesty's Government would be able to furnish the Return asked for by his noble friend. This, he thought, might easily be done through the agency of the Local Government Board. A vast amount of ignorance existed in regard to the question, and it was surely time that such ignorance was dispelled by means of documents possessing all the weight of Parliamentary Returns, and whose accuracy could not be disputed. There ought to be no alarm raised by such a Return as was asked for, because the rental need not be inserted in it, although even that was given in Scotland. In order to show the great errors into which the public might be led, he would mention a fact brought under his notice by the noble Marquess sitting near him (the Marquess of Salisbury). According to the Census of 1861, the number of landed proprietors in Hertfordshire was only 245. The noble Marquess, however, doubted the accuracy of this statement, and after taking the trouble to investigate the matter for himself, he found that the number of landed proprietors in the county of Hertford at that time, according to the rate-book, was 8,833.
Viscount Halifax said that his attention had been called, as had that of his noble friend opposite (the Earl of Derby), to the extraordinary statements made in certain newspapers, and at some public meetings, respecting the wonderfully small number of landed proprietors in this country. The fact was that very few persons were returned in the Census under the designation of "owners of land". He had looked over pages of the Census returns. The owners of land appeared under various designations, " gentlemen, merchants, shopkeepers, farmers, &c." Very few were returned as "landowners".
For statistical purposes, he thought that we ought to know the number of owners of land in the United Kingdom, and there would be no difficulty in obtaining this information. He held in his hand the valuation list of a parish, giving the name of every owner, a description of the land, the estimated area, and the estimated rental. Such returns existed for every parish in England, and from them a return for all England might be compiled. He quite agreed with his noble friend, that it might not be desirable to give the rental, although he might remark that this was done in Scotland.. He had in his hand the valuation roll of the county of Edinburgh, which contained the rental of every owner in that county. He believed that in Scotland no objection had ever been taken to publishing the amount of rental. The Government considered it most desirable that the return should be prepared, and what he proposed to do was to give a nominal list of every owner of land to the extent of one acre or upwards in every county of England, together with the quantity of land which each owner had in the county. In regard to owners of less than one acre, he thought it would be sufficient to state their number in each county, without specifying their names. The same process would be gone through in Scotland and Ireland.
The Marquess of Salisbury urged that the 999 years leaseholds ought to be included in the Returns.
Viscount Halifax said that there would be great difficulty in ascertaining the precise tenure under which property was held. He quite agreed with the noble Marquess that owners of property held for 999 years, and of land under similar tenures, should appear as owners, and he thought it might be done. The valuation lists, however, to which he had referred only gave information as to the ownership of land and the quantity owned. In his opinion the best plan would be to treat as owner the person immediately above the occupying tenant.
The Earl of Feversham suggested that the Returns should give a description of the land, stating whether it was in cultivation, woodland, or moor.
Viscount Halifax remarked that the Government could not undertake to state the description of the land. An attempt to do this would lead to inextricable confusion.
Publication.
Lord Halifax having accepted the case for the production of a Return, it was prepared by the Local Government Board, and was presented to both Houses of Parliament. The Return comprises the whole of England and Wales, exclusive of the Metropolis. It covered nearly 15,000 parishes whose records contained about 5,000,000 separate assessments. The instructions were issued to the relevant parish officials in September 1872, and the last return was received over two years later. The first examination of the returns disclosed nearly 250,000 defects, which were resolved by correspondence and other means of inquiry. All the statements and information contained in the Return, with the exception of the addresses of the owners, were derived from rating valuation lists for making assessments under the Poor Law, already held by every parish. Wealthy landowners were made thereby to pay a tax toward the upkeep of the poor.
Sources for Return.
Unlike the Domesday Book the 1873 Return was not based on original research by surveyors sent out across the country to visit every parish, but was merely an exercise of compiling already existing data held at parish level. The valuation lists of 1873 were prepared under the provisions of the Union Assessment Committee Act of 1862, which was introduced by the Right Hon. C. P. Villiers, the then President of the Poor Law Board. A short time before 1836 the Poor Law Commissioners had issued an order directing that the poor rate should contain certain particulars, but it was the Parochial Assessment Act of 1836 which contained the first statutory provision which required the poor rate to be made out in a prescribed manner. The 1862 Act provided for the appointment of an Assessment Committee by the Guardians of every Union for the investigation and supervision of the valuation of the several rateable properties in each parish within the Union for the purpose of assessment, and as a preliminary step to such investigation and supervision the overseers of every parish were required to make out a list of all the rateable properties in each parish, with the annual values thereof, in the following form: Name of Occupier; Name of Owner; Description of Property; Name or Situation of Property; Estimated Extent; Gross Estimated Rental; Rateable Value. There existed therefore in 1873 valuation lists in this form for every parish, except in the case of a few single parishes under separate Boards of Guardians to which the Union Assessment Committee Act did not apply.
Whilst the valuation lists of the various parishes were deposited with the clerks of the Unions, application was made to those officers to prepare and furnish the particulars for the 1873 Return, so far as regarded the parishes in their respective Unions, corrected as far as practicable from information within their reach, or which might be obtained from the parochial officers, with the addition of the addresses of the owners. Similar applications were made to the clerks to the guardians of single parishes not under the Union Assessment Committee Act.
Format.
The columns were headed from left: "Surname, Christian name, Acres, Rods, Perches, £, s"Areas are presented as A/R/P. A stands for acre of which there are 640 in 1 square mile. R refers to a rood which was a ploughing strip 220 yards long (1 furlong) and 5.5 yards wide (1 rod, pole or perch); 4 roods make 1 acre. P stands for a square pole, i.e. 30.25 square yards; 40 square poles comprise 1 rood. Rental is in £ (pound) and s (shilling); 20 shillings comprise £1. The £ s value given relates to the land's Gross Estimated Rental. Various problems were encountered in defining each of these main headings, as follows.
Names and addresses.
The following notes appear in the Explanatory Statement at start of Return:
The greatest difficulty was found as to these columns.
The parish lists are prepared only for the purposes of rating, and the material columns for the purpose of the assessments are those which contain the names of the occupiers and the statements of the gross estimated rental and rateable value of the property in each separate occupation. The latter statements are essential to show the basis upon which the rate is to be assessed and the sums to be paid, whilst the insertion of the names of the occupiers is required to point out the persons who are liable for the several amounts assessed.
With regard to the column as to the names of the owners, however, it must be observed that although the prescribed form both of the poor rates and the valuation lists indicates that the name of the owner of the property in each separate occupation should be inserted in it, the overseers who prepare the lists are not empowered, as in the case of the valuation lists prepared under the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, to require any return of the names of the owners to be made to them, either by the occupiers or any other persons, and probably neither the valuation lists nor the rates would be invalidated if the names of the owners were omitted altogether.
Nor is it easy, with the various tenures of property in this country, to lay down a precise rule as to what constitutes ownership.
Persons, for instance, holding property under very long leases may fairly be considered as owners; but then the question immediately arises, what length of lease is sufficient for this purpose.
There could be no question, as was said in the House of Lords, as to lessees for 999 years; and indeed lessees for shorter terms than that might properly be considered as owners.
A more difficult question arose as to lessees for 99 years, the common term of building leases, and also as to some other cases.
It was said on the one hand, that the holder of a building lease for 99 years, with occupying tenants under him, especially at the commencement of his term, might fairly be considered as an owner ; on the other that the holder of such a lease, when his term had nearly expired, could not be so considered. In some parts of England lands are frequently held on leases for lives constantly renewed, though without any right of renewal, and the lessees are generally treated as owners, though liable to be turned out on the expiration of the lives. Other cases of doubtful ownership might easily be suggested, and it became clear that only an arbitrary line could be drawn.
After much consideration it was determined that lessees for terms exceeding 99 years, or with a right of perpetual renewal, should be considered as owners, but that lessees for terms of shorter duration, or for lives, without a right of renewal, should not be so considered.
Instructions were issued to the Union Clerks to frame their Returns in accordance with this rule; but notwithstanding this direction, it is extremely probable that in several instances where properties have been held for long periods on beneficial leases or for lives, as is the case in some parts of England, the names of the lessees have been entered in the Return as owners, as neither the clerks nor the overseers would have had any reason to suppose that they were not the owners in fee.
In some of the Rating Acts the term "owner" means either the immediate lessor of the premises, or the person receiving the rent of the same "for the use of any corporation or any public company, or of any landlord or lessee who shall be a minor or married woman, or insane, or for the use of any person for whom he is acting as agent". It is obvious that such persons are not really the owners of the property, and directions were therefore given, that whenever it was within the knowledge of the clerk or the overseers that the names of trustees, receivers, or other persons not beneficially interested in the property were entered in the owners' column, the names of the actual owners, if ascertainable, should be substituted.
In the case of joint owners it is probable that in many cases one name only will have been returned as owner, though the clerks were directed, whenever the name and address of each owner could be ascertained, to insert them.
Moreover, the Act does not require any periodical revision of the valuation lists as under the Metropolis Valuation Act of 1869, and a mere change of ownership would not render the preparation of a supplemental valuation list, or the revision of an existing list necessary. In some cases it was found that the names of owners who had died several years ago had been retained. In one instance where a property had been sold in lots, it appeared that the names of the new owners had not been inserted in the valuation list, and the single name of the former owner was still in the list. In order to obviate the difficulty from this source, the clerks were directed, when they were aware that changes in ownership had taken place, to substitute the names of the present owners in the Returns, and to apply to the overseers or rate collectors to assist in revising the Returns before their final completion.
Although the foregoing remarks refer chiefly to the Owners column in the Valuation Lists, it should be stated that this column has been found to be filled up with still less accuracy in the rate books in those parishes where the Union Assessment Committee Act is not in force. This observation applies to several important towns, where, owing to the large number of separate occupations, and the fact that the rents are paid in numerous cases to lessees, trustees, or agents, the difficulties of ascertaining the names of the owners or ground landlords may be said to be almost insurmountable.
When the necessary particulars relating to all the Unions in each county had been received by the Local Government Board, it became the duty of that Department to arrange and consolidate the separate parish and union returns into one Return for the whole county, and in doing this a further difficulty arose.
In order to make a correct county Return, the name of each owner ought to appear only once, and all the property belonging to him within the county should be included under his name.
When, however, the same name appeared more than once in the several Union lists, the Board in London could not determine whether there were two or more persons with the same name, or whether the name of the same person was repeated.
For the purpose as far as possible of identifying the owners, it had been required that their names and addresses, when the latter could be ascertained, should be given in full and as accurately as possible.
Where the same name with the same address occurred more than once in the returns, it might be assumed as probable that the entries referred to the same person, but when the same name occurred with a different address, it was probable, though by no means certain, that different persons were intended. In all these cases it became necessary to communicate with the clerks of the several Unions in which the name appeared, to ascertain if it referred to the same or different persons ; thus, for example, the name of John Smith might appear in a county 12 times, and in as many different Unions, and inquiry had to be made in each Union to ascertain whether the name indicated one and the same person, or whether they were 12 separate persons of that name.
A reference to some of the Welsh counties, where there are large numbers of owners of the same Christian and surnames, e.g., the county of Cardigan, where the name David Davies occurs above 53 times, and John Jones above 70 times, will show the labour involved in this branch of the inquiry, and it may be added that, independently of other inquiries, upwards of 300,000 separate applications had to be sent to the clerks in order to clear up questions in reference to duplicate entries.
In some cases it has been found impracticable to discover the addresses of the owners, and whenever there is a single entry in the address column within brackets it must be understood to show the parish in which the . property is situate and not the residence of the owner; where there are two entries in the address column, one of them in brackets, it indicates that it has been ascertained that the two persons with the same address are two distinct persons.
Where the owners appear to be corporate bodies, or to hold their lands in virtue of a public office, the names are printed in italics; but the Return must not be assumed to be complete in this respect, as there is reason to believe that in many cases the name of an individual is entered instead of the body or office which he represents, and this remark applies especially to glebe lands.
Notwithstanding all the care that has been taken, there can be no doubt that in several cases the name of the same person will appear more than once in the county Return, but, on the other hand, there will be many cases in which only one name will appear as owner, although the property is really in several hands.
Estimated extents.
The following notes appear in the Explanatory Statement at start of Return:
The estimated extent of land in connexion with each assessment is probably taken, in most cases, either from some former rate or survey, or from the account given by the occupying tenant of the acreage of his holding. Extreme accuracy therefore could not be expected, and in many cases, especially in those of small properties, the acreage was found to be omitted altogether.
Where the acreage was not entered in the Valuation Lists, the clerks were requested to furnish the best estimate in their power; but there are instances in which the Board have been unable to obtain any sufficient information on this head, and in these cases the column is necessarily left blank.
It will doubtless be observed that a small acreage frequently represents a large rental, but this may arise either from the value of the land being increased by houses or other buildings upon it, or by the value of coal worked below its surface, or in some few cases by the absence of information as to the extent of a portion of the property. Instances will also be noticed of a large acreage being represented by a comparatively small rental; and the explanation of most of these will be found in the fact that a considerable portion of the land is of a mountainous, or similarly unproductive character. For "Waste" and Common land uncertainties arose. If they yield no profit they are not rated, and are not included in the valuation lists, and it is only where a parish map or survey has shown the extent of these lands that the clerk to the guardians or the parish officers could be expected to state the area accurately. In other cases an estimate, more or less conjectural, of the actual extent is all the information which could be obtained.
Gross estimated rental.
The following notes appear in the Explanatory Statement at start of Return:
The column in the Valuation Lists as to the gross estimated rental is necessarily filled up with more care, as it is the basis upon which the rateable value is determined. The amount appearing in the column of gross estimated rental in this Return under the name of each owner is the aggregate of the amounts appearing under his name in the various parochial Lists of the county.
It must, however, always be borne in mind that the amount of the gross estimated rental as shown in the parish Returns and consequently in this Return, is not the amount of the rent, payable to the person under whose name as owner it appears, but the amount of the entire rents which the occupying tenants of the whole property would be presumed to pay to their immediate lessors.
In the case of purely agricultural land, the column "gross estimated rental" is intended to show the rent at which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, the tenant undertaking to pay all usual tenant's rates and taxes and tithe commutation rentcharge, if any, and, in the case of agricultural land, the value contained in this column will probably be found not to differ widely from the actual rental of the owner.
In the case of house or mineral property, the case is totally different, and this column affords no criterion of the rents received by the owners. This is very obvious in the case of land let on building leases. The rent received by the owner is, generally speaking, a mere ground rent reserved from the person to whom the land was originally let, of which no account is contained in the valuation lists, whilst the rental shown in those lists is the estimated amount of rent payable by the occupying tenant to the person from whom he takes the house. The ground landlord may be in the receipt of a few pounds, whilst the estimated rent of the occupying tenants, which nevertheless appears in the rental column under the name of the ground landlord, may be many thousand pounds.
There will be considerable discrepancies in the Return in respect of the rental of the owners of house property, arising from the different modes in which the Valuation Lists have been prepared, and which it has been found quite impossible to correct.
In some cases all the property of one ground landlord, with the amount of the rent payable by the occupying tenants to their intermediate lessors, will appear under the single name of the ground landlord, and a large rental will appear under his name, very far indeed exceeding the amount which he himself receives. There must be in the Return several such cases of which the Local Government Board can have no knowledge; but five remarkable instances may be referred to in the cases of Sir John St. Aubyn and Sir L. Palk in Devonshire, Lord Calthorpe in Warwickshire, and the Duke of Norfolk and Sir John William Ramsden in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
In other cases the names of the lessees will have been entered as owners, or the lessees will have been included in the aggregate number of owners under an acre, and in these cases the number of owners, according to the definition of the word "owner" adopted in this Return, will have been unduly increased.
It is quite impossible, without considerable local knowledge, and a minute investigation into the returns of town parishes, which would occupy a very long time, to make the Return actually correct in this respect.
In like manner, where the land includes a coal mine which is leased to a company, the gross rental which appears in the parish lists may represent a sum considerably in excess of the sum which goes into the pockets of the landowner.
There are other matters in relation to the Return which require to be noticed.
Property which is not rated does not appear in the parish lists, and consequently not in this Return.
At the time when the Return was prepared the following kinds of property were not rateable :
1.Mines other than coal mines ; and with respect to coal mines, it must be observed that in those parishes where there are only underground workings, and no surface occupation with the mine, the valuation lists do not indicate the particular lands under which the workings are carried on, and consequently do not show the enhanced value of the land to the owner. 
2.Woods, except where they consist of or contain saleable underwood. 
No notice is taken in the Return of any property of these descriptions.
Comparison with Domesday Book.
The following notes appear in the Explanatory Statement at start of Return:
As the term " Domesday Book" has been frequently applied to the present Return, it may not be out of place to refer briefly to the celebrated Survey of the Kingdom which was made by command of the Conqueror, in order to show the different character of the two undertakings, and the different means resorted to in their compilation.
In the year 1085 serious apprehensions appear to have been entertained of an invasion of the kingdom by the Danes, and the difficulty which the King then experienced in putting the country into a satisfactory state of defence led him to form the notion of having a general survey made of the whole kingdom, so, as Sir Martin Wright observes, "to discover " the quantity of every man's fee, and to fix his homage," or, in other words, to ascertain the quantity of land held by each person, and the quota of military aid which he was bound to furnish in proportion to the extent of his holding.
To secure accuracy of results, Commissioners or King's Justiciaries (Legati Regis) were appointed with ample powers to ascertain " upon the oath of the several Sheriffs, Lords of Manors, Presbyters, Reeves, Bailiffs, or Villans, according to " the nature of the place, what was the name of the place, who held it in the time of the Confessor, who was the present " holder, how many hides of land there were in the manor, how many carrucates in demesne, how many homagers, how many " villans, how many cotarii, how many servi, what freemen, how many tenants in socage, what quanity of wood, how much " meadow and pasture, what mills and fish-ponds, how much added or taken away, what was the gross value in King " Edward's time, what the present value, and how much each free-man or soc-man had or has." All this was to be estimated—
1st, as the estate was held in the time of the Confessor; 2ndly, as it was bestowed by the King himself; and, 3rdly, as its value stood at the time of the survey.
All these particulars were ascertained for each county, the Commissioners sending in Returns (breviates) for each county separately, and from these Returns Domesday Book, or the General Register for the whole kingdom, was compiled.
It will be seen, therefore, that the object of the Conqueror's survey was to ascertain the amount of military service and other assistance upon which he could depend; and that for this purpose he instituted an inquiry of a very searching and inquisitorial character into the nature and extent of the landed possessions of his subjects, sending special Commissioners into every locality, with power to summon the inhabitants and compel them to make a full disclosure of their property on oath.
Notwithstanding, however, these stringent measures for insuring accuracy, there is no doubt that the Commissioners did not always obtain or furnish correct information, and that sometimes, as in the case of the present Return, the statements of what we should now designate as the " Gross Estimated Rental," and the " Estimated Extent," are not altogether reliable. Ingulph, the historian of Croyland, in referring to the survey of the possessions of that abbey, expressly says, " Isti" (taxatores) " penes nostrum monasterium benevoli et amantes non ad verum pretium nec ad verum " spatium nostrum monasterium librabant, misericorditer praecaventes in futurum exactionibus et aliis oneribus, piisima " nobis benevolentia providentes."—Oxford edition, p. 79.
With respect to the result of this inquiry, so far as it discloses the number of landowners existing at that time, it must be observed that although the Domesday Book may be considered as a fair record of the number of persons having a direct interest in land, it is almost impossible, owing to the different designations under -which they are classified, to distinguish those who may properly be considered as owners from those who were in the possession of land as mere occupiers only.
The following estimate, which is extracted from the work of Sir H. Ellis, may perhaps be taken as showing proximately the number of persons who can properly be regarded as having claim to be considered as holders of land upon some legally recognized tenure :
Total of recorded landholders: 54,813
The Burgenses, or Burgesses, who were returned as 7,968, are not included in the above list, as it is impossible to distinguish those who held lands in their individual from those who held in a corporate capacity, and many of them were evidently not owners in any sense of the term.
Moreover the Villeins, of whom there were 108,407, are omitted, because it is quite certain that, when they occupied small portions of land, they did so on sufferance only. In fact they were regarded as mere chattels, which could be bought or sold, and they were not allowed by law to acquire any property, either in land or in goods.
It should be added that the present counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham were not included in the survey.
England & Wales.
The Return was published commercially in 1875 and sold for 10s 6d in two leather-bound volumes edited by John Lambert as "England and Wales (Exclusive of the Metropolis): Return of Owners of Land, 1873; Presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty; London, printed by George Edward Eyre and William Spottiswoode. Printers to the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty. For her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1875"
Scotland.
The Scottish Return was published in 1874 as: "Scotland: Owners of Lands and Heritages 17 & 18 Vict., Cap. 91, 1872–3 Return:
I: Of the name and address of every owner of one acre and upwards in extent (outside the municipal boundaries of boroughs containing more than 20,000 inhabitants) with the estimated acreage and the annual value of the land and heritages of individual owners. And iof the number of owners of less than one acre with the estimated aggregate acreage and annual value of the lands and heritage of such owners in each county
II: A similar return for municipal boroughs containing more than 20,000 inhabitants.
Presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty; Edinburgh: Printed by Murray and Gibb, printers to Her Majesty's Stationmery Office, 1874"
Ireland.
In 1873, the Local Government Board in Ireland set about to ascertain the number and names of owners of land of one acre and upwards in Ireland. Clerks of the various Poor Law Unions were called upon to draw up lists of such persons from the property valuation and rate books in their custody. The lists were returned to the Local Government Board by the end of 1875, arranged into counties, alphabetized, and finally published in 1876 in 200 pages under the title Return of Owners of Land of One Acre and Upwards, in the Several Counties, Counties of Cities, and Counties of Towns in Ireland.
Popularity.
The publication of the Return had a serious political purpose yet it became sought after reading amongst society in general, not least amongst the landed classes themselves. Bateman in the preface to his 1883 work (see below) summarised the situation as follows:
"That the affairs of one's neighbours are of no 
little interest to men of every class of life has 
perhaps never been more strongly proved than 
by the production of and great demand for "The 
Modern Domesday Book." Not only have Mr. Frederick 
Purdy and others analyzed it, Mr. Lyulph Stanley 
abused it, Mr. John Bright moved its digestion in the House, and the "Spectator" and other London journals scathingly criticised it, but the immense herd of country newspapers have actually reproduced it, as far as their own neighbourhoods are concerned, in their columns, much, probably, to the satisfaction of the bulk of readers, to whom 
twenty-six shillings (the price of the English volumes alone) is prohibitory. As an example of this, I may mention, that having a small party in my house during one of those dubious weeks which come in 'twixt the close of the hunting and the beginning of the London season, I was saved all Marthean cares as to the amusement of my guests simply by leaving about on the table the two huge 
volumes of " The Modern Domesday," over which I found bowed with the utmost constancy two or more heads. I heard from one of my guests that the copy of the work at the "Ultratorium" was reduced to rags and tatters within a fortnight of its arrival a lesson which was not wasted on the library committee of my own club, who caused the book to be so bound as to defy anything short of a twelve -year-old school-boy".
Corrected & derivative editions.
John Bateman FRGS (1839–1910) published in 1876 "The Acre-Ocracy of England", based on the 1873 Return. In 1883, under the Harrison imprint, he issued a corrected and edited version of the 1873 Return, which in many instances differs very significantly from the original. He listed the commonest sources of error in his preface. The fourth and last edition of his work was entitled: "The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, A list of all owners of Three thousand acres and upwards, worth £3,000 a year; Also, one thousand three hundred owners of Two thousand acres and upwards, in England, Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, their acreage and income from Land, Culled from "The Modern Domesday Book"". It was republished in 1971 by the Leicester University Press, New York, using text from the 1883 edition, and had an introduction by David Spring.

Katharina Paldauf

Katharina Paldauf (born about 1625 in Fürstenfeld; died probably 23 September 1675), born Fondell, was the wife of the keeper of the Riegersburg Castle and the most prominent victim of the Great Witch trial of Feldbach (1673–1675). As a so-called "flower witch" in Riegersburg after her death she was known far beyond her home region.
Life.
Katharina Paldauf was born about 1625. At 20, she entered the service of Elisabeth Katharina Freifrau von Galler († 1672), the owner of the Riegersburg Castle. There, she met her future husband Johann Simon Paldauf, who was employed by the "bad Liesl", as the lady of the castle was popularly known as castle keeper (administrator). The couple had at least three children: Katharina, Anna and Ferdinand.
In the spring of 1675, when Katharina was about 50 years old she was accused of having manipulated weather and participated in witch Sabbaths, arrested and incarcerated in Feldbach. Though she initially denied the accusations, after being tortured she confessed and gave the name of other people that participated in witch meetings. She was found guilty and sentenced to death. She probably died on 23 September 1675. She was first killed and then burnt to the stake.

Margaret Bernadine Hall

Margaret Bernadine Hall (1863 – 2 January 1910) was an English artist who spent most of her career in Paris. Few of her works have survived, but she is notable for her painting "Fantine", which hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, England. The subject of the painting is Fantine, a character in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Misérables".
Biography.
Margaret Bernadine Hall was born in 1863 in Wavertree, Liverpool. Her father was Bernard Hall (1813–90), a merchant, local politician and philanthropist, who was elected Mayor of Liverpool in 1879. Her mother was Margaret Calrow (1827–1902) from Preston, Lancashire, who was Bernard Hall's second wife. Margaret was their second child, and their oldest daughter. In 1882 the family moved to London, and later that year, at the age of 19, Margaret moved to Paris to study art for 5 years at the academy run by Auguste Feyen-Perrin and Eduard Krug. This was at a time when there were few female artists in the city, and when the Impressionists were active. Between 1888 and 1894 Hall travelled extensively to countries including Japan, China, Australia, North America, and North Africa, returning to Paris in 1894. She moved back to England in 1907, where she died three years later at the home of the playwright George Calderon in Hampstead Heath, London. Following her death, her estate was valued at £22,130 
(£ as of ). Margaret Bernadine Hall was buried in the churchyard of All Saints' Church, Childwall, Liverpool, and there is a brass memorial tablet to her in the north aisle of the church. In 1925 a retrospective exhibition of her paintings was held in Chelsea, London.
Works.
Most of Hall's paintings have disappeared. In addition to "Fantine", it is known that she painted "Les Abandonées", and "Le Pauvre Père", all of which were studies in social realism. In 1885 "Les Abandonées" was exhibited in the Paris Salon. "Fantine" was painted in the following year, the year after Victor Hugo died, and it received an honourable mention from the Société des Femmes Peintres. In 1887 Hall's paintings were shown at exhibitions in Vienna, Chicago, London and Manchester. What happened to most of the paintings after Hall's death is not known. In 1910 her brother Sir Douglas Bernard Hall offered "Fantine" and "Les Abandonées" to the National Gallery, London, but they were declined. During the following year he offered them to the Walker Art Gallery, and "Fantine" was accepted. There are two other known extant paintings by Hall. In Trinity College, Cambridge is a portrait entitled "Sedley Taylor (1834–1920), Music Scholar and Benefactor", which was painted in 1898. The other painting came to light in 2011; it is in private ownership, and is a portrait of her brother, Sir Douglas Bernard Hall, with an estimated date of 1884. The only other known surviving works from the hand of Margaret Bernadine Hall are five copies she made of paintings by Murillo, Raphael, Veronese, and Ribalta, commissioned by the Sisters of the Chapel of the Transfiguration in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

A nonsectarian spiritual movement, it is based on the Japanese Gedatsukai, a new religious movement that was founded in 1929 by Japanese Gedatsu Kongo. The Church preaches about Gedatsu, a religious study that does not exclude any religions and beliefs. Gedatsu is the Japanese term for moksha or enlightenment.
Establishment.
Gedatsu Kongo, the founder of Gedatsu Church of America, was born in Japan in 1881. According to the Church, Kongo received a revelation from God at the age of 48. He established Gedatsu Church in 1929, devoting himself to leading people to spiritual awakening, enlightenment and peace until his demise in 1948.

İnkılâpçı

İnkılâpçı ("Revolutionary") was a weekly newspaper in Cyprus, closed in 1955.
History.
İnkılâpçı "(Revolutionary)" was first published on 13 September 1955.
The newspaper would be published for 15 weeks, in that period of time being viewed as the voice of the working classes; it published articles regarding all of the important social and economical subjects of those days. But after the British colonial administration declared and emergency situation on 14 December 1955, the newspaper was closed together with 'Neos Democratis', the daily newspaper of AKEL. Initially AKEL, and then the leftist villager's, socialist youth and women's organizations were outlawed, with many leftists arrested and imprisoned.
As it can be understood from the article under the title ""Threat"", published in the last issue of İnkılâpçı on 12 December 1955, the then Turkish Cypriot leadership and its underground organisations sent letters of threat to the publishing team of İnkılâpçı, bearing passages such as ""stop the publication of İnkılâpçı, you will be killed, your heads will be crushed"".
Several years after the closure of the newspaper, its former editor, Fazıl Önder, was assassinated on 24 May 1958 by the TMT. Hulus İbrahim, the co-founder of İnkılâpçı, fled to London to save his life on the same day of Önder's death.

The Berlin Patient

The Berlin patient is a phrase that has been used on two distinct and unrelated occasions to describe a person who has received a functional cure for HIV in Berlin, Germany. The first Berlin patient was described in 1998. After receiving an experimental therapy, the patient, who has remained anonymous, has maintained nearly undetectable levels of HIV and has remained off antiretroviral therapy. The second Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, was described in 2008. He received a stem cell transplant from a donor naturally resistant to HIV and has remained off antiretroviral therapy.
Timothy Ray Brown: the 2008 Berlin patient.
The most famous Berlin patient is Timothy Ray Brown. He is originally from Seattle, Washington. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1995 and began antiretroviral therapy. In 2006, Timothy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). His physician, Dr. Gero Hütter, at Charité Hospital in Berlin, arranged for him to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a donor with the CCR5 delta32 mutation. This mutation, found at relatively high frequencies in Northern Europeans, results in a mutated CCR5 protein. The majority of HIV cannot enter a human cell without a functional CCR5 gene. An exception to this is a small minority of viruses that use alternate receptors, such as CXCR4 or CCR2. Those individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5 mutation are resistant to HIV and rarely progress to AIDS. Timothy received two stem cell transplants from one donor homozygous for the delta32 mutation: one in 2007 and one in 2008. In 2009, after being off antiretroviral therapy for one year, levels of HIV plummeted while his CD4 T cell count increased, indicating that he no longer needed antiretroviral therapy to control his HIV infection. The results were published in the "New England Journal of Medicine". Today, he remains off antiretroviral therapy and is considered cured. In 2012, Timothy Ray Brown created a foundation to fund HIV cure research.
Anonymous: the 1998 Berlin patient.
The first Berlin patient was a German in his mid-twenties. He was a patient of Dr. Heiko Jessen in Berlin, Germany. He was diagnosed with acute HIV infection in 1996. He was prescribed an unusual combination therapy: didanosine, indinavir and hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea was the most unusual of the three, as it is a cancer drug not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HIV treatment. The combination was part of a small trial Dr. Jessen was testing in patients during acute HIV infection. After several treatment interruptions, the patient went off the prescribed therapy completely. The virus became almost undetectable. The patient has remained off antiretroviral therapy. In 2014 a follow-up report in NEJM suggest that the patient most likely controlled HIV because of the genetic background and not because of the particular treatment he received during acute HIV infection.
Research studies inspired by the Berlin patients.
Numerous research studies have been stimulated by the two cases of the Berlin patients. These include gene therapy approaches to HIV inspired by the case of Timothy Ray Brown, and HIV eradication and early therapy inspired by the case of the first Berlin patient. The stories of both Berlin patients and the science they have shaped are told in a book scheduled for release in 2014: "Cured: How the Berlin Patients Defeated HIV and Forever Changed Medical Science."
