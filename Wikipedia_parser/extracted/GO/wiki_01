The Family Friend (magazine)

The Family Friend was a magazine published in book form in England for much of the 19th century. It was a compendium of articles considered entertaining and useful, and was aimed mainly at the housewife of the day. 
Content.
Included were articles on cooking, diet, lacemaking, patterns, embroidery, scientific discoveries, the latest explorations of the world, advice on planting and maintaining trees and vegetables, breeding birds and animals, household tips, parenting advice, spiritual reflections and dramatic fiction. The format was varied as well, presenting prose, song, poetry, clothing patterns, and sundry other items of interest. 
The advice on diet and medicine was a mixture of the sound and the completely inaccurate. One of the more popular features was the inclusion of serialized novels, most of which concerned women and were essentially morality tales. One such was 'Katharine, a Tale of Women's Trials,' by Mrs Burbury (no, 1, vol 7, 1854). Also popular were sentimental poems accompanied by engravings, often of ruined abbeys and castles. The Family Friend gives insight into the general tone of Victorian households' interests and activities, and is an accurate source for authors and filmmakers of costume design and other period details.
Duration and circulation.
"The Family Friend" was published every month by S. W. Partridge and Company of London, from 1849 to 1921. At its height, this magazine had a circulation of about 50,000.

Beasley Mounds Site

The Beasley Mounds Site (40SM43) (also known as the Dixon Springs Mound Site) is a Mississippian culture archaeological site located at the confluence of Dixon Creek and the Cumberland River near the unincorporated community of Dixon Springs in Smith County, Tennessee. The site was first excavated by amateur archaeologists in the 1890s. More examples of Mississippian stone statuary have been found at the site than any other in the Middle Tennessee area. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.
Site.
The Beasley site was a large village area with one large platform mound in height and in diameter and three smaller ones. The first of the smaller mounds was located east of the larger mound and was high and in diameter. The other two mounds were located to the south and southeast of this mound and were both about to in height and about in diameter. The site was surrounded by a low embankment with regular rises thought to have once been a wooden defensive palisade with bastions. Located outside the palisade on a steep bluff overlooking the Cumberland were two small stone mounds, similar to ones found at the Castalian Springs and Sellars Mound sites. In this area several large stone box graves and mortuary caves have also been found.
Excavations.
The site was excavated in 1895 by Sam Stone Bush, an amateur archaeologist and friend of William E. Myer. Myer supplied the only description of the site from this period, important now because much of the site has been leveled and farmed extensively since then. no modern excavations have taken place at the site, making it one of the most poorly studied burial centers in the Middle Cumberland Valley.
Important finds.
Bush's excavations at the site produced stone pipes, stone discoidals used for the game of chunkey and numerous examples of Mississippian culture pottery specific to the Nashville Basin area. This pottery, Matthew Incised var. "Matthews", gives a rough chronology for the sites occupation as belonging to the 1300s up to the early 1400s CE. In 1898 a farmer plowing fields on the site discovered five stone statues and the fragment of the head of another all within a area just from the main platform mound. This area is theorized by archaeologists to have been the location of a large civic or mortuary structure. All of the statues and fragments were later acquired by Myers. Another statue, number 7, was also plowed from the same location at some time prior to 1923, which Myer also subsequently acquired. After his death Myers widow sold four of the statues to the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1927 and are now part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. This is the largest collection of Mississippian stone statues found in the Middle Tennessee area.

SME Rating Agency of India

SMERA Ratings Ltd (SMERA) is a third party rating agency exclusively set up for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) in India for ratings on creditworthiness. It provides ratings which enable MSME units to raise bank loans at competitive rates of interest.
However, its registration with Securities Exchange Board of India SEBI as a Credit Rating Agency and accreditation by Reserve Bank of India RBI in September 2012 as an external credit assessment institution (ECAI) to rate bank loan ratings under Basel II guidelines has paved way for SMERA to rate/grade various instruments such as: IPO, Bonds, Security Receipts, Bank Loan Instruments etc. In addition to this, RBI has told that Banks may use ratings of SME Rating Agency of India (SMERA), in addition to grades provided by other agencies, to assign risks to loans for the purpose of computing capital adequacy requirements. 
History.
The agency was founded in 2005 by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India Private Limited (D&B) and several leading Govt., Public, Private and MNC banks in the country...
Achievements.
1) SMERA has pioneered SME ratings in the country and has till date completed over 23,000 ratings across sectors and geographies on a PAN – India basis.

<doc id="30926281" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30926281" title="Lower Yangtze Mandarin">
Lower Yangtze Mandarin

Lower Yangtze or "Xiajiang" Mandarin, also called Jiang-Huai Mandarin after the Yangtze (Jiang) and Huai Rivers, is one of the most divergent of the Mandarin dialects, as it neighbors the Wu, Hui, and Gan Chinese languages.
Features and location.
67 million people speak Jianghuai Mandarin. Some features of Jianghua Mandarin include retention of Middle Chinese syllable-final stops.
The Portuguese Chinese Dictionary (PCD) written by missionaries during the Ming dynasty categorized several Jianghuai dialects with rounded finals. The eastern and southeastern variants of Jianghuai contain these rounded finals, Nanjing dialect, on the other hand, is located in another group.
Lower Yangtze Mandarin is spoken in parts of Anhui and Hubei provinces north of the Yangtze, as well as some areas of Jiangsu north of the river, most notably in the former capital of Nanjing, as well as Jiujiang in Jiangxi province. It is one of the few Mandarin dialects to retain the entering tone (ru sheng 入聲) of Middle Chinese (as a final glottal stop) like the Jin dialect, and for this retention of the entering tone Jianghuai is compared to its non-Mandarin neighbors to the south. The retension of the rusheng is considered a unique feature of Jianghuai which sets it apart from other the other Mandarin dialects. It has largely lost initial "n", replacing it with "l".
Some Jianghuai dialects have five tones due to the preservation of the rù tone of Middle Chinese, more than four toned Standard Mandarin which lost the rù tone.
In Jianghuai, verbs which meant "to share, to gather, to mix, to accompany" gave rise to disposal markers which mean "and, with" like 跟Gen.
Jiangsu province contains the border in which Jianghuai and Northern Mandarin are split.
Jianghuai Mandarin shares some characteristics with Ming dynasty Southern Mandarin.
Peking opera got its start in parts of Anhui and Hubei which spoke this dialect.
Literary and colloquial readings.
The existence of literary and colloquial readings (文白异读), is a notable feature in Jianghuai Mandarin.
Relations to other dialects.
A linguist named Cheng evaluated the extent of relationship between dialects by using Pearson's correlation coefficients. The result was that Eastern dialects of Jianghuai "cluster", with the Xiang and Gan dialects when using a 35 world list, while Northern and Southern Mandarin were nowhere in the cluster with Eastern Jianghuai, while Northern and Southern were supposedly "genetic" relatives of Jianghuai Mandarin.
Jianghuai originally included the Huizhou dialect, but it is currently classified separately from Jianghuai.
Jianghuai Mandarin shares an "old literary layer" as a stratum with southern dialects like Minnan, Hakka, Gan, and Hangzhou dialects, which it does not share with Northern Mandarin. Sino Vietnamese also shares some of these characteristics. The stratum in Minnan specifically consist of Zeng group and Geng group's "n" and "t" finals when an "i" initial is present.
A professor of Chinese at Rutgers University, Richard Vanness Simmons, claims that the Hangzhou dialect, rather than being Wu as it was classified by Yuen Ren Chao, is a Mandarin dialect closely related to Jianghuai Mandarin. Hangzhou dialect is still classified under Wu. Chao had developed a "Common Wu Syllabary" for the Wu dialects. Simmons claimed that had Chao compared Hangzhou dialect to the Wu syllabary and Jianghuai mandarin, he would have found more similarities to Jianghuai.
Some works of literature produced in Yangzhou, such as Qingfengzha, a novel, contain Jianghuai Mandarin. People in Yangzhou identified by the dialect they speak, locals spoke the dialect, as opposed to sojourners, who spoke dialects like Huizhou or Wu. This led to the formation of identity based on dialect. Large amounts of merchants from Huizhou lived in Yangzhou and effectively were responsible for keeping the town afloat.
67 million people speak Jianghuai Mandarin. Some features of Jianghua Mandarin include retention of Middle Chinese syllable final stops. Like Wu, the glottal stop has superseded the original Middle Chinese p, t, k, and three-way place contrast has also gone extinct.
Some Chinese linguists like Ting have claimed that Jianghuai is mostly Wu containing a superstratum of Mandarin.
The linguist Dan Xu suggested that Jianghuai Mandarin is an intermediary with Standard Mandarin and Wu dialect regarding the occurrence of postpositions in Chinese dialects.
The Chinese Academy of Social Science was behind the separation of the Hui dialects from the Jianghuai Mandarin dialects in 1987.
Hefei, and other Jianghuai mandarin dialects, along with Taiyuan and other Jin dialects has gone through the process of a glottal stop replacing consonant endings. While most Mandarin dialects and the Wenzhou dialect have completely dropped Middle Chinese stop endings such as p, t, k, Jianghuai Mandarin, Jin, and Wu dialect converted them into a glottal stop. Having a single entering tone with a glottal stop is shared by Jin, Mandarin, and Wu dialects.
Vocalic distinctions are more common in Jianghuai Mandarin than the Jin Chinese.
The linguist Matthew Y. Chen noted that since the CVq syllables which are related to Middle Chinese ton IV are preserved in Jianghuai Mandarin that splitting Jin Chines from Mandarin on the basis that Middle Chinese tone IV was preserved in Jin made no sense. He did note that there was a separate reason to split Jin from Northern Mandarin, since it has a unique tone sandhi.
When Jianghuai Mandarin and Wu were compared to dialects from China's southeastern coast, it was concluded "that chain-type shifts in Chinese follow the same general rules as have been revealed by Labov for American and British English dialects."
Comparison to other Mandarin dialects.
Jianghuai Mandarin is related to the other dialects of Mandarin. Jianghuai Mandarin belongs to the Mandarin supergroup, and is one of the eight Mandarin subgroups. The other seven subgroups of Mandarin are "Northeastern, Beijing, Beifang, Jiaoliao, Zhongyuan, Lanyin, Southwestern" Other linguists classify Jin, Jianghuai, Northeastern, Northern, and Southwestern as five groups of Mandarin. Some linguists use three major groups to classify Mandarin, in total eight subdialects are included in the three major groups, one of which is Jianghuai. Linguists used the stopped tone category's reflexes to classify Mandarin into its various different groups. The most often accepted groups include Jianghuai as one of them, the other being Central Plains and Southwestern Mandarin. Another scheme classifies Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern, and Jiang-huai Mandarin into 4 groups of Mandarin.
Jianghuai (eastern) Mandarin and Northern Mandarin do not share many words; frequently many Jianghuai Mandarin words have no Northern Mandarin cognates, besides cognates that do exist between the two Mandarins have multiple forms.
The Rugaohua dialect of Jianghuai does not follow the T3 sandhi rule which most other Mandarin dialects follow, with T3 being absent from it. Linguists speculate that the Beijing dialect also eliminated T3 sandhi, but it was resurrected for modern Standard Mandarin (Putonghua).
Nanjing Jianghuai Mandarin has preserved the glottal stop as a final and separates the entering tone unlike Northern Mandarin or Southwestern Mandarin, like Northern Mandarin, it keeps the retroflex initials. In Jianghuai Mandarin, the n sound does not exist, being pronounced as L; the opposite occurred in Southwestern Mandarin, where now only the n sound is present while L merged into it. Northern Mandarin on the other hand, keeps both n and L separate. Jianghuai, like Northern Mandarin, also separates the F and X sound in "xu", while in Southwestern Mandarin, X merged into f so that it is pronounced as "fu". In Jianghuai, əŋ has "merged" into iŋ, while the opposite has occurred in Southwestern Mandarin, Northern Mandarin keeps both as separate sounds.
The two finals ŋ and n are the only ones that exist in dialects of Mandarin. The final stops merged into a glottal stop in Jianghuai Mandarin, while in the majority of southwestern Mandarin they are completely eliminated, Northern and Northwest Mandarin have undergone both changes in their varieties of dialects. Nanjing Mandarin is an exception to the normal occurrence of the i, y and u medials in Mandarin, along with is eastern Shanxi and some southwest Mandarin dialects.
Verbs meaning giving function as a passive agent marker or a disposal construction direct object marker in the Zhongyuan, Jianghuai, and southwestern Mandarin. This is also shared by the grammatization of "gei" 给 in Standard Mandarin, since all four are Mandarin dialects.
When Chinese people were subjected to listening to various dialects such as Northern Mandarin (Yantai dialect), Standard Mandarin (Putonghua), and Jianghuai Mandarin (Rugao dialect of Jiangsu), "cross dialectal" differences appeared in their reactions.
Prominence.
Jianghuai Mandarin was possibly the native tone of the founding Emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang and many of his military and civil officials.
The "Guanhua koine" of the early Ming era was based on Jianghuai Guanhua (Jianghuai Mandarin). Western missionaries and Korean Hangul writings of the Ming Guanhua and Nanjing dialect showed differences, which pointed to the Guanhua being a koine and mixture of various dialects strongly based on Jianghuai.
In Matteo Ricci's "Dicionário Português-Chinês", words in this dictionary documenteed the Ming dynasty Mandarin. A number of words appeared to be derived from Jianghuai Mandarin dialect, such as "pear, jujube, shirt, ax, hoe, joyful, to speak, to bargain, to know, to urinate, to build a house, busy, and not yet."
Some linguists have studied the influence which Nanjing Jianghuai Mandarin had on Ming dynasty guanhua/Mandarin. Although the early Ming dynasty Mandarin/Guanhua was a koine based on Nanjing dialect, it was not entirely identical to it, with some non Jianghuai characteristics being found in it. Francisco Varo advised that to learn Chinese one must acquire it from "Not just any Chinese, but only those who have the natural gift of speaking the Mandarin language well, such as those natives of the Province of Nan king, and of other provinces where the Mandarin tongue is spoken well.
Jianghuai Mandarin, along with Northern Mandarin, formed the standard for Baihua before and during the Qing dynasty up till its replacement by modern Standard Mandarin. This Baihua was used by writers all over China regardless of the dialect they spoke. Chinese writers who spoke other dialects had to use the grammar and vocabulary of Jianghuai and Northern Mandarin in order for the majority of Chinese to understand their writing, by contrast, Chinese who did not speak southern dialects would not be able to understand a Southern dialect's writing.
Jianghuai also influenced the Beijing dialect. The Beijing dialect was only influenced by various northern dialects, but also from Jianghuai.
Dialect has also been used as a tool for regional identitity and politics in the Jiangbei and Jiangnan regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the "backwater". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided to no longer speak Jianghuai Mandarin, which was the dialect of Yangzhou. They instead replaced Mandarin with Wu and spoke Taihu Wu dialects. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.
History of expansion.
Evidence from the Eastern Han dynasty period suggests the southern dialects included Jianghuai.
During the Han dynasty, Old Chinese was divided into dialects, one of them was called "Chǔ-Jiāng-huái", 憐 lián meant "to love" in this dialect.
The original dialect of Nanjing was the Wu dialect in the Eastern Jin. After the Wu Hu uprising, the Jin Emperor and many northern Chinese fled south. The new capital of Eastern Jin was created at Jiankang, where modern day Nanjing is today, it was during this time that the Nanjing dialect started to transform into Jianghuai Mandarin from Wu. Further events, such as Hou Jing's rebellions during the Liang dynasty and the Sui dynasty invasion of the Chen dynasty resulted in Jiankang's destruction, during the Ming dynasty, Ming Taizu relocated southerners from below Yangzi and made Nanjing the capital, and during the Taiping Rebellion, Taiping rebels seized Nanjing and made it the capital of the Taiping Kingdom, the fighting resulted in the loss of the population of Nanjing. These events all played in role in forming the Nanjing dialect of today.
Immigrants from Northern China during the middle of the Song dynasty moved south, bringing a speech type from which Northern Wu and Jianghuai reading patterns both derive from, these northern immigrants almost totally took over from the original inhabitants on the Yangtze's northern bank. Jiang-huai, like other dialects of Chinese has two forms for pronouncing words, the Bai (common, vulgar), and the Wen (literary), the Bai forms appear to preserve more ancient forms of speech dating from before the mass migration in the Song dynasty which brought in the wen pronunciations.
During the Ming dynasty Wu speakers moved into Jianghuai speaking regions, influencing the Tairu and Tongtai dialects of Jianghuai.
In the Ming and Qing dynasties Jianghuai speakers moved into Hui dialect areas.
Jianghuai Mandarin is currently overtaking Wu dialect as the language of multiple counties in Jiangsu. An example of this is Zaicheng Town in Lishui County, both Jianghuai and Wu dialect were spoken in several towns in Lishui, with Wu being spoken by the greater amount of people in more towns than Jianghuai. The Wu dialect is called "old Zaicheng Speech", while Jianghuai dialect is called "new Zaicheng speech", with Wu dialect being driven rapidly to extinction. Only old people use it to talk to relatives. The Jianghuai dialect was present there since about a century, even though all the surrounding areas around the town are Wu speaking. Jianghuai was always confined inside the town itself until the 60's, in the present it is overtaking Wu.
Subdialects.
It is divided into three main branches, with several subbranches:
Of unclear placement in the classification above:
The Wuchang, Wuhan, and Tianmen dialects are spoken around the Chang-jiang lakes.
Taixing dialect. Taixing dialect uses the character "na" for "disposal construction".
Anqing dialect.
Tongcheng dialect (桐城话)
"Tongdao, Ningyuan, Longshan, Yizhang, Zhijiang" are also all Jianghuai Mandarin dialects.

<doc id="30926315" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30926315" title="El Grande (tree)">
El Grande (tree)

El Grande was a massive "Eucalyptus" ("Eucalyptus regnans") in Tasmania and Australia's largest tree. It was located on a ridge in the upper Derwent valley, adjacent to the World Heritage Area of the Florentine Valley, approximately from Hobart. The tree stood in height, had a girth of , and a volume of 439 cubic metres. While it was not the tallest tree in Australia, it was considered to be the largest in terms of volume, and the world's biggest flowering plant.
Approximately 350 years old, it was burned in April 2003, and died in December 2003, as the result of catching fire in a burn-off of the debris remaining after the clear-felling of old growth forest in the tree's immediate vicinity. Australian forestry officials admitted responsibility for killing the tree. Its hollow trunk acted like a furnace so that it was cooked from the inside.
The death of the tree, which had already been used as a symbol in the Wilderness Society's campaign against logging, brought national and international media attention. The destruction of El Grande became a symbol for the destruction of Tasmanian forests. Scrutiny intensified the use of Tasmania's forests for wood chip exportation, and the processes involved.
In the later half of 2003, Forestry Tasmania decided to remove individual names from the state's giant trees, but later relented. Other giant trees in the area of El Grande which are also protected by Forestry Tasmania’s Giant Trees Policy, have since been named Centurion, which was discovered in 2008, and Triarius. Trees in the vicinity that had been named previously by the Wilderness Society include the Chapel tree and Gandalf's Staff.

Early life and education.
Jill Orr completed a Higher Diploma of Secondary Art and Craft Teaching, at Melbourne College of Advanced Education in 1975. In 1994 Orr received a Masters of Arts in Fine Art at Royal Melbourne University of Technology, and in 2006, Orr commenced a PHD in Art and Design, at Monash University.
Major works.
"Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters - Goya ".
Performed at both Artspace, Sydney (2002), and fortyfivedownstairs, Melbourne (2003)
The title taken from an etching by Goya, the master of depicting the extremes of humanity. The work refers to the post-11 September world, the beginning of the war in Iraq, and the continuing plight of refugees imprisoned in Australian detention centres. The performance highlighted the ongoing death, maiming and destruction of civil liberties that holds sway through clashing belief systems, in the name of the ‘War on Terror’.
The performance was constructed with two adjoining darkened rooms; one to exhibit shadowy images on a single screen projection, and the other containing 4 light sensitive paintings. The lighting in one of the rooms cycled between dull spot lighting to total darkness for 60 seconds, which then the only light source is from the illuminosity of the 4 paintings. 
Orr became a part of the installation; a contained creature twitching and jerking in the dark. Orr’s character explored the confines of the rooms, while assembling bones into sculptural pieces, some which became body adornments. The performance was an eight-hour endurance event in which sculptures were created from a tonne of animal meat and bones. Orr chose animal remains as an allegory to point out the parallel between our own bodies, and to show to the fabricated depictions of horrific human suffering which are witnessed, through media on a daily basis.

Ivan Pozharsky

<doc id="30926578" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30926578" title="Self-stereotyping">
Self-stereotyping

The term self-stereotyping was coined as part of self-categorization theory and describes a process by which a perceiver will come to see themselves in a way more consistent with stereotypes about their in-group than they otherwise would. Self-stereotyping may be seen as an outcome of depersonalization, where the self is viewed as a categorically interchangeable member of the salient ingroup.
Although at any given time, people’s active self-concept is a mix of situational-triggered and chronically accessible identities, self-stereotyping causes the active self-concept to more closely resemble stereotypes about one’s salient in-group. For instance, with self-stereotyping an in-group member may begin to identify with the group by acting in a stereotypic way, specific to that in-group. By exhibiting these characteristics, the individual feels more in tune with the needs and attitudes of the group.
The growth of one’s personal social identity can directly affect the decline in personal identity. A person’s sense of conforming to group goals and the identity perceived of the group essentially become more important when it comes to guiding beliefs and behaviors. In this distinction, a self-stereotype reflects the views placed on a general group which is accepted by a group member.
Studies.
The work of Latrofa et al. supports this theory through research on the cognitive process that initiates self-stereotyping behaviors. In their research, they found that low-status group members are more likely to be influenced by stereotypical traits of higher-ranking group members and begin to exhibit these characteristics both negatively and positively, whereas, high-ranking group members are more likely to identify with personal characteristics.
Some researchers have found that self-stereotyping is somewhat dependent upon an individual’s belief that he/she and the group are capable of change. If the individual believes that the group is not similar to the needs of the individual, the individual will then adapt to his/her own personality traits in order to maintain membership within the in-group. If the in-group is flexible to change the personalities of its members, an individual is more likely to maintain his/her self-image and avoid self-stereotyping. These researchers also found that individuals tend to adapt to group characteristics more readily if they see this change as an enhancement to the self. Therefore, the outlook an individual has on a group influences how much the individual is willing to sacrifice to become a member of the group.

None of Windsor's tallest buildings are among the tallest in Canada, but are generally taller than the tallest buildings in the Windsor's nearby neighbours, St. Catherines and Kitchener, though London's tallest building is the tallest in the southwest. This may partly be explained by the fact that Windsor is directly across the border from Detroit, Michigan, a metropolitan area of over 4 million people. The gambling and drinking laws in Canada are more lax than in the USA so many young Americans cross over the Ambassador bridge for some fun.

Nanjing dialect

Nanjing dialect or Nanjing Mandarin is a dialect of Jianghuai Mandarin which is spoken in the city of Nanjing in China.
Family.
Nanjing dialect is a dialect of Jianghuai Mandarin, which belongs to the broader Mandarin Chinese family, which is a Sinitic language like all other Chinese languages.
Phonology.
Nanjing Jianghuai Mandarin maintains the glottal stop final and the entering tone which Northern Mandarin or Southwestern Mandarin likely had until recently as well. Like Northern Mandarin, it has preserved the retroflex initials of Middle Chinese.
In Jianghuai Mandarin, the initial does not exist. Ancestral initials are pronounced . The opposite has occurred in Southwestern Mandarin. Northern Mandarin on the other hand, retains distinct and initials. Jianghuai, like Northern Mandarin, also distinguishes between and initials, while in Southwestern Mandarin, and have merged. In Jianghuai, has "merged" into , while the opposite has occurred in Southwestern Mandarin, Northern Mandarin keeps both as separate sounds.
The two finals and are the only ones that exist in typical dialects of Mandarin. The three syllable final obstruents merged into a glottal stop in Jianghuai Mandarin, while they are not present in the majority of Southwestern Mandarin. Northern and Northwest Mandarin dialects have undergone both changes. Nanjing Mandarin, along with eastern Shanxi and some southwest Mandarin dialects, is an exception to the Mandarin norm of possessing three distinct medials , , and .
Prominence.
Jianghuai Mandarin, of which Nanjing dialect is a member of, was possibly the native language of the founding Emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang and many of his military and civil officials.
The "Guanhua koine" of the early Ming era was based on Jianghuai Guanhua (Jianghuai Mandarin). Western missionaries and Korean Hangul writings of the Ming Guanhua and Nanjing dialect showed differences, which pointed to the Guanhua being a koine and mixture of various dialects strongly based on Jianghuai.
Some linguists have studied the influence which Nanjing Jianghuai Mandarin had on Ming dynasty guanhua/Mandarin. Although the early Ming dynasty Mandarin/Guanhua was a koine based on Nanjing dialect, it was not entirely identical to it, with some non Jianghuai characteristics being found in it. Francisco Varo advised that to learn Chinese one must acquire it from "Not just any Chinese, but only those who have the natural gift of speaking the Mandarin language well, such as those natives of the Province of Nan king, and of other provinces where the Mandarin tongue is spoken well.
Expansion.
The earliest dialect of Nanjing was an ancient Wu dialect during the Eastern Jin. After the Wu Hu uprising, the Jin Emperor and many northern Chinese fled south, establishing the new capital Jiankang in what is modern day Nanjing. It was during this time that the ancient Wu of Nanjing was replaced by Jianghuai Mandarin. Further events occurred, such as Hou Jing's rebellions during the Liang dynasty, the Sui dynasty invasion of the Chen dynasty which resulted in Jiankang's destruction, Ming Taizu's relocation of southerners from below Yangtze to his newly established capital Nanjing, and the establishment of Nanjing as the capital of the Taiping Kingdom during the Taiping rebellion which resulted in a significant decrease in the city's population. These events all played in role in forming the Nanjing dialect of today.
Debate over position of Nanjing dialect vs Beijing dialect.
A debate by western sinologists over whether they should study Beijing or Nanjing Mandarin pointed out deficiencies in the opposing dialects they were advocating against.
Leipzig based Professor Gabelentz criticized the Beijing dialect. A more suitable Chinese dialect in Gabelentz's view for science was the Nanjing dialect rather than Beijing.
Only in recent times has the northern dialect, pek-kuān-hoá, in the form in the capital, kīng-hoá, begun to strive for general acceptance, and the struggle seems to be decided in its favor. It is preferred by the officials and studied by the European diplomats. Scholarship must not follow this practise. The Peking dialect is phonetically the poorest of all dialects and therefore has the most homophones. This is why it is most unsuitable for scientific purposes.
"Chinesische Grammatik", Professor Georg von Der Gabelentz (1881)
The originally Japanese book "Mandarin Compass" (官话指南) was modified with Nanjing dialect's tones and published with French commentary by Jiangnan based French missionary Henri Boucher.
Calvin W. Mateer attempted to compromise between Northern and Southern Mandarin in his book "A Course of Mandarin Lessons", published in 1892
Study of the Nanjing dialect.
Important works written on the Nanjing dialect include "Syllabar des Nankingdialektes oder der correkten Aussprache sammt Vocabular" by Franz Kühnert, and "Die Nanking Kuanhua" by K. Hemeling. The "English & Chinese vocabulary in the court dialect" by Samuel Wells Williams was based on the Nanjing dialect, rather than the Beijing dialect.
Williams also described the differences between Nanjing and Beijing Mandarin in the same book, and noted the ways in which the Peking dialect differs from the Nanjing dialect, such as "changing k before e and i, into ch, and sometimes into ts...etc." Williams also stated "These changes are tolerably regular and uniform, so that it is not difficult in speaking to adopt either the one pronunciation or the other. The soft and lengthened sounds are more pleasing to the ear; and to a person accustomed to speak English, require less effort than the short tones. F and p, nw and lw, sh and ch, ts and ch, are occasionally used for each other. The varieties now spoken of, are varieties of what in Europe is called the mandarin tongue.”
Romanization.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, romanization of Mandarin consisted of both Beijing and Nanjing pronunciations. "The Chinese recorder and missionary journal, Volume 36" explained how using both Nanjing and Beijing dialect in the Standard System of romanization was beneficial, and gave the following instructions: "Sometimes two words having the same sound in your locality will have two spellings. This is because those words are pronounced differently elsewhere. For example, 希 and 西 are both xī in Beijing, but in Nanjing the latter is si. The Standard System retains the two spellings, thus providing a spelling for the two distinct sounds as heard in Nanking. This is not only no hindrance to the use of the system in Beijing, but, on the contrary, is a decided gain. The teacher can explain that the two syllables si and Asi, which are pronounced alike in this locality, have different meanings. And that the possibility of confusing those homophonous Asi^s is thus reduced by one-half. Another example: 官 and 光 are both pronounced gwan in Nanjing, but in Beijing the latter is guāng. Here again the Standard System retains both spellings as not only spelling the Nanjing sounds more accurately, but also enriching the Nanjing dialect by distinguishing between two words having the same sounds and different meanings."
History.
"The only old sound tables, I know of, assumed to give the pronunciation of Nanking are the "Hungwu cheng yun" published by order of the Emperor Hungwu (1368—1398), the founder of the Ming-dynasty, the ruins of whose tomb lie a mile outside the east gate of Nanking. But these tables themselves do not give any information as to the dialect rendered, and as, Nanking not having been Hungwu's sole residence *— he also resided sometimes at K'aifengfu, styled by him "northern capital" —, the only valid argument which can by adduced in favour of this supposition, is the fact that Hungwu was a native of Nanking, albeit of low extraction, they cannot be considered as a basis of scientific researches. As, again, the numerous tonic dictionaries of the Chinese language covering the time since about 500 A. D. are of no help in laying down the historic lines of change of this dialect, we are unable to draw a connected picture of its historic development and must restrict ourselves to comparing some details of modern Nankingese pronunciation with that of the old Chinese language generally."
The ascendancy doubtless gained by the Nanking Kuanhua over other "Mandarin" dialects during the epochs when Nanking was the Capital of the Chinese Empire * and probably retained for some time after the removal of the central government to Peking in 1421 A. D. by Emperor Yunglo, had in the course of centuries, since gone by, gradually lost ground. It received its death-blow through the massacres, nearly extirpating the inhabitants of the unfortunate Nanking, perpetrated after its capture by the T'aip'ing rebels whose Capital it subsequently was from 1853—1864, and again in a worse degree by the Imperial forces when recapturing it. The few handfuls of old resident families that escaped destruction being insufficient to absorb the rush of immigrants from other parts of China after the suppression of the rebellion, the standard pronunciation cultivated by them could not penetrate throughout this city, and even to this day the number of its inhabitants speaking a pure and unadulterated Nanking Kuanhua is comparatively small. The days of splendour are gone never to return. The Kuanhua of Nanking is no longer a serious rival for supremacy of that of Peking: the latter, purified of its localisms, is at present the only standard spoken language recognised throughout the whole Empire, a fact not to be wondered at, if one takes into consideration that Peking has been uninterruptedly the Capital of the Chinese Empire since 1421 A. D.
Sinologes in Germany have been slow to reconcile themselves to this fact. As late as 1881 VON DER GABELENTZ in his large Chinese grammar (§ 37), while reluctantly admitting the victory of the Peking dialect in practice, calls it a fashion which science must not follow. He recommends the adoption for scientific purposes of the "Mandarin" dialect reproduced in the writings of the Jesuits of the 17th and 18th centuries which he considers to have been that of Nanking but which Arendt (Handbuch der Nordchinesischen Umgangssprache, Stuttgart und Berlin 1891; § 208—212) believes to be rather an old form of "Mandarin" dialect in general. As far as I know, Arendt (1. 1.) is the first German champion of the absolute supremacy of the Peking dialect. I cannot but agree with his remark (1. 1. § 203) that the real Nanking dialect of today is more exposed to justified objections than that of Peking.
But, even so, the Kuanhua of Nanking retains a certain superiority over its sister "Mandarin" dialects on account of, in some respects, purer and more consistent preservation of the old Chinese pronunciation. Bearing, for the same reason, a closer relationship than these to the dialects spoken on the coast of MiddleChina and in the south of China which have retained the old sounds much more faithfully than the "Mandarin" dialects, it forms in a way the connecting link between the Chinese dialects of the South and those of the North and West, and thus possesses the elements necessary for rendering it intelligible over a wider area than any other Chinese dialect.
The range of the spoken Nanking Kuanhua is not extensive. As is the case with all other Chinese dialects, the pure form of it is restricted to the intellectual centre of its sphere of domination, i. e. the city of Nanking, and does not even there prevail throughout as has been seen above. It extends with often large deviations over the greater part of northern Kiangsu and over the province of Anhui the dialects of which regions may be classed as varieties of it.
Grammar.
Tones.
The old Chinese language which distinguished four classes of tones (shēng): píng (平 - even), shàng (上 - rising), qù (去 - departing) and rù (入 - entering), each subdivided into an upper (shang) and a lower (hsia) series, i. e. eight tones in all (Dr. A. CONRADY, Eine Indochinesische CausativDenominativbildung und ihr Zusammenhang mit den Tonaccenten, Leipzig, 1896), has also at Nanking exhibited its peculiar tendency towards simplification. In the course of centuries three tones have gradually disappeared. The first was lost by the coalescence of the upper and lower "rising" tones which took place before the 13th or 14th centuries of our era (CoNRADY, 1.1. p. 182). Two more tones vanished later, probably by the fusion of the upper and lower series of the "departing" and "entering" tones, so that modern Nankingese distinguishes only the following five tones: upper-even (shang-p'ing), lower-even (hsia-p'ing), rising (shang), departing (ch'ü) and entering (ju). While the characters have at Nanking substantially retained the theoretical tones given in the old native tonic dictionaries, the nature of the tones themselves has undergone change.
The Nanking shang-p'ing (upper - even) is a low, falling tone, drawling and slowly evanescent, pronounced with a dull voice. The hsia-p'ing (lower-even) commences at a high pitch, falls suddenly and rises again, and is pronounced with a clear voice. The rising shêng is a soft, drawling, higher tone, rising smoothly with a small interval. The departing tone is high, rapidly falling, and is enunciated with a clear voice.
The entering shêng is extremely high and short, and ends abruptly with a sudden closure of the glottis (without a following explosion). The sound remaining when leaving off the final t in pronouncing words like cut, lit, etc., is the nearest approach to this tone I could find, an example, however, which is deficient in as much as it wants the jerked quickness of enunciation characteristic of this Nanking tone. Whereas the final oral stop of the old Chinese ju shêng is completely preserved in the dialect of Canton in which all ju shêng syllables still maintain the old explosive finals k, p, t, and whereas it prevails in the Swatow, Amoy and Foochow dialects, but is in the Shanghai dialect only retained in the final к, it has been entirely replaced by a glottal stop in the dialect of Nanking as also in that of Ningpo. The Nanking entering tone words thus never end in a consonant (the h in the finals eh, ieh, üeh and ih which I have taken over with Wade's romanisation and which might as well be omitted, merely serves as a mark of shortness for the vowel sounds immediately preceding it, these, therefore, being the real finals) nor in the vowel sounds ao, iao, ou, iai, iu, ui, ei and й; they terminate in the vowels a, i, о, u, ü, ê, ih, eh, the diphthongs ai, iu, uo, io, üeh, ieh (h as above) and the triphthong uai. In Western and Northern "Mandarin" dialects which have not preserved this tone, entering tone words are distributed over the four tone classes recognised there (shang-p'ing, hsia-p'ing, shang, and civil). In Pekingese they appear chiefly in the hsia-p'ing *.
The romanisation chosen by me being based on the pronunciation in the upper - even tone as the most natural one, does of course not apply equally well to that of the same syllable in the other tones, above all not to that in the entering tone, in the short and abrupt ejaculation of which the fundamental sound is often even unrecognisable. The most striking illustration of this observation is the diphthong ai, as in ai, lai, kuai, etc., which sounds in the ju sheng like the English u of but (mid-back-narrow of the English phoneticians). I have abstained from a special transcription of such entering tone sounds and have not counted them as separate syllables as doing so in a "Sound and Tone Table" like mine would be incompatible with the inherent inseparability of the enunciations of the same sound the five tones (cf. preface p. VI).
Initials.
The most characteristic feature of the Nanking dialect to be drawn attention to under this heading is, that the distinction between k, ¥ and ts, ts' on the one hand, and h and s on the other, is, as in the old language, carried consistently through also before the
Ealatal vowels i and u (likewise when in combinations ke ia, iung, iieh, etc., but not when in the guttural ih) and that the distribution of the words over these initials agrees substantially with that of the old dictionaries. But while the ts and ts' have preserved their old pronunciation, the guttural k and ¥ (before i and ii) have retained their old sound only in the vulgar tongue and not even there throughout. In the language of the educated classes of Nanking, the following palatal vowels have influenced them so as to make them turn into the mixed sound described below on p. 24, 25, the only exception being the word "to give" (Nr. 125 of the Sound Table) which is colloquially always pronounced kis (in reading chib). I have retained the ch of Wade's transcription for this more modern initial, though well aware that it is quite different from the historic original ch preceding a, e, o, ou, u and ih which contains a distinct sh. The Nanking k before t and ii for the romanisation of which I have taken over Wade's hs, likewise seems to have lost its old pronunciation under the influence of the following palatal vowels: it is, at the present time, the palatal spirant corresponding to the guttural spirant before a, e, o and w. In Western and Northern "Mandarin" dialects the initial k, ft' and ts, ts' have fused into ch, ch', and the initial h and s into hs before the palatal vowels i and ii, the pronunciation of the sounds thus formed approaching very nearly, or agreeing with, that of the Nanking Kuanhua.
The advantages as regards lessening of homophones and augmentation of different sounds gained in the Nanking dialect by the retention of the entering tone and of the distinction between the old initials before the palatal vowels are to a large extent counterbalanced by two glaring defects not recognised by any native dictionary — confusion of initial w and I, and of final dental and guttural nasals — in which this dialect exhibits the peculiar tendency to homophony characteristic of all "Mandarin" dialects, defects, however, which to the Chinese ear, untrained as it is in phonology, appear much less important than they do to the foreigner. Only the former of these faults is properly discussed in this place, the latter appertaining to the next paragraph. The confusion of initial « and I into a nasalised alveolar I takes place before all vowels: all groups beginning with w in the native standard dictionaries form at Nanking one with the corresponding I groups. While this coalescence is met with in Northern "Mandarin" only in rare exceptions e.g. in Pekingese, where lung "to make" is often pronounced nung, and chi-liang "spine" chi-niang, it takes place regularly in Western "Mandarin" before all vowels except i and ii.
The changing pronunciation of initial j at Nanking swill be described in the "diacritic marks" in Part II.
The old Chinese initial guttural ng which is still heard at Peking has been lost in Nankingese: the old wan, wfa, "'on are pronounced an, en, ou. Similarly has the initial w disappeared in Nanking: the syllables wo and wu have become o and u.
Finals.
The vowel parts of the finals have undergone so many and such complete changes since the olden times that it would carry too far to enter into their details here. Four vowel compounds occurring in the Nanking finals might, however, be drawn attention to because they are not found in Pekingese and because distinctly savouring of the old Chinese language viz.: ui after n, I and ts (in Peking passed into ei), iai after ch (turned into ieh in Peking), Hen (changed into Han in Peking) and ah, an (English a of sane; cf. diacritic marks) after I, ni, n, p, s, t and ts (also when aspirated), for which Wade's Transcriptions ien, ieh have been retained, as the corresponding sounds after ch and hs are distinctly enunciated ieh, ien in Nankingese.
Peculiarities of vowel pronunciations which apparently are neither standard nor general as, for instance, pronouncing mou as mei, che as chai, chle as chlai, she as shai, practised especially in the northern part of Nanking city — need not he commented on here since they are beyond the scope of this dissertation.
As regards the consonantal discrepancies between the modern Nanking finals and those of the old language, I have already referred to the loss of the explosive entering tone final tenues k, t, p (p. 4), and there thus remain only the final nasals to be treated of. While one of the three final nasals — dental, guttural and labial, i.e. n, ng and m — distinguished by the old Chinese language and still preserved in the Canton and Foochow dialects, was lost in the "Mandarin" dialects according to Edkins (1. 1. p. 90.) in the 14th century by the passing of the labial (m) into the dental (n) nasal, the Nanking Kuanhua — as also that of Western China — shows distinct inclination to losing another final nasal, in as much as its final dental (front) and guttural (back) nasals are confused after the vowels a, e, i. With inexplicable inconsistency they are distinguished throughout after u (as in un, ung). The numerous groups of sounds ending in ang, eng, ing thus coalesce with the corresponding groups terminating in an, en, in. While as a matter of fact in the pronunciation of these finals the dental nasal appears to be heard oftener than the guttural nasal, euphony seems the only law regulating their interchange, the same person unconscious of it himself and unable to detect the difference, sometimes pronouncing the same word with a dental nasal when uttering it by itself and with a guttural nasal when enunciating it in combination with other words. In the present transient stage of the dialect it would of course be idle speculation to predict the ultimate fate of the two nasals.

2010 Oklahoma state budget

The Oklahoma State Budget for Fiscal Year 2010, is a spending request by Governor Brad Henry to fund government operations for July 1, 2009–June 30, 2010. Governor Henry and legislative leader approved the budget in May 2009. 
Figures shown in the spending request do not reflect the actual appropriations for Fiscal Year 2011, which must be authorized by the Legislature.
Overview.
The state budget for fiscal year 2010 began with a decrease in tax revenues of almost $310 million, or 4.4%, from the previous fiscal year. A primary reason for this decrease was enactment of House Bill 1172 in 2006. HB1172 enacted the largest tax cut in state history by lowering the state income tax rate from 6.25% in 2006 to 5.25% in 2011. HB1172 also increased the standard deduction to match the federal standard deduction in 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was passed February 2009 and the State applied for money available under the act. This included $404 million for the state Medicaid program and $236 million for education, among others. These funds allowed the Oklahoma Legislature to balance the state budget. 
Early on in the fiscal year, the effects of the late-2000s recession reached Oklahoma and caused tax revenues to decrease significantly. The Governor's Office reported that tax revenues decreased $1.2 billion between July 2009 and September 2009. This decrease caused Governor Brad Henry to order all state agencies to decrease their budgets by 5%. By November 2009, Governor Henry ordered the cuts increased to 7% and then to 7.5% by January 2010. By the end of the fiscal year, tax revenues had decreased from an estimated $6.8 billion in 2009 to $5.3 billion in 2010, a net decrease of 22%.
Total Revenue.
Estimated tax revenue for fiscal year 2011 is $6.8 billion, an estimated decrease of 4.4% from FY2009 amounts of $7 billion:
All revenue of the $7.1 billion budget revenue breaks down as follows:

2011 Hong Kong Sevens

The 2011 Hong Kong Sevens was a seven-a-side rugby union tournament, part of the 2010–11 IRB Sevens World Series. The competition was being held from 25–27 March in at Hong Kong Stadium in Hong Kong and featured 24 teams.
Security.
Following an incident in 2010 when one spectator invaded the pitch, climbed onto the crossbars at the south end of the stadium before dodging back into the stands and disappearing, organisers stepped up security and announced a zero-tolerance policy of invaders in 2011. Out of concerns for safety, the local Rugby Union sent out notification that anyone entering the playing area who should not enter would be arrested by the police, instead of just being ejected from the arena.
Hong Kong Police said they received 28 reports of fans who had been victims of ticket fraud. The fans had bought the tickets from websites based in Australia, Dubai and England. The Wan Chai criminal investigation team is looking into the cases, which have been classified as "crimes outside Hong Kong." The Hong Kong Rugby Football Union confirmed that easily distinguishable bogus tickets, differing in both colour and font types, were found at the entrance to the venue. Their holders were refused entry.
Knockout stage.
Cup.
New Zealand, Fiji, England and Samoa reached the semi-finals round. Fiji facing the New Zealand All Blacks, the World Series leaders and favourites 19–14 while England faced Samoa. After Fiji and Samoa were knocked out, both by 19–14, New Zealand faced England in the final.
New Zealand triumphed 29–17 over England: Frank Halai put the All Blacks ahead with a try, and Mat Turner equalised for England. By half time, New Zealand nudged 12–5 ahead after Halai scored a second try.
At the end of the tournament, New Zealand lead England by five points in the World Championship. With 105 points, England remain well clear of Fiji and Samoa, who rank third-equal on 84 points.

Achaemenid Empire

The Achaemenid Empire (; Old Persian: "Pārsa"; New Persian: شاهنشاهی هخامنشی c. 550–330 BC), or , was an empire based in Western Asia, founded in the 6th century BC by Cyrus the Great. The dynasty draws its name from king Achaemenes, who ruled Persis between 705 BC and 675 BC. The empire expanded to eventually rule over significant portions of the ancient world, which at around 500 BC stretched from parts of the Balkans (Bulgaria-Pannonia) and Thrace-Macedonia in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. The Achaemenid Empire would eventually control Egypt as well. It was ruled by a series of monarchs who unified its disparate tribes and nationalities by constructing a complex network of roads.
By the 600s BC, the Persians ("Parsa") had settled in the region in the southwestern portion of the Iranian plateau, in what came to be known as Persis ("city of Persians") bounded on the west by the Tigris River and on the south by the Persian Gulf; this region came to be their heartland. It was from this region that Cyrus the Great would advance to defeat the Kingdom of Media, the Kingdom of Lydia, and the Babylonian Empire, to form the Achaemenid Empire.
At the height of its power after the conquest of Egypt, the empire encompassed approximately 8 million square kilometers spanning three continents: Asia, Europe and Africa. At its greatest extent, the empire included the modern territories of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya, Turkey, Thrace and Macedonia, much of the Black Sea coastal regions, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, much of Central Asia, Afghanistan, northern Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and parts of Oman and the UAE. According to Guinness World Records, the empire at its peak ruled over 44% of the world's population, the highest such figure for any empire in history. It is noted in Western history as the antagonist foe of the Greek city states during the Greco-Persian Wars, for emancipation of slaves including the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity, and for instituting infrastructures such as a postal system, road systems, and the usage of an official language, Aramaic, throughout its territories. The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the King and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires. The delegation of power to local governments eventually weakened the king's central authority, causing resources to be expended in attempts to subdue local rebellions. This accounts for the dis-unification of the region by the time Alexander the Great invaded Persia in 334 BC.
This viewpoint however is challenged by some modern scholars who argue that the Achaemenid Empire was not facing any such crisis around the time of Alexander, and that only internal succession struggles within the Achaemenid family ever came close to weakening the empire. Alexander, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great, would eventually cause the collapse of the empire and its disintegration around 330 BC into what later became the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time. The Persian culture of the central plateau, however, continued to thrive and eventually reclaimed power by the 2nd century BC.
The historical mark of the Achaemenid Empire went far beyond its territorial and military influences and included cultural, social, technological and religious influences as well. Many Athenians adopted Achaemenid customs in their daily lives in a reciprocal cultural exchange, some being employed by, or allied to the Persian kings. The impact of Cyrus the Great's Edict of Restoration is mentioned in Judeo-Christian texts and the empire was instrumental in the spread of Zoroastrianism as far east as China. Even Alexander the Great, the man who would set out to conquer this vast empire, would respect its customs, by enforcing respect for the royal Persian kings including Cyrus the Great, and even by appearing in proskynesis, a Persian royal custom, despite stern Macedonian disapproval. The Persian Empire would also set the tone for the politics, heritage and history of modern Persia (now called Iran).
In 480 BC, it is estimated that 50 million people lived in the Achaemenid Empire.
History.
Achaemenid Timeline.
"Astronomical year numbering"
Origin.
The Persian Empire was created by nomadic Persians who originally referred to themselves as "parsua". The name Persia is a Greek and Latin pronunciation of the name Parsua, referring to people originating from Persis (or in Persian, Pars), their home territory located north of the Persian Gulf in south western Iran.
Despite its success and rapid expansion, the Achaemenid Empire was not the first Iranian empire, as by 6th century BC another group of ancient Iranian people had already established the Median Empire. The Medes had originally been the dominant Iranian group in the region, rising to power at the end of the 7th century BC and incorporating the Persians into their empire. The Iranian people had arrived in the region circa 1000 BC and had initially fallen under the domination of the Assyrian Empire (911-609 BC). However, the Medes and Persians (together with the Scythians and Babylonians) played a major role in the defeat of Assyrians and establishment of the first Persian empire.
The term Achaemenid is in fact the Latinized version of the Old Persian name "Haxāmaniš" (a bahuvrihi compound translating to "having a friend's mind"), meaning in Greek "of the family of the Achaemenis." Despite the derivation of the name, Achaemenes was himself a minor 7th-century ruler of the Anshan (Ansham or Anšān) located in southwestern Iran. It was not until the time of Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia), a descendant of Achaemenes, that the Achaemenid Empire developed the prestige of an empire and set out to incorporate the existing empires of the ancient east, becoming the vast Persian Empire of ancient legend.
At some point in 550 BC, Cyrus the Great rose in rebellion against the Median Empire (most likely due to the Medes' mismanagement of Persis), eventually conquering the Medes and creating the first Persian empire. Cyrus the Great utilized his tactical genius, as well as his understanding of the socio-political conditions governing his territories, to eventually incorporate into the Persian Empire the neighbouring Lydian and Neo-Babylonian empires, also leading the way for his successor, Cambyses II, to venture into Egypt and defeat the Egyptian Kingdom.
Cyrus the Great's political acumen was reflected in his management of his newly formed empire, as the Persian Empire became the first to attempt to govern many different ethnic groups on the principle of equal responsibilities and rights for all people, so long as subjects paid their taxes and kept the peace. Additionally, the king agreed not to interfere with the local customs, religions, and trades of its subject states, a unique quality that eventually won Cyrus the support of the Babylonians. This system of management ultimately became an issue for the Persians, as with a larger empire came the need for order and control, leading to expenditure of resources and mobilization of troops to quell local rebellions, and weakening the central power of the king. By the time of Darius III, this disorganization had almost led to a disunited realm.
The Persians from whom Cyrus hailed were originally nomadic pastoral people in the western Iranian plateau and by 850 BC were calling themselves the "Parsa" and their constantly shifting territory "Parsua", for the most part localized around Persis (Pars). As Persians gained power, they developed the infrastructure to support their growing influence, including creation of a capital named Pasargadae and an opulent city named Persepolis.
Begun during the rule of Darius the Great (Darius I) and completed some 100 years later, Persepolis was a symbol of the empire serving both as a ceremonial centre and a center of government. It had a special set of gradually progressive stairways named "All Countries" around which carved relief decoration depicted scenes of heroism, hunting, natural themes, and presentation of the gifts to the Achaemenid kings by their subjects during the spring festival, Nowruz. The core structure was composed of a multitude of square rooms or halls, the biggest of which was called "Apadana". Tall, decorated columns welcomed visitors and emphasized the height of the structure. Later on, Darius the Great (Darius I) also utilized Susa and Ecbatana as his governmental centres, developing them to a similar metropolitan status.
Account of the ancestral lineage of the Persian kings of the Achaemenid dynasty can be derived from either documented Greek or Roman accounts, or from existing documented Persian accounts such as those found in the Behistun Inscription. However, since most existing accounts of this vast empire are in works of Greek philosophers and historians, and since many of the original Persian documents are lost, not to mention varying scholarly views on their origin and possible motivations behind them, it is difficult to create a definitive and completely objective list. Nonetheless, it is clear that Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia) and Darius the Great (Darius I of Persia) were critical in the expansion of the empire. Cyrus the Great is often believed to be the son of Cambyses I, grandson of Cyrus I, the father of Cambyses II, and a relative of Darius the Great, through a shared ancestor, Teispes. Cyrus the Great is also believed to have been a family member (possibly grandson) of the Median king Astyages through his mother, Mandana of Media. A minority of scholars argue that perhaps Achaemenes was a retrograde creation of Darius the Great, in order to reconcile his connection with Cyrus the Great after gaining power.
Ancient Greek writers provide some legendary information about Achaemenes by calling his tribe the "Pasargadae" and stating that he was "raised by an eagle". Plato, when writing about the Persians, identified Achaemenes with Perses, ancestor of the Persians in Greek mythology. According to Plato, Achaemenes was the same person as Perses, a son of the Ethiopian queen Andromeda and the Greek hero Perseus, and a grandson of Zeus. Later writers believed that Achaemenes and Perses were different people, and that Perses was an ancestor of the king. This account further confirms that Achaemenes could well have been a significiant Anshan leader and an ancestor of Cyrus the Great. Regardless, both Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great were related, prominent kings of Persia, under whose rule the empire expanded to include much of the ancient world.
Formation and expansion.
The empire took its unified form with a central administration around Pasargadae erected by Cyrus the Great. The empire ended up conquering and enlarging the Median Empire to include in addition Egypt and Asia Minor. During the reigns of Darius I and his son Xerxes I it engaged in military conflict with some of the major city-states of Ancient Greece, and although it came close to defeating the Greek army this war ultimately led to the empire's overthrow.
In 559 BC, Cambyses I the Elder was succeeded as the king of Anšān by his son Cyrus II the Great, who also succeeded the still-living Arsames as the King of Persia, thus reuniting the two realms. Cyrus is considered to be the first true king of the Persian Empire, as his predecessors were subservient to the Medes. Cyrus the Great conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylon. Cyrus was politically shrewd, modeling himself as the "savior" of conquered nations, often allowing displaced people to return, and giving his subjects freedom to practice local customs. To reinforce this image, he instituted policies of religious freedom, and restored temples and other infrastructure in the newly acquired cities (Most notably the Jewish inhabitants of Babylon, as recorded in the Cyrus Cylinder and the Tanakh). As a result of his tolerant policies he came to be known by those of the Jewish faith, as "the anointed of the Lord."
His immediate successors were less successful. Cyrus' son Cambyses II conquered Egypt in 525 BC, but died in July 522 BC during a revolt led by a sacerdotal clan that had lost its power following Cyrus' conquest of Media. The cause of his death remains uncertain, although it may have been the result of an accident.
According to Herodotus, Cambyses II had originally ventured into Egypt to take revenge for the pharaoh Amasis's trickery when he sent a fake Egyptian bride whose family Amasis had murdered, instead of his own daughter, to wed Cambyses II. Additionally negative reports of mistreatment caused by Amasis, given by Phanes of Halicarnassus, a wise council man serving Amasis, further enforced Cambyses's resolve to venture into Egypt. Amasis died before Cambyses II could face him, but his successor Psamtik III was defeated by Cambyses II in the Battle of Pelusium.
While Cambyses II was in Egypt, the Zoroastrian priests, whom Herodotus called Magi, usurped the throne for one of their own, Gaumata, who then pretended to be Cambyses II's younger brother Bardiya (Greek: "Smerdis" or "Tanaoxares/Tanyoxarkes"), who had been assassinated some three years earlier. Owing to the strict rule of Cambyses II, especially his stance on taxation, and his long absence in Egypt, "the whole people, Perses, Medes and all the other nations," acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years (Herodotus iii. 68). Cambyses II himself would not be able to quell the imposters, as he died on the way back from Egypt.
The claim that Gaumata had impersonated Bardiya (Smerdis), is derived from Darius the Great and the records at the Behistun Inscription. Historians are divided over the possibility that the story of the impostor was invented by Darius as justification for his coup. Darius made a similar claim when he later captured Babylon, announcing that the Babylonian king was not, in fact, Nebuchadnezzar III, but an impostor named Nidintu-bel.
According to the Behistun Inscription, Gaumata ruled for seven months before being overthrown in 522 BC by Darius the Great (Darius I) (Old Persian "Dāryavuš" "Who Holds Firm the Good", also known as "Darayarahush" or Darius the Great). The Magi, though persecuted, continued to exist, and a year following the death of the first pseudo-Smerdis (Gaumata), saw a second pseudo-Smerdis (named Vahyazdāta) attempt a coup. The coup, though initially successful, failed.
Herodotus writes that the native leadership debated the best form of government for the empire. It was agreed that an oligarchy would divide them against one another, and democracy would bring about mob rule resulting in a charismatic leader resuming the monarchy. Therefore, they decided a new monarch was in order, particularly since "they" were in a position to choose him. Darius I was chosen monarch from among the leaders. He was cousin to Cambyses II and Bardiya (Smerdis), claiming Ariaramnes as his ancestor.
The Achaemenids thereafter consolidated areas firmly under their control. It was Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great who, by sound and farsighted administrative planning, brilliant military maneuvering, and a humanistic world view, established the greatness of the Achaemenids and, in less than thirty years, raised them from an obscure tribe to a world power. It was during the reign of Darius the Great (Darius I) that Persepolis was built (518–516 BC) and which would serve as capital for several generations of Achaemenid kings. Ecbatana ("Hagmatāna" "City of Gatherings", modern: Hamadan) in Media was greatly expanded during this period and served as the summer capital.
Darius the Great (Darius I) eventually attacked the Greek mainland, which had supported rebellious Greek colonies under his aegis; but as a result of his defeat at the Battle of Marathon, he was forced to pull the limits of his empire back to Asia Minor. Some scholars argue that in the context of history of the Near and Middle east in the first millennium, Alexander can be considered as the "last of the Achaemenids." This is partly because Alexander maintained more or less the same political structure, and borders as the previous Achaemenid kings.
By the 5th century BC the Kings of Persia were either ruling over or had subordinated territories encompassing not just all of the Persian Plateau and all of the territories formerly held by the Assyrian Empire (Mesopotamia, the Levant, Cyprus and Egypt), but beyond this all of Anatolia and the Armenian Plateau as well as much of the Southern Caucasus, Macedonia and parts of Greece and Thrace to the north and west, parts of Central Asia as far as the Aral Sea, the Oxus and Jaxartes to the north and north-east, the Hindu Kush and the western Indus basin (corresponding to modern Afghanistan and Pakistan) to the east, parts of northern Arabia to the south and parts of northern Libya to the south-west.
Greco-Persian Wars.
The Ionian Revolt in 499 BC, and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. In 499 BC, the then tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus (both financially and in terms of prestige). The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.
The Persians continued to reduce the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement in 493 BC on Ionia that was generally considered to be both just and fair. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all of Greece. However, the Persian forces were defeated at the Battle of Marathon and Darius would die before having the chance to launch an invasion of Greece.
Xerxes I (485–465 BC, Old Persian "Xšayārša" "Hero Among Kings"), son of Darius I, vowed to complete the job. He organized a massive invasion aiming to conquer Greece. His army entered Greece from the north, meeting little or no resistance through Macedonia and Thessaly, but was delayed by a small Greek force for three days at Thermopylae. A simultaneous naval battle at Artemisium was tactically indecisive as large storms destroyed ships from both sides. The battle was stopped prematurely when the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. The battle was a strategic victory for the Persians, giving them uncontested control of Artemisium and the Aegean Sea.
Following his victory at the Battle of Thermopylae, Xerxes sacked the evacuated city of Athens and prepared to meet the Greeks at the strategic Isthmus of Corinth and the Saronic Gulf. In 480 BC the Greeks won a decisive victory over the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis and forced Xerxes to retire to Sardis. The land army which he left in Greece under Mardonius retook Athens but was eventually destroyed in 479 BC at the Battle of Plataea. The final defeat of the Persians at Mycale encouraged the Greek cities of Asia to revolt, and marked the end of Persian expansion into Europe.
The cultural phase.
Xerxes I was followed by Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC), who moved the capital from Persepolis to Babylon. It was during this reign that Elamite ceased to be the language of government, and Aramaic gained in importance. It was probably during this reign that the solar calendar was introduced as the national calendar. Under Artaxerxes I, Zoroastrianism became the "de facto" religion of state, and for this Artaxerxes I is today also known as the Constantine of that faith.
Artaxerxes I died in Susa, and his body was brought to Persepolis for interment in the tomb of his forebears. Artaxerxes I was immediately succeeded by his eldest son Xerxes II, who was however assassinated by one of his half-brothers a few weeks later. Darius II rallied support for himself and marched eastwards, executing the assassin and was crowned in his stead.
From 412 Darius II (423–404 BC), at the insistence of the able Tissaphernes, gave support first to Athens, then to Sparta, but in 407 BC, Darius' son Cyrus the Younger was appointed to replace Tissaphernes and aid was given entirely to Sparta which finally defeated Athens in 404 BC. In the same year, Darius fell ill and died in Babylon. At his deathbed, his Babylonian wife Parysatis pleaded with Darius to have her second eldest son Cyrus (the Younger) crowned, but Darius refused.
Darius was then succeeded by his eldest son Artaxerxes II Memnon. Plutarch relates (probably on the authority of Ctesias) that the displaced Tissaphernes came to the new king on his coronation day to warn him that his younger brother Cyrus (the Younger) was preparing to assassinate him during the ceremony. Artaxerxes had Cyrus arrested and would have had him executed if their mother Parysatis had not intervened. Cyrus was then sent back as Satrap of Lydia, where he prepared an armed rebellion. Cyrus and Artaxerxes met in the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC, where Cyrus was killed.
Artaxerxes II (404–358 BC), was the longest reigning of the Achaemenid kings and it was during this 45-year period of relative peace and stability that many of the monuments of the era were constructed. Artaxerxes moved the capital back to Persepolis, which he greatly extended. Also the summer capital at Ecbatana was lavishly extended with gilded columns and roof tiles of silver and copper (Polybius, 27 October 2012). The extraordinary innovation of the Zoroastrian shrine cults can also be dated to his reign, and it was probably during this period that Zoroastrianism was disseminated throughout Asia Minor and the Levant, from Armenia. The temples, though serving a religious purpose, were however not a purely selfless act: they also served as an important source of income. From the Babylonian kings, the Achaemenids had taken over the concept of a mandatory temple tax, a one-tenth tithe which all inhabitants paid to the temple nearest to their land or other source of income (Dandamaev & Lukonin, 1989:361–362). A share of this income called the "quppu ša šarri", "kings chest"—an ingenious institution originally introduced by Nabonidus—was then turned over to the ruler. In retrospect, Artaxerxes is generally regarded as an amiable man who lacked the moral fibre to be a really successful ruler. However, six centuries later Ardeshir I, founder of the second Persian Empire, would consider himself Artaxerxes' successor, a grand testimony to the importance of Artaxerxes to the Persian psyche.
Fall of the empire.

According to Plutarch, Artaxerxes' successor Artaxerxes III (358 – 338 BC) came to the throne by bloody means, ensuring his place upon the throne by the assassination of eight of his half-brothers. In 343 BC Artaxerxes III defeated Nectanebo II, driving him from Egypt, and made Egypt once again a Persian satrapy. In 338 BC Artaxerxes III died under unclear circumstances (natural causes according to cuneiform sources but Diodorus, a Greek historian, reports that Artaxerxes was murdered by Bagoas, his minister), while Philip of Macedon united the Greek states by force and began to plan an invasion into the empire.
Artaxerxes III was succeeded by Artaxerxes IV Arses, who before he could act was also poisoned by Bagoas. Bagoas is further said to have killed not only all Arses' children, but many of the other princes of the land. Bagoas then placed Darius III (336–330 BC), a nephew of Artaxerxes IV, on the throne. Darius III, previously Satrap of Armenia, personally forced Bagoas to swallow poison. In 334 BC, when Darius was just succeeding in subduing Egypt again, Alexander and his battle-hardened troops invaded Asia Minor.
At two different times, the Achaemenids ruled Egypt although the Egyptians twice regained temporary independence from Persia. After the practice of Manetho, Egyptian historians refer to the periods in Egypt when the Achaemenid dynasty ruled as the twenty-seventh dynasty of Egypt, 525–404 BC, until the death of Darius II, and the thirty-first dynasty of Egypt, 343–332 BC, which began after Nectanebo II was defeated by the Persian king Artaxerxes III.
Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedon) defeated the Persian armies at Granicus (334 BC), followed by Issus (333 BC), and lastly at Gaugamela (331 BC). Afterwards, he marched on Susa and Persepolis which surrendered in early 330 BC. From Persepolis, Alexander headed north to Pasargadae where he visited the tomb of Cyrus, the burial of the man whom he had heard of from Cyropedia.
In the ensuing chaos created by Alexander the Great's invasion of Persia, Cyrus the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander the Great reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi, putting them to court. On some accounts, Alexander's decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus's tomb. Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered Aristobulus to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior, showing respect for Cyrus. From there he headed to Ecbatana, where Darius III had sought refuge.
Darius III was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men murder Darius III and then declared himself Darius' successor, as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia leaving Darius' body in the road to delay Alexander, who brought it to Persepolis for an honorable funeral. Bessus would then create a coalition of his forces, in order to create an army to defend against Alexander. Before Bessus could fully unite with his confederates at the eastern part of the empire, Alexander, fearing the danger of Bessus gaining control, found him, put him on trial in a Persian court under his control, and ordered his execution in a "cruel and barbarous manner".
Despite having succeeded to conquer the whole of the Persian empire, Alexander the Great, was nonetheless unable to offer a stable alternative. After his death, Alexander's once massive Hellenistic empire was broken up by his ambitious generals (the Diadochi), and succeeded by a few smaller empires, the largest of which was the Seleucid Empire, ruled by the generals of Alexander and their descendants. They in turn would be succeeded by the Parthian Empire.
Part of the cause of the Empire's decline had been the heavy tax burden put upon the state, which eventually led to economic decline. An estimate of the tribute imposed on the subject nations was up to U.S. $180M per year. This does not include the material goods and supplies that were supplied as taxes. After the high overhead of government - the military, the bureaucracy, whatever the satraps could safely dip into the coffers for themselves - this money went into the royal treasury. At Persepolis, Alexander III found some 180,000 talents, besides the additional treasure the Macedonians were carrying that already had been seized in Damascus by Parmenio. This amounted to U.S. $2.7B. On top of this, Darius III had taken 8,000 talents with him on his flight to the north. Alexander put this static hoard back into the economy, and upon his death some 130,000 talents had been spent on the building of cities, dockyards, temples, and the payment of the troops, besides the ordinary government expenses. Additionally, one of the satraps, Harpalus, had made off to Greece with some 6,000 talents, which Athens used to rebuild its economy after seizing it during the struggles with the Corinthian League. Due to the flood of money from Alexander's hoard entering Greece, however, a disruption in the economy occurred, in agriculture, banking, rents, the great increase in mercenary soldiers that cash allowed the wealthy, and an increase in piracy.
Another factor contributing to the decline of the Empire after Xerxes was its failure of ever molding the many subject nations into a whole; no national identity was ever attempted at. This looseness eventually affected the efficiency of the military.
Descendants in later Iranian dynasties.
Istakhr, one of the vassal kingdoms of the Parthian Empire, would be overthrown by Papak, a priest of the temple there. Papak's son, Ardašir I, who named himself in remembrance of Artaxerxes II, would revolt against the Parthians, eventually defeating them and establishing the Sassanid Empire or as it is known the second Persian Empire.
Both the later dynasties of the Parthians and Sasanians would on occasion claim Achaemenid descent. Recently there has been some corroboration for the Parthian claim to Achaemenid ancestry via the possibility of an inherited disease (neurofibromatosis) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.
Government.
Cyrus the Great founded the empire as a multi-state empire, governed by four capital states; Pasargadae, Babylon, Susa and Ekbatana. The Achaemenids allowed a certain amount of regional autonomy in the form of the satrapy system. A satrapy was an administrative unit, usually organized on a geographical basis. A 'satrap' (governor) was the vassal king, who administered the region, a 'general' supervised military recruitment and ensured order, and a 'state secretary' kept the official records. The general and the state secretary reported directly to the satrap as well as the central government. At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 satrapies.
Cyrus the Great created an organized army including the Immortals unit, consisting of 10,000 highly trained soldiers Cyrus also formed an innovative postal system throughout the empire, based on several relay stations called Chapar Khaneh.
Darius the Great moved the capital from Pasargadae to Persepolis; he revolutionized the economy by placing it on a silver and gold coinage and introducing a regulated and sustainable tax system that was precisely tailored to each satrapy, based on their supposed productivity and their economic potential. For instance, Babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities – 1000 silver talents, four months supply of food for the army. India was clearly already fabled for its gold; the province consisting of the sindh and western Punjab regions of ancient northwestern India traded gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4680 silver talents for various commodities. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (as later of Rome's) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This was exclusively a tax levied on subject peoples. Other accomplishments of Darius' reign included codification of the data, a universal legal system, and construction of a new capital at Persepolis.
Under the Achaemenids, the trade was extensive and there was an efficient infrastructure that facilitated the exchange of commodities in the far reaches of the empire. Tariffs on trade were one of the empire's main sources of revenue, along with agriculture and tribute.
The satrapies were linked by a 2,500-kilometer highway, the most impressive stretch being the Royal Road from Susa to Sardis, built by command of Darius I. The relays of mounted couriers could reach the remotest of areas in fifteen days. Despite the relative local independence afforded by the satrapy system, royal inspectors, the "eyes and ears of the king", toured the empire and reported on local conditions. The king also maintained a personal bodyguard of the elite 10,000 Immortals when not at war.
The practice of slavery in Achaemenid Persia was generally banned, although there is evidence that conquered and/or rebellious armies were sold into captivity. Zoroastrianism, the de facto religion of the empire, explicitly forbids slavery, and the kings of Achaemenid Persia, especially the founder Cyrus the Great, followed this ban to varying degrees, as evidenced by the freeing of the Jews at Babylon, and the construction of Persepolis by paid workers.
The vexilloid of the Achaemenid Empire was a gold falcon on a field of crimson.
Military.
Despite its humble origins in Persis, the empire reached an enormous size under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus created a multi-state empire where he allowed regional rulers, called the 'satrap' to rule as his proxy over a certain designated area of his empire called the satrapy. The basic rule of governance was based upon loyalty and obedience of each satrapy to the central power, or the king, and compliance with tax laws. Due to the ethnocultural diversity of the subject nations under the rule of Persia, its enormous geographic size, and the constant struggle for power by regional competitors, the creation of a professional army was necessary for both maintenance of the peace, and also to enforce the authority of the king in cases of rebellion and foreign threat. Cyrus managed to create a strong land army, using it to advance in his campaigns in Babylonia, Lydia, and Asia Minor, which after his death was used by his son Cambyses II, in Egypt against Psamtik III. Cyrus would die battling a local Iranian insurgency in the empire, before he could have a chance to develop a naval force. That task however would fall to Darius the Great, who would officially give Persians their own royal navy to allow them to engage their enemies on multiple seas of this vast empire, from the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea, to the Persian Gulf, Ionian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.
Navy.
Since its foundation by Cyrus, the Persian empire had been primarily a land empire with a strong army, but void of any actual naval forces. By the 5th century BC, this was to change, as the empire came across Greek, and Egyptian forces, each with their own maritime traditions and capabilities. Darius the Great (Darius I) is to be credited as the first Achaemenid king to invest in a Persian fleet. Even by then no true "imperial navy" had existed either in Greece or Egypt. Persia would become the first empire, under Darius, to inaugurate and deploy the first regular imperial navy. Despite this achievement, the personnel for the imperial navy would not come from Iran, but were often Phoenicians (mostly from Sidon), Egyptians, Cypriots, and Greeks chosen by Darius the Great to operate the empire's combat vessels.
At first the ships were built in Sidon by the Phoenicians; the first Achaemenid ships measured about 40 meters in length and 6 meters in width, able to transport up to 300 Persian troops at any one trip. Despite origin of the technique of the arsenal and ship construction in Sidon, soon other states of the empire were constructing their own ships each incorporating slight local preferences. The ships eventually found their way to the Persian Gulf. Persian naval forces laid the foundation for a strong Persian maritime presence in the Persian Gulf, that existed until the arrival of the British East India Company, and the Royal Navy in the mid-19th century AD. Persians were not only stationed on islands of the Persian Gulf, but also had ships often of 100 to 200 capacity patrolling the empire's various rivers including the Shatt-al-Arab, Tigris and Nile in the west, as well as the Indus.
The Achaemenid high naval command had established major naval bases located along the Shatt-al-Arab, Bahrain, Oman, and Yemen. The Persian fleet would soon not only be used for peace-keeping purposes along the Shatt al-Arab but would also open the door to trade with India via the Persian Gulf. Darius's navy was in many ways a world power at the time, but it would be Artaxerxes II who in the summer of 397 BC would build a formidable navy, as part of a rearmament which would lead to his decisive victory at Knidos in 394 BC, reestablishing Achaemenid power in Ionia. Artaxerxes II would also utilize his massive navy to later on quell a rebellion in Egypt.
The construction material of choice was wood, but some armored Achaemenid ships had metallic blades on the front, often meant to slice enemy ships using the ship's momentum. Naval ships were also equipped with hooks on the side to grab enemy ships, or to negotiate their position. The ships were propelled by sails or manpower. The ships the Persians created were unique. As far as maritime engagement, the ships were equipped with two mangonels that would launch projectiles such as stones, or flammable substances.
Xenophon describes his eye-witness account of a massive military bridge created by joining 37 Persian ships across the Tigris river. The Persians utilized each boat's buoyancy, in order to support a connected bridge above which supply could be transferred. Herodotus also gives many accounts of Persians utilizing ships to build bridges.
Darius the Great, in an attempt to subdue the Scythian horsemen north of the Black sea, crossed over at the Bosphorus, using an enormous bridge made by connecting Achaemenid boats, then marched up to the Danube, crossing it by means of a second boat bridge. The bridge over the Bosphorus essentially connected the nearest tip of Asia to Europe, encompasing at least some 1000 meters of open water if not more. Herodotus describes the spectacle, and calls it the "bridge of Darius":
Years later, a similar boat bridge would be constructed by Xerxes the Great (Xerxes I), in his invasion of Greece. Although the Persians failed to capture the Greek city states completely, the tradition of maritime involvement was carried down by the Persian kings, most notably Artaxerxes II. Years later, when Alexander invaded Persia and during his advancement into India, he took a page from the Persian art of war, by having Hephaestion and Perdiccas construct a similar boat-bridge at the Indus river, in India in spring of 327 BC
Culture.
Herodotus, in his mid-5th century BC account of Persian residents of the Pontus, reports that Persian youths, from their fifth year to their twentieth year, were instructed in three things – "to ride a horse, to draw a bow, and to speak the Truth".
He further notes that:
In Achaemenid Persia, the lie, "druj", is considered to be a cardinal sin, and it was punishable by death in some extreme cases. Tablets discovered by archaeologists in the 1930s at the site of Persepolis give us adequate evidence about the love and veneration for the culture of truth during the Achaemenian period. These tablets contain the names of ordinary Persians, mainly traders and warehouse-keepers. According to Professor Stanley Insler of Yale University, as many as 72 names of officials and petty clerks found on these tablets contain the word "truth". Thus, says Insler, we have "Artapana", protector of truth, "Artakama", lover of truth, "Artamanah", truth-minded, "Artafarnah", possessing splendour of truth, "Artazusta", delighting in truth, "Artastuna", pillar of truth, "Artafrida", prospering the truth and "Artahunara", having nobility of truth. It was Darius the Great who laid down the "ordinance of good regulations" during his reign. King Darius' testimony about his constant battle against the lie is found in cuneiform inscriptions. Carved high up in the Behistun mountain on the road to Kermanshah, Darius the Great (Darius I) testifies:
Darius had his hands full dealing with large-scale rebellion which broke out throughout the empire. After fighting successfully with nine traitors in a year, Darius records his battles against them for posterity and tells us how it was the "lie" that made them rebel against the empire. At Behistun, Darius says:
King Darius then tells us,
Then an advice to his son Xerxes, who is to succeed him as the great king:
Languages.
During the reign of Cyrus and Darius, and as long as the seat of government was still at Susa in Elam, the language of the chancellory was Elamite. This is primarily attested in the Persepolis fortification and treasury tablets that reveal details of the day-to-day functioning of the empire. In the grand rock-face inscriptions of the kings, the Elamite texts are always accompanied by Akkadian and Old Persian inscriptions, and it appears that in these cases, the Elamite texts are translations of the Old Persian ones. It is then likely that although Elamite was used by the capital government in Susa, it was not a standardized language of government everywhere in the empire. The use of Elamite is not attested after 458 BC.
Following the conquest of Mesopotamia, the Aramaic language (as used in that territory) was adopted as a "vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did." In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an "official language", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language. Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the ""lingua franca"" of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought. Many centuries after the fall of the empire, Aramaic script and – as ideograms – Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the Pahlavi writing system.
Although Old Persian also appears on some seals and art objects, that language is attested primarily in the Achaemenid inscriptions of Western Iran, suggesting then that Old Persian was the common language of that region. However, by the reign of Artaxerxes II, the grammar and orthography of the inscriptions was so "far from perfect" that it has been suggested that the scribes who composed those texts had already largely forgotten the language, and had to rely on older inscriptions, which they to a great extent reproduced verbatim.
Customs.
Herodotus mentions that the Persians were invited to great birthday feasts (Herodotus, "Histories" 8), which would be followed by many desserts, a treat which they reproached the Greeks for omitting from their meals. He also observed that the Persians drank wine in large quantities and used it even for counsel, deliberating on important affairs when drunk, and deciding the next day, when sober, whether to act on the decision or set it aside.
Religion.
It was during the Achaemenid period that Zoroastrianism reached South-Western Iran, where it came to be accepted by the rulers and through them became a defining element of Persian culture. The religion was not only accompanied by a formalization of the concepts and divinities of the traditional Iranian pantheon but also introduced several novel ideas, including that of free will.
Under the patronage of the Achaemenid kings, and by the 5th century BC as the "de facto" religion of the state, Zoroastrianism reached all corners of the empire. The Bible claims that Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to their homeland after decades of captivity by the Assyrian and Babylonian empires.
During the reign of Artaxerxes I and Darius II, Herodotus wrote "Perses have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and consider the use of them a sign of folly. This comes, I think, from their not believing the gods to have the same nature with men, as the Greeks imagine." He claims the Persians offer sacrifice to: "the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire, to water, and to the winds. These are the only gods whose worship has come down to them from ancient times. At a later period they began the worship of Urania, which they borrowed from the Arabians and Assyrians. Mylitta is the name by which the Assyrians know this goddess, to whom the Persians referred as Anahita." (The original name here is Mithra, which has since been explained to be a confusion of Anahita with Mithra, understandable since they were commonly worshipped together in one temple).
From the Babylonian scholar-priest Berosus, who—although writing over seventy years after the reign of Artaxerxes II Mnemon—records that the emperor had been the first to make cult statues of divinities and have them placed in temples in many of the major cities of the empire (Berosus, III.65). Berosus also substantiates Herodotus when he says the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images. On the means of sacrifice, Herodotus adds "they raise no altar, light no fire, pour no libations." This sentence has been interpreted to identify a critical (but later) accretion to Zoroastrianism. An altar with a wood-burning fire and the Yasna service at which libations are poured are all clearly identifiable with modern Zoroastrianism, but apparently, were practices that had not yet developed in the mid-5th century. Boyce also assigns that development to the reign of Artaxerxes II (4th century BC), as an orthodox response to the innovation of the shrine cults.
Herodotus also observed that "no prayer or offering can be made without a magus present" but this should not be confused with what is today understood by the term "magus", that is a "magupat" (modern Persian: "mobed"), a Zoroastrian priest. Nor does Herodotus' description of the term as one of the tribes or castes of the Medes necessarily imply that these "magi" were Medians. They simply were a hereditary priesthood to be found all over Western Iran and although (originally) not associated with any one specific religion, they were traditionally responsible for all ritual and religious services. Although the unequivocal identification of the "magus" with Zoroastrianism came later (Sassanid era, 3rd–7th century CE), it is from Herodotus' "magus" of the mid-5th century that Zoroastrianism was subject to doctrinal modifications that are today considered to be revocations of the original teachings of the prophet. Also, many of the ritual practices described in the Avesta's "Vendidad" (such as exposure of the dead) were already practiced by the "magu" of Herodotus ' time.
Art and architecture.
"Achaemenid architecture" refers to the architectural achievements of the Achaemenid Persians manifesting in construction of spectacular cities utilized for governance and inhabitation, temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as Zoroastrian temples), and mausoleums erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the burial tomb of Cyrus the Great). The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Median, Assyrian, and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet maintaining a unique Persian identity seen in the finished products.
"Achaemenid art" refers to the artistic achievements of the Achaemenid Persians manifesting in construction of complicated frieze reliefs, crafting of precious metals (such as the Oxus Treasure), decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening, and out door decoration. It is critical to understand that although Persians borrowed techniques from all corners of their empire, it was not simply a combination of styles, but synthesis of a new unique Persian style. Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of the delicate metalwork found in Iron Age II times at Hasanlu and still earlier at Marlik.
One of the most amazing examples of both Achaemenid architecture and art is the grand palace of Persepolis, and its detailed workmanship, coupled with its grand scale. In describing the construction of his palace at Susa, Darius the Great records that:
This was imperial art on a scale the world had not seen before. Materials and artists were drawn from all corners of the empire, and thus tastes, styles, and motifs became mixed together in an eclectic art and architecture that in itself mirrored the Persian empire.
Legacy.
The Achaemenid Empire left a lasting impression on the heritage and the cultural identity of Asia and Middle East, as well as influencing the development and structure of future empires. In fact the Greeks and later on the Romans copied the best features of the Persian method of governing the empire, and vicariously adopted them.
Georg W. F. Hegel in his work "The Philosophy of History" introduces the Persian Empire as the "first empire that passed away" and its people as the "first historical people" in history. According to his account;
The famous American orientalist, Professor Arthur Upham Pope (1881–1969) said: "The western world has a vast unpaid debt to the Persian Civilization!"
Will Durant, the American historian and philosopher, during one his speeches, "Persia in the History of Civilization", as an address before the "Iran-America Society" in Tehran on 21 April 1948, stated:
Achaemenid kings and rulers.
Attested.
Early in the reign of Artaxerxes II, in 399 BC, the Persians lose control over Egypt. They regained control 57 years later – in 342 BC – when Artaxerxes III conquered Egypt.

Inachus phalangium

Inachus phalangium, Leach's spider crab, is a species of crab from the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. It is up to wide, and is very similar to other species in the genus "Inachus".
Description.
Large males may reach a carapace size of , and is brownish-yellow in colour. The carapace becomes narrower towards the front of the animal, and is often concealed by epibionts. "I. phalangium" resembles the closely related species "Inachus dorsettensis", but has less prominent spines on the carapace.
Distribution.
"I. phalangium" is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Norway in the north to West Africa and the Cape Verde islands in the south, and extending into the Mediterranean Sea. It lives at depths of .
Ecology.
"Inachus phalangium" lives commensally with the sea anemone "Anemonia sulcata" (snakelocks anemone). The crab gains protection from potential predators by sheltering beneath the anemone's stinging tentacles. The crab eats particles of food dropped by the sea anemone, and mucus from the surface of the anemone.
Taxonomy.
The earliest scientific description of Leach's spider crab may have been Carl Linnaeus' description of ""Cancer tribulus"" in the 12th edition of his "Systema Naturae" in 1767. Linnaeus' description was, however, too vague to allow the species to be confidently identified. That name is therefore a "nomen dubium", and it was suppressed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1964 at the request of Lipke Holthuis. The first valid description was Johan Christian Fabricius' publication of the name "Cancer phalangium" in his 1775 work "Systema Entomologiae". The name "Cancer phalangium" was later protected by being placed on the "Official List of Specific Names in Zoology".

Heavy Rocks (2011 album)

Heavy Rocks is the sixteenth studio album by the Japanese experimental band Boris. The album was released on May 24, 2011, through the label Sargent House. Its original release date was April 26, but this was pushed back. This album has the same name and cover style as their album released in 2002 called "Heavy Rocks", although the cover is purple instead of orange. The band brought back these elements because they "seek to redefine 'heavy' music in a culmination of the band's tireless efforts over the past two decades".
The album was released on the same day as "Attention Please", with which it shares the track "Aileron." It also shares different mixes of the songs "Jackson Head" and "Tu, La La" with "New Album".
Initial tracklist information had the song "8" listed as the second track, but the final release replaced it with "Leak -Truth, yesnoyesnoyes."
On March 29, 2011, Pitchfork Media released the song "Riot Sugar" in promotion for the album.
The vinyl edition features extended versions of "Missing Pieces" and "Czechoslovakia." An additional full length mix of "Czechoslovakia" with vocals by Tomáš Zakopal was released on a split 7" with his band, Saade.

Ganja Auto Plant

Ganja Auto Plant, is an auto assembly plant situated in the Ganja city in Azerbaijan. The factory was founded in 1986 for a production of run of 30,000 "GAZelle" vans according to the project brief. The commissioning was intended to end in 1989 but following a decision of Ministers Cabinets of USSR the construction of the factory was interrupted and the technological project was given to Bryansk automobile plant. The 256 hectares of territory and 50 hectares of production territory stayed without utilization for 15 years.
Construction of an automobile plant was considered by the government after Azerbaijan had obtained its independence. Since 1994 the giant and famous automobile companies of Italy, Korea, Japan, France and Germany have shown interest in the institution, but negotiations held with them ended without result.
Only in December 2004 Ganja automobile plant began its activity and the first car built at the factory was issued. In 2008 the plant produced about 600 cars and tractors.
History.
Construction of the plant began in 1986 under the name KiAZ (Kirovabad Automobile Zavod). The production capacity of the plant was designed to produce 30,000 cars. Construction of the plant for the project was supposed to end in 1989, but because of the collapse of the Soviet Union the construction and operation of the plant has been postponed indefinitely. In December 2004 it opened as the Gyandzha Auto Plant and the first car that came out of their production line was presented that year. In the year 2008 the factory produced about 600 vehicles from cars and tractors.
In parallel, this plant serves as one example of Azeri government to show progress in diversifying its economy, always dependent on oil and gas, and has been able to serve other purposes, in particular, to give political proaganda his government, but not to give any autosificiencia in its main weaknesses, such as the import of transport equipment other nations.
Despite the efforts made in this plant by Russian plants, the production is still very low, being just hundreds, where facility on the original idea could accommodate increased production.
Recently Moldova, Belarus and Russia investers have visited the plant in order to see the progress made and the production of their products in this factory.

<doc id="30927573" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30927573" title="Giovanni Riggi">
Giovanni Riggi

Giovanni "John the Eagle" Riggi (born 1925) is a New Jersey mobster and member of the DeCavalcante crime family since the 1940s, before the family had acquired its name. Riggi was the leader of the "Elizabeth crew" in the family when he was a Caporegime. He had been the acting boss during the 1970s and has been the official boss since around 1980. Riggi was incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) Devens, Massachusetts on extortion and labor racketeering convictions. He was released on November 27, 2012.
Ercole DiMeo, the named but unseen character from the HBO TV series The Sopranos, is supposedly based on Riggi.
Business Background.
John Riggi had been a business agent of the "International Association of Laborers and Hod Carriers", in New Jersey for years. He was promoted to the position of official boss of the DeCavalcante crime family (a crime family within the criminal world of "Cosa Nostra") with close ties to the Five Families of New York and represented at meetings of The Commission by the Genovese crime family, Riggi reaped the enormous benefits of large labor and construction racketeering, loansharking, illegal gambling activities as well as a large legitimate income. Riggi also had the family maintain their old traditions. Riggi established a close friendship with new Gambino crime family boss, John Gotti. It is thought that Riggi still runs the family from jail despite being a very sick man in his old age.
His release date is in late 2012, but he is due to stand trial for ordering the shooting and murder of Staten Island, New York resident Fred Weiss, a former journalist for the Staten Island Advance newspaper and real-estate developer in September 1989.
The murder was allegedly a favor for John Gotti, who was worried that Weiss was a government informant and that this would put the Gambino and DeCavalcante families at high risk. Weiss and two mob partners had purchased a vacant property in Staten Island and started illegally dumping large amounts of dangerous medical waste there. When local authorities uncovered the scheme and started investigating Weiss, the two mob families became nervous. Gotti, who worried that Weiss might become a government witness in exchange for leniency requested that the Decavalcantes murder Weiss to protect them. On September 11, 1989, Vincent Palermo and Anthony Capo as well as a crew of twelve other DeCavalcante associates in a convoy of four vehicles drove to the New York condominium of Weiss' girlfriend. As Weiss left the building and climbed into his car, Palermo and Capo got out of their vehicle, approached Weiss and murdered him by shooting him in the face multiple times. Both of them would become "made men" as a result of this.
Leading from jail.
While in jail, Riggi appointed a ruling panel to take control of the DeCavalcante crime family until his release, but the acting boss of the panel, Gaetano "Corky" Vastola was arrested and jailed as well. John D'Amato then appointed himself acting boss. D'Amato's reign was short, as it soon became clear that he had been recruited by the Gambino crime family and had been conspiring to murder Vastola. Later in 1991, D'Amato came into an argument with his girlfriend, who was also involved with Anthony Rotondo. She told Rotondo that when she and D'Amato were out at clubs during the evenings, D'Amato would be swinging and have sex with other men. Reportedly, Rotondo became quite upset that someone within the family was taking part in homosexual acts and shared it with the current administration members Giacomo Amari, the reputed underboss, and Stefano Vitabile, the powerful consigliere, who decided to have D'Amato murdered after informing the incarcerated Riggi. In January 1992, D'Amato was reported missing. His body has never been found, although US law enforcement recovered his car with some of his blood in it. Vincent Palermo, Anthony Capo and Anthony Rotondo would later testify about this murder against their former associates. In 2006, Philip Abramo, Giuseppe Schifilliti and Stefano Vitabile were sentenced to life imprisonment for their involvement in the murder. Riggi had another 8 years added to his sentence. He was incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center, Devens and was released November 27, 2012.
Family.
Riggi has a large family. It has been postulated that at least one of Riggi's sons is a "made man" within the DeCavalcante crime family. This is unproven and there is no source to confirm it.

Constitution of Zimbabwe

The Constitution of Zimbabwe is officially the supreme law of Zimbabwe. The independence constitution of 1980 was the result of the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement and is sometimes called the Lancaster Constitution. A proposed constitution, drafted by a constitutional convention, was defeated by a constitutional referendum during 2000.
In practise, after 2008, the 2008 power-sharing deal provided the structure for much of the government. The three political parties in Zimbabwe, ZANU-PF, MDC-T and MDC-N negotiated a new proposed constitution after a constitutional outreach program. The new constitution was approved in the referendum of 16 March 2013. The parliament approved it on 9 May 2013. Some of the new constitution's clauses do not take effect for 10 years.

Ahmad ibn Ridwan

Ahmad ibn Ridwan () (died 1607) better known as Ahmad Pasha was the governor of the Vilayet of Damascus in the early 17th century. Before that, he was governor of the Sanjak of Gaza, a subprovince of Damascus under the Ottoman Empire.
Governorship of Gaza.
Ahmad Pasha was the son of Ridwan ibn Mustafa Pasha who founded the Ridwan dynasty which governed southern Palestine for nearly two centuries. Ahmad acquired the governorship of Sanjak Gaza in 1585 following the death of Ridwan Pasha in Anatolia. Ahmad chose Gaza to be the center of his Ridwan dynasty. He continued his relatively autonomous rule of the district—which at times included Jerusalem and Nablus in central Palestine—until 1605. During this period, he was also given the honorary role of "amir al-hajj" by the Ottoman state.
Arab biographer Muhammad Muhibbi described Ahmad Pasha as a "courageous" and "brilliant" man with a great understanding of history and science. Poets of the time wrote songs praising his knowledge. During his rule as Gaza's governor, the city became a cultural center. Its religious significance was boosted by the governor's scholarly attitude and by the influence of his close friend and adviser Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, an important Islamic jurist in the region who he befriended in 1603.
Governorship of Damascus.
Unlike his father, Ahmad Pasha had to lobby for the position of "beylerbey" ("provincial governor") of the Vilayet of Damscus. According to Arab historian Rifaat Abu al-Haj, Ahmad had to send to gifts and large sums of money to "countless vezirs and bureaucrates in the Ottoman capital Istanbul before being awarded the province in 1601. During his rule, Ahmad Pasha became a patron of Muslim jurists and is known to have regularly consulted the '"ulema", high-ranking Muslim scholars, on provincial affairs. Abu al-Haj wrote by the time he had gained the governorship of Damascus, Ahmad had grown old. He died, while still in power, in 1607. Following his death, Ahmad's son Hasan "'Arab" Pasha inherited the governorship of Gaza and took part in putting down the revolt of Fakhr-al-Din II in modern-day Lebanon.

Charles-Daniel de Meuron

Charles-Daniel de Meuron (6 May 1738 - 4 April 1806) was the founder of a Swiss mercenary regiment, Regiment de Meuron, which worked in the service of the Dutch East India Company in Cape Town and Ceylon. Charles-Daniel was born in Neuchatel and joined the Swiss Guard. He rose to become a colonel and was made a count in 1763. In 1768, he was awarded the Croix du mérite militaire. A contract with the Dutch East India Company allowed him to create his own regiment. This regiment moved from France to Cape Town, before moving to Ceylon. The Regiment shifted alliance to the English in 1796 transferring Ceylon into the British Empire and then serving the English East India Company. In 1799, the Regiment de Meuron fought against Tipu Sultan in the Battle of Seringapatam. The regimental flag had the symbols of a sword and a mulberry tree. The sword represented military power while the mulberry tree, from which tapa cloth was made, is thought to have indicated his interest in objects of natural history. His collections of curiosities are now housed at the museum in Neuchatel.
The regiment was plagued with problems, partly from the prickly personality of the founder. Although hired by the Dutch, the Dutch saw the regiment as being favourable to the French. Charles-Daniel tried to impress upon the Dutch that he was against the French. He became very unpopular among his officers, many of whom mutinied, as well as the Governor of the Cape, Van Plettenberg. Even before the Regiment left for the Cape, they had an outbreak of smallpox at the Ile d'Oleron in the west of France. The subsequent shortfall of 380 men was made up by an intake of prisoners from jails in Paris. The original composition was made up of two-thirds Swiss and the remainder of Germans and others. The 800 strong regiment finally left France and a hurricane caused further delay during their journey to the Cape. They were reduced to half rations for eighty days and 300 men got scurvy and 103 died in en route. Twenty more died shortly after reaching cape Town. Some of the troops defected to join Boer farmers. De Meuron held the captain of the "Fier", d'Albarade, responsible and claimed that he had stocked the ship with illicit cargo and trading merchandise instead of sufficient provisions for the troops. This claim required the Dutch to hold the ship at the port for investigation. There were altercations between the French sailors and the remaining members of the Meuron Regiment resulting in the shooting of several sailors and causing trouble for the Dutch as there was nobody in control.
The remainder of Regiment was later moved from Cape Town to Ceylon using the other French ship, the "Hermione", to serve the Dutch. In the interim, the British agent Hugh Cleghorn in collaboration with Henry Dundas approached Charles-Daniel with a proposal and the regiment shifted its loyalty to the English. On the 14th of February, 1796 the Dutch in Ceylon surrendered with minimal resistance. Charles-Daniel received a sum of ₤4000 for the transfer and Cleghorn was paid ₤5000 and made Crown Secretary to Ceylon. In 1798, the Regiment entered full service of the British Army with 2 battalions, of 5 companies of infantry each. The Regiment took part in the battle of Seringapatnam on the side of Wellesley and helped in the successful seizure of Mysore from Tipu Sultan. Comte Charles-Daniel returned to Switzerland leaving command of the regiment to his brother Pierre-Frederick de Meuron. The Regiment remained in India until 1806, the same year in which Charles de Meuron died.

Al-Hamma Incident

The al-Hamma Incident () refers to an event which happened on April 4, 1951 and resulted in the death of seven IDF soldiers by Syrian military forces during an Israeli attempt to enforce its sovereignty over the demilitarized zone along the Syrian border.
Background.
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the main thrust of the Syrian invasion of the Galilee crossed the border at Al-Hamma. According to the 1949 armistice agreement between Israel and Syria, it was determined that a string of villages, including Al-Hamma, Nuqeib, Al-Samra in the Tiberias Subdistrict, and Kirad al-Baqqara and Kirad al-Ghannama further north in the Safad Subdistrict, would be included the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between Israel and Syria. The inhabitants and their property were formally protected by Article V of the Israeli-Syrian agreement of 20 July that year. However, according to Benny Morris, Israel wanted the 2,200 Palestinian inhabitants of those villages to move to Syria. The Israeli military thought that the inhabitants of the DMZ remained loyal to Syria and they suspected them of helping Syrian intelligence. Local Jewish settlers and law enforcement suspected the villagers of petty crimes. Morris also believes that Israeli settlers and settlement agencies coveted the land of the local Palestinians Arabs.
The incident.
Until 1951, Israel had never patrolled or occupied Al-Hamma. However, in the spring of that year, Israel decided to assert its sovereignty over the village. On 4 April that year, IDF General Staff (ignoring the protest from the Northern Command) send two patrol-vehicles to the village. The patrol was disguised as policemen, as Israel was not allowed to have soldiers in the DMZ. Seven Israeli soldiers were killed by the Syrians.
Reactions.
The following day, four Israel planes bombed the police station at Al-Hamma and a Syrian positions at Al Hadid. Two women were killed, and six people reported injured.
In addition, Israel decided to demolish the remaining houses in the Palestinian villages of Kirad al-Ghannama, Kirad al-Baqqara, Al-Samra and Nuqeib (in that order) to render the DMZ "clear of Arabs". Syria continued to control Al-Hamma until the 1967 Six-Day War. The enclave of Hamat Gader became a continuing source of friction between Israel and Syria.

Faith (novel)

Faith is a 1994 spy novel by Len Deighton. It is the first novel in the final trilogy of three about Bernard Samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). "Faith" is part of the "Faith, Hope and Charity" trilogy, being followed by "Hope" and "Charity". This trilogy is preceded by the "Game, Set and Match" and the "Hook, Line and Sinker" trilogies. Deighton's novel "Winter" (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. 
The novel is set in 1987, when Soviet control of Eastern Europe is beginning to falter. It picks up the story from the end of "Spy Line" and "Spy Sinker", with Fiona and Bernard Samson returning to London Central to rebuild their careers and marriage after recuperating with Bret Rensselaer in California.
Plot summary.
Dicky Cruyer, who is now acting Director of Operations, sends Bernard and another agent into East Germany to meet with Verdi, a KGB defector who has promised to supply access to the KGB mainframe and wanted to see Bernard. Upon discovering a corpse at the meeting point they realise that they have been set up. After killing a Stasi agent and being sheltered by one of Fiona's networks they escape back to West Berlin. Dicky is desperate for the Verdi operation to succeed in order to secure Operations permanently and angle for the soon to be vacant Deputy Director General position. Fiona is now working for Dicky and backing the operation because VERDI has promised to bring information about the death of her sister Tessa during Fiona's escape from the East. Others high-up in the SIS are determined to block the operation. 
Bernard knows Verdi from the old days in Berlin, doesn't trust him and isn't sure about the operation but now he must work with his old friend Werner Volkman to find out what is really going on and bring Verdi safely to London. Along the way Bernard has to deal with the usual office politics, enemy agents, his fragile wife, his ex-mistress Gloria, Dicky's wife's seduction by a KGB operative and Tessa's husband's attempts to find out who was really responsible for her death and make them pay. 
Bret makes a surprise return to London to take the Deputy Director General position. He appoints Gloria as his assistant and promises a major clean out of London Central. Gloria tells Bernard she is worried that files about her father's and Bernard's connection with Fiona's mission are being illegally erased from top secret databases. 
Verdi tells Bernard the corpse at the meeting point was Timmermann, a freelance agent working for George and Fiona who was nosing around about Tessa and had to be eliminated, something Bret had tried to inform Bernard of via a cryptic message. Verdi is safely brought to London to finalise the deal where he hands over Tessa's post mortem report as promised. Verdi then spins a fanciful story to Bernard that the report is a fake and that Tessa is really still alive and being held captive in East Germany; something Bernard forces Werner to keep secret. Verdi is then killed by a sniper and everyone faces an official inquiry into the mission's failure.

Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.

Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. is a private beer company that began production on December 31, 2010 and is located in the Cincinnati, Ohio neighborhood of Over-the-Rhine. Almost all of its production is contracted out to other breweries in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. However a brewpub along the Ohio River opened in 2012 with capacity to brew all of the beer for the restaurant, and new production brewery opened in Over-the-Rhine in 2013 with an eventual capacity of 400,000 barrels each year. It has the same name as a former company that operated from the mid-1800s until Prohibition.
Hudepohl Brewing Company is wholly owned by the Christian Moerlein Brewing Company.
History.
Christian Moerlein was a Bavarian immigrant born in Truppach, Bavaria in 1818. He traveled to America in 1841 after becoming an apprentice brewer and blacksmith. He settled in the neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio known as Over-the-Rhine. Over-the-Rhine was a heavily populated neighborhood of mostly Germans and German-Americans. In 1853, Christian Moerlein opened the Christian Moerlein Brewing Company.
In its first year of production, the Christian Moerlein Brewing Company produced one thousand barrels of beer. In just over a decade, twenty-six thousand barrels were being produced and Christian Moerlein fast became the most prominent brewer in the city of Cincinnati. When production reached its peak, Christian Moerlein beer was being shipped to places as far as Europe and South America, and was the only Cincinnati beer exported internationally. Moerlein died in 1897, but the company continued until Prohibition began. The company never recovered from Prohibition, and sat idle until the brand was reintroduced in 1981 by the Hudepohl Brewing Company.
The new Christian Moerlein Brewing Company was part of the craft beer movement. The Christian Moerlein Select Lager became the first American beer to certifiably pass the strict Reinheitsgebot, or Bavarian Purity Law of 1516.
The modern company.
In 2004, the Christian Moerlein brand was purchased by Greater Cincinnati resident Greg Hardman. Over a period of five years, Hardman also acquired Hudepohl, Burger, and Little Kings, the best-known of the Cincinnati brands. He purchased not only those, but 63 other long-forgotten brand names, such as Top Hat, Hauck, and Windisch-Muhlhauser, bringing many of the historical Cincinnati Brands under the same roof. Since the purchase, Christian Moerlein has reintroduced several classic Cincinnati brands including Hudepohl and Burger.
In 2010, Hardman purchased the former Husman Potato Chip factory at 1621 Moore Street. The location is just blocks from the original site of Christian Moerlein in Over-the-Rhine. The first beer brewed in the new location was the 1861 Porter, which was made available on New Year's Eve 2010, in recognition of the 150th anniversary of Cincinnati's longest continuously running bar, Arnold's Bar and Grill.
A Christian Moerlein Lager House restaurant was opened on the Banks development in February 2012, operated by the Cunningham Restaurant Group. This sits along the new Riverfront Park in Downtown Cincinnati and adjacent to Great American Ball Park, home of the Cincinnati Reds. The site is two stories tall and has multiple beer gardens. Approximately 500 seats are inside and an additional 600 can be seated outside. A large beer garden adjoins an outdoor event lawn on the new Riverfront Park. The building serves as a restaurant and a working microbrewery. Food featured on the menu replicates 19th-century German cuisine prominent in Over-the-Rhine's historic beginnings. The site provides live entertainment.
In 2013 a production brewery opened up at 1621 Moore Street in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. It is in the site of the historic Kauffman Brewery and a former Husman Potato Chip factory. The brewery has the capacity to brew 15,000 barrels in its first year (2013) and eventually could reach a capacity of 400,000 barrels/year on the site as demand increases.

Manduca lefeburii

Manduca lefeburii is a moth of the Sphingidae family. It is found from Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil.
The wingspan is 89-110 mm. It is similar in appearance to several other members of the "Manduca" genus, but a number of differences distinguish it from "Manduca andicola", "Manduca incisa" and "Manduca jasminearum", to which it most closely compares, particularly in its uniform forewing upperside with a conspicuous dark band.
There are at least two generations per year in Costa Rica with adults on wing from May to June and again from August to December. In Bolivia, adults have been recorded from October to December.
The larvae feed on "Casearia arguta", "Casearia sylvestris" and "Casearia corymbosa".

Knuckleheads Saloon

Knuckleheads Saloon is a music venue in Kansas City, Missouri. The facility is a complex of three stages - a large outdoor stage featuring a converted caboose to one side as a VIP seating area, a 220 seat indoor stage and a 50 seat lounge known as the "Retro Room". The last doubles as a blues music oriented church on Wednesday evenings when it is renamed the "Gospel Lounge". Live music can be presented on all three stages at once. The venue presents live music five nights of the week, Wednesday through Sunday, with occasional Tuesday concerts.
History.
The original building was built in 1887 as a railroad boardinghouse, across the street from the original location of early Kansas City amusement park Electric Park. A very active train track runs close by the outdoor stage - performers have had to become accustomed to train whistles blowing during shows. Singer-songwriter Joe Ely was performing his song "Boxcar" on the outdoor stage when a train came by, blowing its whistle at the right point in the song. Ely said he had "...waited 20 years for a train to come by at the perfect timing".
Knucklehead's Saloon is owned by Frank & Mary Hicks, who owned an auto body shop called Mid-City Collision Repair. They opened a Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealership across the street from Mid-City in 1997 called "F.O.G. Cycles" (an acronym for "Fucking Old Guys"), and sponsored street parties as a promotional tool, giving away free beer. In 2001, Hicks obtained a liquor license and the bar opened as Knucklehead's Saloon in homage to a trio of his cycling friends, calling themselves The Three Stooges. In 2004, Hicks closed F.O.G. Cycles to concentrate on the club. Mid-City has a mural painted on the wall facing Knuckleheads featuring rock, blues and country icons Elvis Presley, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Hank Williams Sr.
Location.
The location in the East Bottoms on Rochester Street, bordered on the east by Montgall Ave, on the east by the North Chestnut Trafficway overpass and the south by railroad tracks can be difficult to find. The entire East Bottoms area is separated from Front Street and the highway system on the north by five very active sets of train tracks. GPS systems and most mapping web sites will steer the traveler to access the venue via Front Street, and do not take the train tracks into consideration.
It is generally quicker to approach the venue via North Chestnut Trafficway from the south
Performers.
Zydeco band Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band recorded their live album Live at Knuckleheads, Kansas City and an accompanying DVD in 2007, as did Cadillac Flambe in 2010.
The venue hosts several hundred performers every year, with concerts five nights a week, with two or three different stages operating in a single night.
Well known acts who have played Knuckleheads include Leon Russell, Nick Lowe, Edgar Winter and his brother Johnny Winter, Ray Price, Billy Joe Shaver, Dale Watson, Kinky Friedman, Rodney Crowell and David Lindley.
Advance tickets are sold for concerts by most of the national and international acts playing the venue via eTix.
Gospel Lounge.
Reverend Carl Butler of the New Song Christian Fellowship church started holding church services in 2009 on Wednesday nights in the smallest of Knuckleheads' three performance spaces. They are intended to be for those who work late on Saturday nights, what Butler describes as "a church geared toward service-industry people." Butler is a guitarist and recovering drug abuser and mixes music and preaching, playing "...everything from Merle Haggard to Motown".
The last Friday of every month features a performance at 7:00 PM by Elvis Tribute Artist Jeff Bergen in the Retro Room. Nationally known artists have been playing multiple shows at Knuckleheads, often playing their regular electric show on the main stage, and a second, more intimate acoustic show in the Retro Room.
Jam sessions.
The venue hosts no-cover open jams on weekends, allowing amateur musicians to play on stage with professionals.
Facilities.
The outdoor stage is equipped with a 40 channel mixing board, the indoor stage has a slightly smaller 36 channel board and the Retro Room/Gospel Lounge has a 16 channel board.
The venue has television screens and projectors in every public and performer area to present what is happening on the various stages, or an in-house calendar of upcoming events. Each stage has three cameras feeding through a switch to a NewTek Tricaster video mixer that drives the in-house video and an optional UStream web stream.
Honors.
Knuckleheads was given the Blues Foundation's "Keeping Blues Alive" award as Best Blues Club in 2008, calling it "...the place to see live Blues in Kansas City" and "...a premier stop for Blues artists traveling through the Midwest".
Starting in 2005, it has won Best Blues Club from the readers of the Kansas City alternative paper The Pitch, and has won that award for each of the following six years. Bill Brownlee of the Kansas City Star, in a review of a concert by Leon Russell, said "Knuckleheads is Kansas City's premier roots music venue of the last 30 years."

<doc id="30927934" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30927934" title="Landrush period">
Landrush period

A landrush period is the time during which domain names are available for registration, usually to a closed group (usually through a premium price), to entities that do not own a trademark in the name they wish to register, for example generic terms like "loan" or "car", and thus would not qualify for registration during the sunrise period. Orders may or may not be treated on a first-come-first-served basis. This period follows the sunrise period just after the launch of a new top-level domain or second-level domain during which, for example, owners of trademarks may register a domain name containing the owned mark, but a landrush period precedes a period of general availability, when any qualifying entity can register any name on a first come first-served basis.
Launch Phase.
As a launches occur, gTLDs will follow a cycle of different launch phases. All launch phases start with the Sunrise Period, there is flexibility with the other stages.
Sunrise Period.
The Sunrise period is often a 30 day (or longer) phase during which trademark owners can purchase domain names before they are offered to the general public. This period of time allows for companies to keep the domain name associated with their brand before someone can publicly purchase the domain. Often domains such as info, mobi, pk, and eu are picked up by companies during the sunrise period that proceeds the larger landrush period. In order to participate in the sunrise period, one has to be a registered trademark holder with the Trademark Clearing House. The allowance of time for each registered domain name in the sunrise period is two years. After that, the trademark holder needs to reclaim their domain.
Landrush Period.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) defines the landrush period as the time between the Sunrise Period and General availability during which applications for a domain name may be received from any interested eligible party.
Registries often have the option of including a landrush period, but this process is not mandatory. In the landrush period registration is open to everyone, but the registration is sold at a high price than the regular price. Also some domains during a landrush period could be auctioned or on a "first come, first-served" basis.
The only domain not offered to everybody during the landrush period is Premium Domains. Each registry reserves the right to reserve high value or "Premium" domains and to sell or auction those domains at elevated prices.
On average a Landrush Period will last about 30 days and in this period applications for domain names may be received from any interested and eligible party before it is open for general availability.
In 2012 a digital land rush was expected because of a possible creation of new domain names and web addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit, is currently responsible for regulation of domain names, and ICANN predicted a landrush period for the new domain names. ICANN surveyed the public for new possible names, and the organization had a goal of trying to expand new top-level domain names. As new domain names are created, ICANN hopes for many overseers to sell their name to registrars. According to ICANN, the front-runner for a new domain name is ".shop" and the goal is to increase supply and demand for domain names. A landrush period will occur over the creation of new domain names because as the new domain names are created, overseers will sell their domain names, which will cause businesses and individuals to rush to buy new names. This increase in demand causes a landrush period and leads to increase consumption of domain names. In addition to an increase of demand in a landrush period, ICANN hopes to have a greater landrush period than ".jobs", which was a failure.
ICANN's Procedure for Landrush.
According to The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in order to participate in a Landrush period applicants must submit an application for a domain name that was not previously allocated, not eligible for allocation, and is not subject of an application that is being currently processed by the auction provider. Also multiple applications for the same domain name will be settle with an auction. In addition, a claims period will be in effect during the entire duration of the Landrush period and the applicant must accept the information contained within a Claim Notice.
General Availability Period.
The General Availability phase follows all Sunrise and Landrush periods. This is an open period based on the "first come, first served" policy to the public. Typically, 90 calendar days after General Availability opens for each new gLTD, registries must provide Trademark Claims.
ICANN defines General Availability is the point in time following which requests to register a domain name may be received from any eligible part on the same "first come, first served" basis. Another name for General Availability is also General Registration.
Major Landrush Periods.
First Major Landrush.
Though generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were first established in 1984, the first major domain landrush was mostly centered around the dot-com bubble, which took place from 1997 until 2003. With the release of the official generic top-level domains, dot-com companies began to arise. This bubble involved investors pouring money into internet startups during the 1990s with hopes that those companies would one day become profitable. These companies were solely based on the World Wide Web, but usually had no strategic business model to support any revenue stream. The result was the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which ultimately ended the first major landrush period.
A large part of the first major landrush was cybersquatting, a practice in which individuals strategically purchase high-value domain names for resale at a higher price. However, this practice was made illegal with the passage of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in 1999. There are companies, such as DomainMarket.com, based around similar practices yet are still considered legal ventures.
Second Major Landrush.
February 4, 2014, marked the beginning of the second major domain landrush. This landrush commenced the production of new web addresses, which has not occurred since 2000, when ICANN last accepted applications for top-level domains.The process of applying for new domain names runs through ICANN, the non-profit that manages several Internet-related tasks. ICANN’s process can be an expensive one, demanding an initial fee of $185,000. Additionally, the application process is a lengthy one, in which ICANN believes could take up to a year. Furthermore, the domain names are not simply given to anyone. ICANN reviews critical details regarding applicants’ financial stability, technical abilities and their intentions with the domain.
Andy Vuong of the "Denver Post" wrote that some of these new domains will, "target specific industries, such as .attorney and .ski, or social causes, such as .hiv, which will be dedicated to sites that contribute to the fight against HIV and AIDS".
The essential reason to create new gTLDs is due to the fact that there are not enough domain names available for businesses or individuals to create sensible and logical URLs. A vast amount of .com’s are in use already, and individuals and businesses are having difficulties in creating a fitting and simple domain. ICANN’s Cyrus Namazi told Quartz that, “We’ve gone from an average of four or five letters in a second-level domain to something in excess of 14 to find what you’re looking for”.
One main argument against the creation of new domains is that the days of individuals typing in full URLs is slowly dying out. For example, internet browsers such as Google Chrome’s use an address bar which doubles as a search field.
Global Landrush Periods.
The .eu Landrush Period.
One of the major landrush periods that occurred was the .eu TLD (top level domain). The “.eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union” and it was approved in March 2005. It is currently one of the largest European ccTLD. The sunrise period for this domain was divided into two separate parts—the first opened on December 7, 2005, while the second began on February 7, 2006. The first phase was meant for “registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names” leaving the second phase open to “company, trade, and personal names”.
After the sunrise period comes the landrush, which, for .eu, occurred on April 7, 2006, when registration for the domain became possible for “non-trademark holders”. In order to request a domain, people had registrars place their requests into a long queue. Many registrars were backed up with too many requests, so registering for a domain essentially became a game. People would figure out which registrars had already completed many requests, which left these registrars with few requests, and “allow people to ‘beat the queue.’” The way that EURid (European Registry for Internet Domains) designed the land rush for the .eu domain allowed for over 700,000 domains to be registered within the first 4 hours. Four months later, in August 2006, there were 2 million registered .eu domains.
The process that EURid created for this domain was criticized for using “phantom” registrars. The difference between something known as a “phantom” registrar and a regular, official registrar, is that an official registrar has only one chance to register a specific domain, while a “phantom” registrar crowds out the .eu domain and has multiple opportunities to register the same domain. This suspicion arose due to 400 registered LLC companies that had similar addresses and contact information. Bringing this realization to the public's attention was the founder of Go Daddy who felt that these 400 companies were classified as "phantom registrars 'created to hijack the .EU land rush.'"

Opuntia aciculata

Opuntia aciculata, also called Chenille prickly pear, old man's whiskers and cowboy’s red whiskers, is a perennial dicot and an attractive ornamental cactus native to Texas. It belongs to the genus "Opuntia" prickly pear cacti. It is also widespread in Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas (North Mexico).
It was reported from Nuevo León, Mexico, according to D. Weniger in 1970. The species name "aciculata" derives from many sources: the Latin word "acicula" which means “a small pin for a headdress”, and the adjectival suffix for nouns "atus", meaning possessive of or likeness to something (with, shaped, made), while for verb participles it means a completed action. Chenille prickly pear, one of its vernacular names, comes for the fringe of spines around the edge of the pad. The specific name also means "covered with small pins".
Physical description.
This plant grows numerous stems covered with spines. The stems have segments partly rounded at the apex. They are faded and dull grey-green, more or less glaucous. They measure 10–20 cm in length. The leaves are acicular and ephemeral. The aeroles are often spineless with symmetrical regularity of them on the body. They are large, widely separated.
It has numerous glochids or microspines, 3–12 mm long, acicular, slender, spreading, forming a dense cluster. They are normally golden yellow to dark red in colour. It has often no spines, or rarely one to three, which are reflexed. They are of a yellowish or toasted colour with a brownish base, up to 3 cm in length. They are often folded and seemingly deciduous. 
It has broad, point-tipped blossoms colored golden yellow, orange, or red and of diameter 8–10 cm. Several sources report the flowers as being yellow in color, but the plants in cultivation usually have bright red-orange flowers, and sometimes the centre is greenish. Petals are broad-rounded or retuse, filaments are yellowish and the stigma dull yellowish with eight to 10 green lobes. They mostly flower in early summer or spring. The plant's fruits are usually pear-shaped, covered with fine spines and glochids, and are purple or green.
Distribution and habitat.
It grows in dry hills mainly on stony outcrops, often in small colonies usually to the exclusion of other plants. It is widespread in southern North America, to the Isthmus of Panama. However, it is actually native to Chihuahuan Desert (Texas) and northern Mexico.
Ecology.
Like its other cactus relatives, this deciduous and succulent species also has it leaves reduced to spines to reduce excess transpiration, which helps it to survive by conserving water in the hot climate of Texas, in southwestern United States, and North Mexico. This adaptation also helps in defending itself from being consumed by any herbivores there. It has the special ability to propagate from woody or softwood stem cuttings. It can even propagate by cuttings of leaf pads at any time in the growing season, allowing the cut surface to callus over before planting. This cactus can survive healthily and produce good many flowers only if it is fully exposed to the sun. They can also tolerate temperatures from −5 to −12°C.
Uses.
The fruits are edible and the soft pads ("nopales") can be cooked as vegetables. It also can be used to treat dyspepsia, mumps, or swelling, and in veterinary it is used to treat bruises. After burning of spines, the pads can serve as a good feed for cattle.

Bonang Highway

The road known as the Bonang Highway (also the "Old Bonang Highway") is a rural, C class, road in south-eastern Australia, with a mostly gravel surface, running generally south-north. It links the Gippsland region coastal town of Orbost, Victoria and the highland Monaro region town of Bombala, New South Wales.
Denoted as rural route C612, it passes through the settlements of Nurran, Goongerah, and Bonang in Victoria and the town Delegate in New South Wales in the Snowy Mountains of the Great Dividing Range. The road runs through valleys to the east of the Snowy River, that flows through Orbost. However, the Princes Highway crosses the river at Orbost and the Bonang Highway begins on the river's eastern bank, running parallel to it for only about .
The surface of the Bonang Highway is mostly well-maintained gravel, except around the New South Wales-Victoria border, between Bombala and Delegate, where it is asphalt. Due its unsealed surface and its narrow, twisting route, following steep sides of ridges and creeks, the road provides a slower journey (nearly 3 hours, as opposed to 1.75 hours) compared with the equal distance of the Princes Highway (A1 - Orbost to Cann River) and Monaro Highway (B23 - Cann River to Bombala) route. The loop from Orbost to Bombala and returning via the Monaro Highway is well known to motorbike riders as a scenic but difficult ride.
History.
The road was established to allow access for people going to the gold mining in the Bendoc area south of Delegate after 1852, and as an access road for logging and other forestry activities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is still primarily used for access to forest plantations in the Victorian State Forest areas adjoining the Snowy River National Park to its west and Erninundra National Park to its east. The road gives access to the Valley of the Giants area where the old-growth forest is a tourist attraction.
Aboriginal lands.
The road passes through the land of three Australian Aborigine peoples, the Krauatungalung people in the coastal lowlands and the Bidawal people in the highlands, and the Ngarigo people in the Monaro region.
The Snowy River Bandit.
The road cuts through the region frequented by the Snowy River Bandit (also ‘The Butcher’s Ridge Bandit’), perhaps Australia's last "bushranger", who frequented the wild forests of the area in 1940 and robbed people of food and clothing at gunpoint at isolated houses and on the roads. He was finally arrested on 20 December 1940 by Victoria Police constables, after being discovered by timber workers who saw his morning fire. He was discovered to be Alan Torney (1911-?) who had earlier been determined to be insane and was an escapee from a mental hospital at Goulburn, New South Wales.

Nickelhütte Aue

The Nickelhütte Aue is a modern manufacturing site in East Germany for pure non-ferrous metals like nickel, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, vanadium and tungsten. It is descended from the historic Niederpfannenstiel Blue Colour Works (), a paintworks that was founded in 1635 by Veit Hans Schnorr in Pfannenstiel near Aue.
Der Handel mit den Kobalterzen und den daraus hergestellten Farbstoffen versprach gute Gewinne und wurde unter strengste Kontrolle des sächsischen Kurfürsten gestellt, sogar ein Inspektor für die Blaufarbenwerke wurde bestellt. Kobaltdiebe oder "Privatexporteure" mussten sogar mit der Todesstrafe rechnen. Mit der Erhebung der "Zwanzigsten"-Steuer ab 1602 garantierten die Werke dem Kurfürsten ein gut gefülltes Staatssäckel. Aufgrund der erfolgreichen Geschäfte der sächsischen Blaufarbenwerke wurde der Kobaltkontrakt bis 1700 achtmal erneuert, wobei auch die Fragen der Herstellung und des Vertriebs von Wismut mit einbezogen wurden.
Als in der Porzellanmanufaktur zu Meißen das sächsische Porzellan ab 1710 hergestellt werden konnte, erlangte das schöne "Kobaltblau" aus dem Erzgebirge eine bedeutende Rolle für den Handel mit feinem Tafelgeschirr.
Der schwedische Wissenschaftler Georg Brandt konnte Kobalt 1735, genau 100 Jahre nach der Gründung des ersten Blaufarbenwerkes, erstmals in Reinform isolieren.
Das zuerst abgeschiedene Wismut war ein zweiter wichtiger Handelsartikel der Blaufarbenwerke.
Die Blaufarbenwerker.
In den Blaufarbenwerken wurden sowohl gelernte Arbeiter wie Farbmüller und Farbmeister als auch ungelernte Arbeitskräfte, "Farbburschen", beschäftigt. Die Arbeiter erhielten im Verhältnis zu den großen Gewinnen der Besitzer nur einen geringen Wochenlohn. Das in jahrelanger Tätigkeit erworbene Fachwissen in der Farbherstellung, in der Bedienung der Schmelzöfen und der Energieanlagen führte zur Entstehung eines Facharbeiterstamms, der auch auf den Erhalt bergbaulicher Traditionen achtete. Mit einem typischen Farbenwerker-Habit, einem weißen Leinenkittel, engen weißen Hosen, blauer Schürze, Leinenhemd mit blauem Kragen, einem schwarzen Schachthut mit Nackentuch und Sachsenkokarde, nahm man gemeinsam an Bergparaden teil. Zur Paradeuniform gehörten auch die Arbeitsgeräte Schöpflöffel, Krücke, Kratze und Rührscheit. Höher gestellte Farbenwerker trugen zusätzlich blaugraue Paradejacken mit goldenen Borten.
Bemerkenswert ist die 1717 hier im Blaufarbenwerk Pfannenstiel eingeführte Betriebskrankenkasse, die als die erste in Deutschland gegründete gilt. Anteilige Einzahlungen der Farbwerker und Werksbesitzer sowie die Zuführung von Trink- und Strafgeldern bildeten die finanzielle Grundlage. Dafür zahlte die Kasse bei längeren Krankheiten Krankengeld und im Todesfall Sterbegeld und eine kleine Rente an die Hinterbliebenen.
Eine Reihe hervorragender Persönlichkeiten machte sich um das Blaufarbenwerk verdient, darunter der Gründer des Werkes, dessen Ehefrau Rosina Schnorr, die das Werk nach der Verschleppung des Besitzers erfolgreich weiter führte, und deren Sohn Veit Hans Schnorr von Carolsfeld, der als Kaufmann den Fortbestand sicherte. Der "Blaufarbenwerksfaktor" Kurt Alexander Winkler, der die Nickelerzeugung aus den vorhandenen Erzen einführte, und dessen Sohn Clemens Alexander Winkler, der Verfahren zur Unschädlichmachung der entstehenden Abgase entwickelte, spielten in der Geschichte des Niederpfannenstieler Werkes ebenfalls eine bedeutende Rolle.
Aus dem Blaufarbenwerk wird die Nickelhütte.
Im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert wurden auch in anderen europäischen Ländern Kobalterze gefunden und weiterverarbeitet. Dadurch ging die Nachfrage nach den Kobaltfarben aus den Fabriken im Erzgebirge zurück. Außerdem hatten Wissenschaftler in England, Frankreich und Holland das preiswerte künstliche "Ultramarin" entwickelt, das aus Ton, Quarz, Soda, Schwefel und Holzkohle hergestellt wurde und die Smalte-Herstellung ab Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts größtenteils ablöste.
Durch das Wirken von Kurt Alexander Winkler und Ernst August Geitner blieb das Pfannenstieler Farbenwerk trotz des verschlechterten Absatzes erhalten. Geitner stellte 1823 erstmals eine "Argentan" genannte Legierung aus einer Mischung von Kupfer, Nickel und Zink her, die für die Herstellung von nichtrostenden und preiswerten Bestecken und metallenem Tafelgeschirr gut geeignet war. Durch die Belieferung neu entstandener Besteckfabriken in Aue mit Nickel ab 1849 erfuhr das Blaufarbenwerk einen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung. Zugleich behielten die beiden Privat-Blaufarbenwerke das Monopol der Kobaltfarbenproduktion. 1885 wurde auf dem Gelände in Niederpfannenstiel eine zweite Smalte-Fabrikationsanlage in Betrieb genommen und die Anzahl der Mitarbeiter auf 80 erhöht.
Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts wurde ein neues Verfahren entwickelt, mit dem Reinstmetalle aus früheren Haldengesteinen gewonnen werden konnten. Neue Schmelzprozesse mit modernen Herdflammöfen verbesserten ab 1914 die Ausbeute und die Arbeitsbedingungen.
In der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus nahm das mittlerweile "Nickelhütte" genannte Werk die zusätzliche Produktion von Kupfer, Cupral (ein Pflanzenschutzmittel für Gemüse, speziell für Kartoffelpflanzen), Natriumarsenit (ein giftiges Stäubemittel gegen tierische Schädlinge) und Kohletabletten auf. Die Nickelhütte wurde als kriegswichtige Fabrik eingestuft und die Belegschaft vom Wehrdienst freigestellt.
Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs fiel die Nickelhütte unter die sowjetische Besatzung. Wichtige Betriebsanlagen wie die Energieversorgung, die Flammofenhalle, die Nickelelektrolyse und die Pflanzenschutzmittelproduktionsanlagen wurden weiterbetrieben. Die restlichen Betriebsteile wurden mit einem Bretterzaun und Wachtürmen abgetrennt und gesichert und für die Aufbereitung von Wismut und Uranerzen genutzt. Weitere Gebäude wurden auf dem Gelände errichtet. Bis 1958 gehörte dieser Teil der Nickelhütte als "Objekt 100" zu den hochwichtigen-->

<doc id="30927984" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30927984" title="Hanyut (film)">
Hanyut (film)

Hanyut is a Malay film based upon the Joseph Conrad novel, "Almayer's Folly". The movie, written and directed by U-Wei Haji Saari, comprises adventure, drama, romance, conflict and suspense.
Story.
Based on Joseph Conrad's first novel, the movie tells the story of a Dutch trader, Almayer, struggling to survive in Malaysia at the turn of the 19th century. Almayer's dream of finding a mythical gold mountain is at odds with his plotting wife, colonial authorities, the political machinations of a local chief with Arab traders, and his daughter's love for a freedom-fighting Malay prince.
Synopsis.
Almayer is a lone Dutch trader grubbing to survive in colonial Malaysia. He sends his 10-year-old daughter Nina to Singapore to be educated as a Westerner, much to the distress of her mother, Mem, a local woman of Betawi origin. The couple stop speaking to each other as a result.
When Nina returns as a beautiful woman ten years later, she finds the family home and business in dire straits because of Almayer's obsession with finding gold in the mountains. Her return rekindles interest in the Almayer household, bringing in new business that allows Almayer to build a lavish new house in his compound.
Nina's presence attracts a number of suitors, including the nephew of a prominent Arab who asks for Nina’s hand in marriage. Almayer rejects the proposal, however, igniting an animosity between the traders that helps lead to Almayer's later downfall. Almayer guards Nina jealously as he sees her as an important part of his unrealistic dreams. He believes her beauty, combined with the gold he expects to unearth, will help him build a trading empire and fulfill his fantasy of a glorious future back in Europe, a world he has never seen.
A handsome Malay prince and trader named Dain Maroola enters the scene. Dain wants to buy gunpowder through Almayer. Almayer doesn’t question why the man wants explosives. Dain manipulates him with tales of the legendary gold mountain of which he claims to know the location.
As Almayer’s trading post prospers, he believes he is in reach of his dreams and readies boats and equipment for his gold-seeking expedition. In his fanaticism, he doesn’t notice Dain and Nina fall in love.
Mother Mem knows Almayer won't tolerate such a union. Given the deep animosity she feels toward her husband, she fuels and encourages the relationship while keeping Almayer in the dark.
Dain turns out to be a Malay freedom fighter who uses the purchased gunpowder to blow up a Dutch vessel at the mouth of the river. Now an outlaw, the British and Dutch military hunt along the river.
When Dain's men are attacked by colonial forces during a violent tropical storm, Dain is believed killed. Almayer fears he has lost his chances to find gold and goes on an alcohol-fueled binge. He doesn't know that Dain faked his own death and eloped with Nina. When he learns the truth from Mem, Almayer heads off in pursuit of the couple up river, determined that his daughter will not leave for a Malay.
When Almayer finds the couple, he's unable to convince his daughter to return. Heartbroken, he helps them escape and returns to his new house, which he burns down. Alienated and distraught, he is left with only his shattered dreams and the burned ruins of "Almayer's Folly".
Director’s statement.
"Hanyut" is a story about a cosmopolitan society living and working together along a riverbank somewhere in Malaysia. It attracted many sea travelers seeking opportunity and rewards.
It gives us a window into the Malay society in Malaysia in the late 19th century: A highly competitive mix of indigenous Malays, tribal aborigines, Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Chinese living and working together.
Although the book starts out as though it is from the perspective of the European protagonist, the narrative is dynamic. By the end of the story the protagonist (and the audience) discover the understanding of his own insignificance.
In the beginning of the story Almayer appears to be at the center of society, but in the end we see that he is very much peripheral and alienated, and that the real cultural, political and economic life of the community is located elsewhere and involves other people besides himself.

Jax Panik

Jax Panik is a South African hyper pop band from Bellville, South Africa now relocated to Cape Town.
History.
Jax Panik was started as a parody. When the founding members, Jacobus van Heerden and Johnny de Ridder, wanted to create a mock pop star/group against all the traditional rock bands that ruled South Africa at that time. That's how Jax Panik was born.
Jax Panik was the guy who did things differently. Back then he refused to play live, only distributing music online, making use of fan content and using social media/networks to promote himself.
By 2007, the first album "Cigarettes & Cinnamon" was completed and in 2008 released independently in South Africa. Following the typical pop blueprint, 'oohs', 'aahs' and 'baby' can be heard throughout the album. Throughout 2008 tracks like "Hit or Miss", "Cigarettes & Cinnamon" and "Russian Roulette" did well on regional and campus radio stations, even reaching poll spots on charts. Other noteworthy achievements during this period include an MTV Africa Viewer’s Choice Award nomination.
I Am Jax Panik.
2010 meant change for Jax Panik, and the release of the new full length album "I Am Jax Panik".
This is also the first year that Jax Panik played live, with 4 members and their masks.
The Mask.
The mask was introduced to keep the face behind the mask a secret. Only because Jax Panik is a third person. One with many faces and guises. The mask is usually white with 'I Am Jax Panik' written in black and vice versa. In mid-2011 it was decided that only the Jax Panik DJ, Deon van Zyl, wears the mask at live performances.

As You Drown (formerly known as Ethereal) is a death metal band formed in Borås, Sweden in the winter of 2003.
History.
The band was released a demos between 2003-2005 and managed to performed some shows supporting fellow European metal bands like Entombed and Vader before encountering their first set of lineup changes.
In 2005 Åkerström decided to focus on his guitar playing, opting to bring in Christopher Ranasen to pick up his vocal duties. They also brought in bassist Robert Karlsson to replace Persson, who was leaving the band to study in Japan. With the lineup solidified, the band further honed its sound, a blend of the technical ferocity of Behemoth with the heaviness of Morbid Angel. In 2007 the band released a demo album titled Demo 2007. In 2008 the band switched singers once again, replacing Ranasen with ex-Shadowbuilder vocalist Henrik Blomqvist. With a new recording project underway and a new lineup, the band decided to change its name, dropping Ethereal and being reborn with its current moniker, As You Drown. In 2009, their debut album, "Reflection", was released in Europe and the U.S. by Metal Blade Records in 2009. They are currently signed to Metal Blade Records.

<doc id="30928084" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30928084" title="Dystopian Wars">
Dystopian Wars

Dystopian Wars is a Victorian super science-fiction miniature wargame with steampunk elements published and manufactured by Spartan Games. Launched in October 2010, it is set in an alternate timeline in 1870. In this world, technological advances have occurred over a century before they would in our timeline, which has had dire consequences for the conduct of warfare as technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable.
Dystopian Wars uses a range of resin and pewter models in 1:1200 scale. 
Background.
In 1845, scientist Barnabas Draynes Sturgeon led an expedition to Antarctica searching for a rumoured treasure trove of technology of unknown origin, either alien or from a lost technologically advanced civilisation. His expedition found it in a location called The Vault. Sturgeon wanted to use this technology to bring about an age of peace and bring about a scientific utopia. Instead he was betrayed by an assistant, Markov. Markov fled to Russia where he sold the technology to other nations, such as Tesla directed energy weapons to the Prussian Empire, and helped modernize the Tsar's armies. Sturgeon founded the Covenant of Antarctica to continue his mission of scientific progress, and to end the terrible war that has been unleashed by the new technologies.
Because of Markov's betrayal and the discoveries of the Vault, the nations now go to war with highly advanced vehicles and weapons. Tanks the size of castles, rockets, airships, submarines and robots all march in this new industrial war. Particle beams and lasers are used as offensive weaponry while nuclear fusion is used to propel tanks, airships, planes, naval vessels, rockets and submarines. The Covenant of Antarctica practices both covert operations and military intervention in the affairs of other nations to ensure that no side develops nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, but its technologically advance forces are hard pressed to contain the Great Powers. Gravity Nullification Engines allow ships to skim above the surface, and Time Dilation technology permits the teleportation of units across short distances. Burrowing vehicles vie for control of battlegrounds with massive mobile airfields, whilst in the skies above, flying sky fortresses and warships engage in deadly duels for aerial supremacy.
There are some political developments that also preceded comparative events in our own timeline, or else diverged. The earliest point of divergence is that Republic of Britain industrialised in 1650 under the guidance of Oliver Cromwell, although the monarchy is apparently restored as normal later on, as Queen Victoria rules the Kingdom of Britannia in the Dystopian Wars present. Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, died in 1804, leading to a collapse of the French Empire into civil war. The Prussian Empire was strong enough at this point to launch an aggressive campaign of expansion, analogous to the Napoleonic Wars, that ended in defeat at the hands of the British Army at Waterloo in 1815. Despite this defeat, where the first landships (massive tanks) were used in battle, the Prussian Empire remained strong and forged a united Germany sooner than occurred in our timeline (including Austria). Italy, whilst not unified, is a similarly powerful League dominated by the 'Tetrarchy of Princes': the Doge of the Republic of Venice, and the Kings of the three Kingdoms, Sardinia, Lombardy and Sicily. The League took advantage of the Prussian expansion and the 1804 collapse of Austria to take back many Italian territories from other European powers. Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III in our time line) was elected president of the Republique of France in 1866, not 1848 as in our timeline.
Japan, as the Empire of the Blazing Sun, broke its geographical isolation earlier than was the case in our world and occupied Korea sooner than 1910, suffering a major defeat but learning in the process. The South won the American Civil War in this timeline, a war fought over mineral wealth not slavery (which had been abolished in 1825), and reconfigured the Union as the Federated States of America in 1864. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is not part of the Tsarist Russian Empire analogue, the Russian Coalition. Egypt overthrew French rule in 1804 and Australia is not a British colony, although India and New Zealand are. The Socialist Union of South America formed as a barrier to the expansionist objectives of the FSA and is communist in ideology. The FSA also took over the Caribbean islands and Central America, but not the Philippines, which implies that the Spanish Empire was far weaker than it was in our own timeline. The Chinese Federation and Ottoman Empire are stronger political entities in this timeline than they were in our world due to effective leadership.
Gameplay.
Dystopian Wars is a Victorian sci-fi game that builds upon the core aspects established by the fantasy naval game, Uncharted Seas, and the space combat game, Firestorm Armada. These systems have been advanced to allow for simultaneous combat in all three traditional theatres of war - naval, armoured and aerial.
A game of Dystopian Wars will usually last approximately two hours, but this will depend on how many players are taking part and the amount of models being utilised. Resin and pewter models from the Dystopian Wars range are used to play the game. The rules accommodate small-scale sorties into enemy territory, border skirmishes, and huge, history-defining battles. The rules can also accommodate for large multiplayer game.
The rules include the optional use of a deck of 52 Game Cards designed to improve overall game play by introducing more tactical options and by injecting some eccentric Victorian atmosphere.
Major Nations.
The Great Powers are nations that are currently playable and available to buy for the Dystopian Wars game. They each have a Naval and Armoured Battle Group, and a variety of other units to field.
Kingdom of Britannia.
The world's greatest maritime Empire, the Kingdom of Britannia, has firmly ruled the great oceans since the decisive defeat of the Prussian Empire under Heinrich Otto at the beginning of the 19th Century.
In the process, Britannian colonists and military forces have come into contact with, and gone to war against, numerous opponents. These have ranged from opportunistic French and Prussian expeditions, to other nations such as the Kingdom of Burma and even dissenting imperial subjects such as the Australian rebels.
Through it all, however, the Kingdom has successfully retained the bulk of its holdings, and even steadily expanded them, especially around the coasts of Africa in concert with its small but dependable ally, the Kingdom of Portugal.
Prussian Empire.
Despite its fall from grace under the paranoid and megalomaniacal Emperor Heinrich Otto at the beginning of the century, the Prussian Empire has endured and prospered in the ensuing decades.
Through a combination of economic and military might and pursuit of a shrewd diplomatic strategy, the Prussian Empire has come to dominate Central and Eastern Europe, and even exert considerable influence in the western and southern portions of the continent.
Now under attack from the east and pressured from the west and south, the time has come for the Prussians to throw back their rivals, make their mark upon the world and cement their dominance of Europe for another century. 
Federated States of America.
One of the world's newest great powers, the Federated States of America, has only existed since 1864. Prior to that, North America was dominated by the United States, composed of a combination of old Britannian, French and Spanish territories, and a large portion of what had been Mexico.
However, in the early 1860s, a dispute over the ownership of strategic industrial resources caused a political rift between the United States government and a large number of individual states. This culminated in a bid by the US federal government to use the United States military to enforce this ownership.
Led by Texas and Mississippi, the original targets of the US government's ire thanks to their rich reserves of oil and uranium respectively, the dissenting states seceded from the Union. They formed what was then called the Confederacy.
The two sides went to war in 1860 for dominance over the nation. The Confederacy eventually won out in 1864, thanks to assistance from the Kingdom of Britannia. Nathanial Adams of the New Federalist Party, elected President that year, proclaimed the Federated States of America, and set about the process of turning the nation into a world power.
Empire of the Blazing Sun.
At the cutting edge of industrial and scientific research and development, yet steeped in the traditions of a bygone age, the Empire of the Blazing Sun has risen from nowhere to challenge the dominance of the established powers.
Almost an unknown quantity until recently, the Empire of the Blazing Sun came of age in the 1830s when, after a long and gruelling war, it took possession of the Kingdom of Korea. Among other boons gained after the conquest was the secret of poison gas manufacture.
Now, as the 'Little Giant' of the Pacific seeks to expand its influence, it has for the first time encountered the industrial and commercial agencies of the established powers. As much as the Empress wishes to avoid conflict, it appears that the Empire of the Blazing Sun must employ force as well as words to win their arguments.
Covenant of Antarctica.
The most enigmatic of the world's great powers was, for a few years, celebrated as a great standard-bearer for scientific and technological progress. Its founder, Lord Barnabas D. Sturgeon, discovered the extraordinary Vault, a vast repository of amazing technology. He was to use the materials and scientific wonders contained within the Vault to found his own country at the foot of the world in 1857.
For a few years thereafter, the Covenant was globally feted, with embassies in every nation, and visiting teachers and lecturers at almost all of the great universities and academies. Sturgeon and his circle of advisors shared the bounty of the Vault, but as with all things that begin perfect, corruption and betrayal soon sets in.
The Covenant even purchased South Georgia Island from Britannia, turning it into a city called The Gateway, as a means for foreigners to visit the new nation. But then, in 1866, the Covenant suddenly enclosed its borders, and Sturgeon, without explanation, halted the flow of knowledge.
Almost all of the Antarctican academics left their posts and returned home. Embassies were either reduced to a skeleton staff or simply shut down. Although it is still possible to travel to The Gateway, only genuine migrants seeking citizenship are allowed to travel onwards to Antarctica proper. These people are not seen again - it is widely supposed that the nation's borders are now closed in both directions.
Republique of France.
The resolute Republique of France and its people have undergone many tribulations since their experiences in the early 19th Century. Once it was an imperial power that looked set to challenge the Prussians as masters of Western Europe, and the Britannians as rulers of the oceans. But these dreams were shattered by a series of catastrophic events at the dawn of the century.
Such was the speed of its fall from grace that France, which in 1804 had dictated the fate of other nations, had by 1815 been virtually reduced to the role of spectator to events. The future of Europe and a considerable part of the world besides was decided on the fields of Waterloo, but the Republique's fate was out of its hands entirely.
However, since that time, the Republique had not languished in despair. Having reached, as they saw it, the very lowest depths of hopelessness, the French spent the following decades dedicating all their efforts and energies into rebuilding their nation and its glory.
Now, as the 1870s dawn, and the world is gripped by crisis, France sees at last the chance to regain its rightful place as a great power. The self-satisfied, the naysayers and the complacent, at home and abroad, who in the past have sought to write off the Republique's fortunes will soon be proven very wrong.
Russian Coalition.
The vast expanse of the Russian Coalition dominates more than one sixth of the world's entire landmass. What is all the more remarkable is that, with the exception of the distant and rugged Oblast of Alaska, across the Bering Sea, all of this vast empire is one contiguous realm. It is the product of several centuries of military conquest and political and royal union.
The Russian Coalition has existed as a single political union since the crowning of Ivan IV - known as Ivan Grozny: 'the Terrible' or 'the Fearsome' - as the first true Tsar of all Russia in the 16th Century. Known as the Russian Empire before 1800, it has steadily expanded its borders, most notably under the guiding hand of Romanov Tsar Peter the Great.
Peter in particular was determined to make his empire strong through modern means. He toured Europe during his reign, determined to furnish his empire with the many technological wonders of the new industrial age, especially those he saw in Britain - steam power, early iron-plated boats and mechanised factories.
However, Romanov rule is now but a distant memory. Tsar Vladimir I Nikolaevich of the House of Rurik-Novy - New Rurik - rules now. The means by which his family achieved imperial power, and their exercise of it, has defined the modern Russian Coalition.
Alliance Nations.
The Alliance Nations are secondary powers established in the Dystopian Wars timeline. Players can field a variety of these units as accompanying forces to the Great Powers. The following Alliance Nations have already seen some of their units released.
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Sandwiched between the Prussian Empire and the Russian Coalition, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has always stood in a precarious position in the volatile political intrigues and territorial disputes of central and Eastern Europe. The Commonwealth is not inconsiderable in size – its lands stretch from the Baltic to the Black Sea coasts, with Riga its northernmost city and Odessa the southernmost. Formed from a union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Commonwealth has a unique system of governance; the elective monarchy. The ruling King of the Commonwealth is elected by a parliamentary body known as the Sejm, which holds the real political power in the nation – in the past several kings have been dismissed from office by the Sejm which felt that their rule was proceeding counter to the best interests of the Commonwealth.
Dominion of Canada.
The Dominion of Canada has long been one of Britannia's most important imperial possessions. The Canadians have a reputation for making tough and hardy soldiers, who adapt well to battlefields around the world.
Canadian designers have benefitted from contact with American scientists and engineers, thanks to Britannia's long-standing cordial relationship with the Federated States of America. They have also been able to adopt a few aspects of French engineering from sympathetic expatriates based in Quebec.
Kingdom of Denmark.
Alone amongst the other Scandinavian nations, the Danes have preserved their independence despite being almost wholly surrounded by the Prussian Empire and within easy striking distance of both the Russian Coalition and the Kingdom of Britannia.
The Danes bargained their Norwegian lands to Heinrich Otto in 1810 in order to keep their homeland free. Since then, as allies of the Prussians they have prospered and Erik VIII, King of the Danes since 1852 has reinforced this situation.
Protectorate of Belgium.
A key ally of the Republique of France since the grim year of 1816, the Protectorate of Belgium has historically been a region of great strategic importance to the three Great Powers. None are more aware of this than the Belgians themselves, and the nation is studded with fortifications built up over scores of years in an attempt to limit the damage caused by frequent wars.
Unfortunately, a bitter civil war between supporters of Belgium's current ruler, Protector Jean-Paul Vermeirens and the Coronet, a rebel faction led by Godeleva, self-styled 'Queen of the Belgians' has torn the nation apart. Although Vermeirens retains control of most of the country, East and West Flanders declared for the Royalists, along with most of Belgium's navy.
Vermierens asked for aid from the French and eventually the Prussians, despite lingering Belgian distrust of the latter. Meanwhile, the Royalists have sought help from the Kingdom of Britannia and its allies and the wider war has now engulfed Belgium.
The Belgian military forces are strongest on land, deploying heavily armoured home-designed Land Ships and Medium Tanks with a strong emphasis on defence. The Protectorate traditioinally employs French-built equipment, but the Royalists have gained arms from the Kingdom of Britannia to bolster their forces. 
Prussian Scandinavia.
Prussian Scandinavia is a Dominion of the Prussian Empire and home of the powerful Teutonic Order, closely linked with the Prussian Imperial family for generations.
Any Teutonic Order fleet has access to all of the equipment available to their Prussian brothers and far to the north in Prussian Scandinavia, the forces of the Teutonic Order are mobilising their full armed strength in their old domains, with huge war engines and elite soldiers massing to take their place in the Prussian Empire front lines.
Other Alliance Nations.
There are also a variety of other Alliance Nations in the Dystopian Wars universe. The following Alliance Nations are yet to be released: United Kingdom of Romania, Free Hellenic Kingdom, Belgian Royalist Rebels, Alliance Preference: Grand Coalition, Portuguese Empire, League of Italian States, Ottoman Dominions, Egyptian Republic, Spanish Republican Confederacy (SRC), Socialist Union of South America (SUSA), Free Republic of Chile, Chinese Federation, Commonwealth of Free Australia.
Reception.
Dystopian Wars has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The game currently holds an average rating of 7.78/10 with BoardGameGeek, based on 125 ratings. Peter Ray Allison of OneMetal describes the game as "an excellent miniatures game that has many gamers claiming Dystopian Wars as the game that got them back into gaming." Allison also describes the rules system as "refreshing", referring to its accommodation of land, sea or air engagements.
Phil Spurgeon of The Shell Case describes Dystopian Wars as "an excellent game with great ambition and superb models." Spurgeon praises the quality of the background material and the rules, but feels that the rulebook could be read better and is in need of improvement.
Raef Granger and Russ Wakelin of the D6 Generation gave Dystopian Wars a 2++ rating (97%), describing the game as very cinematic and praising the look of the models. Raef picks out the Prussian Empire Imperium Class Sky Fortress as the most iconic model in Dystopian Wars. Craig Gallant of the D6 Generation gave Dystopian Wars a 3++ rating (89%), praising the games cinematics but criticising some of the editing in the rulebook. Overall, the D6 Generation team felt that Dystopian Wars mixes exciting elements of naval gameplay, steampunk and alternative reality to offer a unique gaming experience.

<doc id="30928097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30928097" title="Kentucky Army National Guard">
Kentucky Army National Guard

The Kentucky Army National Guard is a component of the United States Army and the United States National Guard. Nationwide, the Army National Guard comprises approximately one half of the US Army's available combat forces and approximately one third of its support organization. National coordination of various state National Guard units are maintained through the National Guard Bureau.
Kentucky Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army. The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Kentucky Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Kentucky.
The Kentucky Army National Guard is composed of approximately 61 armories and is present in 53 communities, the headquarters is located in Frankfort, KY
Duties.
National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by presidential order to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state in which they serve. Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary DutY Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units.
Active Duty Callups.
For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served "One weekend a month, two weeks a year", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six year enlistment period (this policy is due to change 1 August 2007, the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months, individual states have differing policies).
History.
The Kentucky State Guard became the Kentucky National Guard in 1912, when a new federal law regulating the militia came into effect. The new system set training standards for state units and established more efficient procedures for mobilizing the Guard into federal service.
The procedures were tested in 1916 when violence from the revolution going on in Mexico spilled across the border. Nearly all the Kentucky National Guard joined units from many other states on patrol along the Mexican border. For the first time, Kentucky troops used trucks and machine guns on active duty. Guardsmen returned from Texas in 1917 just in time to be mustered into federal service for duty in World War I.
The 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery Regiment of the Kentucky Army National Guard was ordered to service in Vietnam in late 1968. The unit supported the regular 101st Airborne Division. The Battalion's C Battery lost nine men killed and 32 wounded when North Vietnamese troops overran Fire Base Tomahawk on June 19, 1969.
Soldiers of the Kentucky Army National Guard's 133rd Mobile Public Affairs Detachment deployed to Bosnia for NATO's Operation Joint Forge. The unit provided Public Affairs support to the commander of Task Force Eagle and Multi-National Division.
The 149th Armored Brigade traces its recent history to the activation of XXIII Corps Artillery on 1 October 1959. It was then converted and redesignated HHC 149th Armored Brigade on 1 November 1980. A military unit has been active in the Louisville area since the 149th Infantry Regiment Combat Team was activated after World War II. The U.S. Army Center for Military History attributes lineage and honors to the Louisville unit further back than that. In 1984-85, the brigade included the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 123rd Armored Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery. It served a period of being an infantry brigade, circa 2006, including a deployment to Iraq, where it assumed responsibility for COB Speicher, Tikrit, on 1 June 2006. The brigade now appears to be the 149th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, whose activation took place in the Kentucky 2006-2007 fiscal year (July 2006-end of June 2007). Its badge was redesignated as the 149th MEB badge effective 1 September 2008.
Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear was quoted as saying that the January 2009 storm that blew through Kentucky was the “worst natural disaster” to ever hit the commonwealth. Nearly all of the 120 counties were affected in some way, and almost every Kentucky Guardsman was called up to assist citizens from the Bluegrass to the Mississippi River. More than 4,600 National Guard soldiers and airmen in Kentucky were called up for duty.

Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations

The Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations (also known as the Donovan Commission) was an inquiry into the system of collective UK labour law, chaired by Lord Donovan and heavily influenced by the opinions of Hugh Clegg. Its report, known as the "Donovan Report", was issued in 1968 (Cmnd 3623).
Overview.
The Commission originally was inclined to recommend legal constraints on unions, (as presaged by Barbara Castle's White Paper, "In Place of Strife"), in order to back up governmental prices and incomes policy. However Clegg, by threatening to issue a minority report, persuaded it instead to back improved collective bargaining. 
The recommendations of the Commission on dismissal procedures were embodied in the Industrial Relations Act 1971. Exclusive jurisdiction to hear complaints and give remedies was conferred upon the newly created National Industrial Relations Court. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 soon replaced the unfair dismissal provisions, as was the National Industrial Relations Court with a system of Industrial Tribunals, since renamed Employment Tribunals. These have one legally qualified chairperson and two lay members, one representing unions and the other representing employers.
The present law on unfair dismissal is found in the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Kaya F.C.

Kaya Futbol Club is a Filipino association football club based in the NCR. They are currently playing in the first division of the United Football League.
The name of the club comes from the Filipino word "káya", which means "we can". In Old Tagalog, the word is closely defined as "susi ng kapatiran" (key to brotherhood). Both of these definitions provide the basis for Kaya FC's team spirit and vision as a club. The club is owned by Santiago Araneta, the CEO and the owner of LBC Express.
History.
In the late 1980s, one evening a week, players of all ages and from different backgrounds would get together on a basketball court for indoor football. The enjoyment of the weekly practices grew and the players' skill improved rapidly. They began to join outdoor 7-a-side football tournaments playing against different teams. Frequently the Kaya team members found themselves on the winner’s podium receiving medals and trophies.
After a few years and multiple awards, they realized that many of their teammates were some of the best in the country and the team needed to set a foundation. The name Kaya Football Club was then created in July 1996 and the beginning of the Kaya leadership on and off the field for football in the NCR and the Philippines became more prominent.
In the late 1990s Kaya FC participated in official and more challenging 11-a-side football tournaments organized by the National Capital Region Football Association. The team was eventually recognized as one of the only club teams capable of defeating the "big three", composed of the Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force and Philippine Navy football clubs.
Between 2000 and 2009 Kaya FC defeated the armed forces teams in two separate championships and was the Champion of the United Football League (UFL) on three occasions (2009 the UFL became the LBC-UFL and invited the armed forces to join the league wherein Kaya FC placed 2nd).
In the last few years a number of Kaya FC players represented the Philippines in international tournaments.
Image and Fanbase.
The colors of Kaya's badge, red, green, yellow and black, are mainly based on the pan-African colors that are associated with rastafarianism. This is mainly due to the heavy influence of Reggae on the club's founding members lives. Even the clubs name, aside from its original Filipino meaning, are also derived from a famous Filipino reggae song from the pinoy band, Pinikpikan. As a result of this strong influence on the clubs members, the club itself is mainly associated with this movement.
In addition to this, Kaya boasts of having the most fans in the UFL, and fangroups such as the famous Ultras Kaya, are known for their loud and fierce support of the club. Kaya has had rivalries with many teams in the UFL, the most prominent ones today being with fellow NCR-based Loyola Meralco Sparks F.C. and with Global F.C., since these three mostly fight for the title. These three clubs are also amongst the most supported and successful in the UFL today making every clash between the three very intense. In the 2010s they also had a fierce rivalry with Union Internacional Manila F.C. but since the club dissolved and decided to be relegated to Division 2, this rivalry has mostly died out.
Viewed as the pioneers in ultras culture in the Philippines, the Ultras Kaya also inspired the creation of other ultra goups such as the PAF ultras, the supporters of Philippine Air Force F.C., with whom the Kaya ultras share a close friendship.

James Davidson (rugby union)

James Davidson was an English Rugby Union Football international who came from Aspatria, in Cumberland, Davidson was a stonemason and a builder by trade.
Sports career.
James Davidson, more affectionately known as Jim, was born at Aspatria on 28 December 1868. He received his education at the Aspatria Agricultural College, where he excelled at sport, winning representative honours at both Association Football and Rugby Union. For over fifteen years Davidson was a prominent member of Aspatria RUFC, playing as a forward in the old scrimmaging style. He played for Aspatria when they won the Cumberland County Rugby Union Cup in 1891, ’92, ’96 and ’99. He won forty-four Cumberland County caps; made a record number of eight appearances for the North in their annual games against the South; played several times for the Rest of England in their annual game against the County Champions, and although selected to represent England on seven occasions, would, through ill-health and injury, play in only five. In 1897, he played for England in the game against Scotland; in 1898, against Scotland and Wales; and in 1899 against Scotland and Ireland. In the Calcutta Cup match in 1898, he was, according to one journalist, the ‘man of the match’. “When the whistle blew no man came off the field on either side fresher or more ready to renew hostilities than James Davidson.” 
Upon retirement from the game Jim became a respected official. He was chairman of the County Selectors Committee, and the Cumberland representative to the Rugby Union. He was also one of the principal administrators in the Aspatria Club and held numerous offices. He was a stonemason and builder by trade, a man with a giant frame, noted for his great strength, sporting attitude and determination. Described in the sporting journal, Sporting Life, as ‘Hard as Nails’. In 1898 he became the first recipient of a sporting testimonial in Cumberland. He died at Aspatria on 23 December 1943.

Weld pool

Weld pool commonly refers to the dime-sized workable portion of a weld where the base metal has reached its melting point and is ready to be infused with filler material. The weld pool is central to the success of the welding process. It was first observed in oxy-fuel welding by Fouché & Picard in 1903, after the discovery of acetylene by Edmund Davy in 1836. 
The weld pool must be carried along the joint in a consistent width and depth, and the motion used to carry the weld pool has a direct effect on the quality of the weld bead. A weld made by starting and carrying a weld pool, without the addition of a filler material, is called an autogenous weld.

Rudolph Stauffer

First Sergeant Rudolph Stauffer (November 27, 1836 – June 9, 1918) was an American soldier in the U.S. Army who served with the 5th U.S. Cavalry in the Apache Wars. He was one of twelve soldiers, along with ten Apache Scouts, awarded the Medal of Honor during Lieutenant Colonel George Crook's "winter campaign" of 1872-73, being cited for gallantry in battle against renegade Apaches near Camp Hualpai. Charles King, while serving with the 5th U.S. Cavalry in his youth, wrote of him in his memoirs as "grim old Stauffer, the first sergeant".
Biography.
Rudolph Stauffer was born in Bern, Switzerland, on November 27, 1836. He later emigrated to the United States and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio.
On June 24, 1855, he enlisted in the United States Army and was eventually assigned to Company K of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment (which later became 5th U.S. Cavalry Regiment). By the early 1870s, a "typical hard-bitten noncommissioned officer of the old cavalry", he had risen to the rank of first sergeant.
Stauffer was posted at Camp Hualpai in the Arizona Territory during the Apache Wars. On May 19, 1872, he led a small cavalry force, along with Ed Clark and Dan O'Leary, after an Apache raiding party which had stolen cattle from a ranch in Williamson Valley. Stauffer and the cavalry troopers pursued the raiders eastward over a distance of 110 miles when, according to Lieutenant Colonel George Crook, a "terrible fight occurred". Two soldiers were wounded, four renegades were killed, and one head of cattle was recovered. A month later, he was involved in another engagement with the Apaches when, on June 30, he and several other soldiers held off the hostile Indians from a butte near Camp Verde; the location was later named "Stauffer's Butte" in his honor. Stauffer was also presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor for his leadership during the battle.
In November of that year, Stauffer was part of Lieutenant Colonel George Crook's so-called "winter campaign" against renegades still active after the surrender of Cochise in late-1872. He was one of 12 cavalrymen, along with 10 Apache scouts, who guided Crook's columns in the mountainous area of the Tonto Basin where Western Apache and Yavapai bands used as a base for raiding parties and had successfully eluded the U.S. Army for a number of years. Stauffer was among the scouts cited for "gallant conduct during the campaigns and engagements with Apaches", many of whom would also be awarded the Medal of Honor, which he received on July 30, 1875.
After leaving the army on December 11, 1878, Stauffer retired to the Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C. where he lived until his death on June 9, 1918, at the age of 81. A lifelong bachelor, he has no known descendants. He is one of 22 Medal of Honor recipients, along with three other veterans of the Apache Wars, interred at the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery.

Douglas Walatara

Dr Douglas Walatara (23 October 1920 - 2 February 2011) was a notable Sri Lankan Lecturer in English. He initially taught at the Sri Lankan Government Training College in Maharagama for over 20 years. Following this, he was a Professor of Education at the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka.
Dr Walatara became well known for the "Reconstruction Method" which was a bilingual method that used the student's mother tongue to teach the English language. Some have claimed that this was designed mainly for the benefit of rural children who had difficulty learning English under teachers who themselves “learnt English as a foreign language and for whom English was entirely foreign”.
Early years.
Douglas Walatara was the eldest of three brothers born to an Anglo-Indian mother from Goa, India, and a Sinhalese father from Colombo, Sri Lanka. He attended S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia where he excelled in English studies. In the very early 1960s, Walatara lived in England for a year before returning to Sri Lanka.
English Profession.
A popular Sri Lankan Newspaper, the Sunday Times, describes Dr Walatara as having performed with much distinction, the task of educating teachers in the South Asian country. In fact, Dr Walatara led a group of educationists who wanted to teach English through the Sinhala language. This group of educationists included Jeanne Hoban (also known as Jeanne Moonesinghe) among others.
It was claimed that he renounced a prestigious position as an executive in the Bank of Ceylon to take up a role as a lower paid but more fulfilling, job as a teacher-educator.
Dr Walatara had a number of well known published materials. Some of his works have received coverage outside Sri Lanka. For example, some of his books are available through national libraries across the globe, such as the Australian National Library.

Emelia Gorecka

Emelia Jane Gorecka (born 29 January 1994), is a British middle and long-distance runner. She now runs for Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club and lives in Bookham, Surrey. She specialises in middle and long-distance running, racing in 1500 metres, 3000 metres, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres, as well as cross country running. Górecka is the current European Junior 3000m champion and is coached by Mick Woods.
After winning a number of youth titles at the national level, Górecka had her first international success at the 2010 European Cross Country Championships, where she won a bronze medal in the Junior race. She was also the best European Junior at the World Cross Country Championships that year. In the 2011 European Cross Country Championships she won the junior women's race and led Britain to victory in the team event.
At the age of 14 she topped the UK rankings chart in the 1500m for the U15 age group, in what was the third fastest ever time for someone her age. By the time she was 16 years old she had won a total of 20 national and seven international races and taken part in three World Championship events.
Górecka holds the British record time for the mile race as an U15 Girl, 4:46.87, which beat the previous record by four seconds. She also holds the record for 3000m in the U15/U17 age groups.
On 8 December 2013, Górecka came 1st at the European Cross Country Championships in Belgrade, Serbia with a comfortable win over Polish athlete, Sofia Ennaoui with a time of 13:06. The race was on BBC 2 and was televised in 11 other countries.
Emelia Górecka came a close 3rd in her senior debut at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country on 11 January 2014, helping team GB & NI win the International team challenge. The three-time European junior cross-country champion followed Great Britain women’s captain Gemma Steel for much of the race, before slipping to third place on the final lap. In her interview, Emelia said "There was definitely no fear... I didn’t really know what to expect; I knew I was in good shape but I just wanted to be taken around course by the girls. I didn’t expect to get in the front but I felt good... the last lap was a bit of a struggle but my strength will hopefully come on in the next couple of years. It’s good platform to build on, coming third, so I’m really happy." And Górecka also said she wants one last victory as a junior before concentrating on moving up to the adult ranks: “I’m still a junior for the national cross-country, so I’d love to go there to get my eighth consecutive win... then I will go on to do some senior races, maybe some indoors, and then onto the track, but hopefully I will keep going quicker.”
Scoliosis.
Despite being fortunate enough to have experienced a lot of success in her early years as an athlete, the road had not always been smooth. It was during her first year with Aldershot, Farnham & District AC that she was diagnosed with Scoliosis – a medical condition which means that she had a fairly spectacular curvature of the spine. It came with a delightful rotation, which meant that some of her basic movements were rather tricky to negotiate; swinging her arms freely, for example.
In Emelia's case, the Scoliosis is a genetic condition and is not related to running at all. Emelia said "This diagnosis initially meant nothing to me – it was unnoticeable and it didn't seem to affect me in the slightest".
However in 2008 she discovered that her condition had declined and that she was now the owner of two curves of 27 and 34 degrees, displayed as a rather distorted 'S' shape on the x-ray. Górecka consultant told her that she would have to wear a body brace to support her back as she completed her adolescent growth spurt. Emelia was also told that she might not be able to spend enough time out of the brace each week to continue training. Emelia said "This was the first time in my life where I was struck silent. In that split second I decided I would never let anyone tell me that there was anything that was out of my reach". Her mum helped her to wipe away the tears, she talked the consultant through the weekly training regime, that she was committed to at that time, and he agreed that Emelia could come out of the brace for a total of 10 hours each week to train and to race. Her attitude changed quickly to one of, 'the sooner the brace is on, the sooner it will be off…'.

James Stow

James Stow (born. c. 1770, died in or after 1823), was an English engraver.
Life.
Born near Maidstone about 1770, the son of a labourer. At the age of thirteen he is said to have engraved a plate from Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's "St. John and the Lamb," which showed such precocious talent that a group of local gentry provided funds for him to move to London and study for William Woollett, one of the leading engravers of the time. After Woollett's death in 1785, he completed his apprenticeship with William Sharp.
Stow is said to have fallen into dissipated habits; he died in obscurity and poverty.
Works.
Stow worked entirely as a line engraver. He engraved many of the plates for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery, after paintings by British artists. He also produced engravings as illustrations for other publications, among them Robert Bowyer's edition of David Hume's "History of England"(1806), Thomas Macklin's "Illustrated Bible" (1791–1800), F. J. du Roveray's edition of Alexander Pope's translation of "The Odyssey of Homer", and George Perfect Harding's series of portraits of the deans of Westminster (1822), as well as other publications.
Stow's most important single plates were "The Three Women at the Sepulchre," after Benjamin West, which he issued himself; and a portrait of Lord Frederick Campbell, after Henry Edridge. His latest employment was upon the illustrations to Robert Wilkinson's "Londina Illustrata," (1811–23).

Tongan nobles

There are 33 traditional noble titles in the modern Kingdom of Tonga. They all are estate holders. 20 titles were established by Siaosi Tupou I with the Constitution of 1875. In 1880 he added 10 more. Tupou II created the titles Lasike in 1894 and Veikune in 1903. Sālote Tupou III made in 1921 the title of Tupoutoʻa. In the beginning it was forbidden for a noble to have more than one title. Later this was made possible.
Some of the great chiefs who missed out on a noble's title (in 1910) were among others: ʻAlipate Mafileʻo of Kolomotuʻa, SA Sipu of Kolomotuʻa, Iki Lolohea of Haʻapai (but later inherited the Fulivai), Tēvita Tapueluelu of Vavaʻu, SF Tafolo, Tēvita Ula Afuhaʻamango of Vavaʻu, Siosiua Niutupuʻivaha Kaho (but later inherited the Tuʻivakanō).
These unacknowledged chiefs were still lords in the traditional sense. However their influence slowly decreased with each passing generation. Queen Sālote acknowledged this in some of her public speeches by paying respect to the chiefs then a separate respect to the Nobles of the Crown as: «Highly respectful for the Chiefs is also Highly respectful for the nobles in this land».
In the 21st century King George Tupou V created eight new noble titles but with no hereditary lands. This title is to remain with them for their whole life known and is considered equivalent to the United Kingdom's practice of appointing Life Peers.

Miliary fever

Miliary fever was a medical term in the past (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's death report showed this term), used to indicate a general cause of infectious disease that cause an acute fever and skin rashes similar to the cereal grain called proso millet.<br>
After subsequent advances in medicine, this term fell into disuse, supplanted by other more specific names of diseases, for example the modern miliary tuberculosis.

Isha Home School

Isha Home School (or IHS, as it also known) is a residential school situated at the Isha Yoga Center near Coimbatore and founded in 2005 by Sadhguru. Children are divided amongst the four houses, Chola, Hoysala, Kakatiya and Maratha named after ancient empires of the Deccan Plateau in India.
Residential arrangement.
Depending on their age, students at the Isha Home School fall into one of three sections - junior school, middle school and senior school. Junior and middle school students up to grade 8, reside in a home-like atmosphere with the children living in "houses" with "house parents" and housemates of various ages. The houses are designed to recreate the atmosphere of the home with classes being conducted mainly within the premises of the house itself. The senior school students reside in dormitory-style boarding. 
Teaching methods.
At the junior and middle school levels, the school implements a synthesis of the Montessori method of teaching and a more typical teacher-student method of education. Children are encouraged to experiment and explore various subjects and develop an interest in them with teachers and house parents playing the roles of guides and mentors. The senior school from grade 9 onwards, follows a more typical classroom teaching method. At the senior school level, the school follows the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) board of education at grade 10 and the Indian School Certificate (ISC) at grade 12. Emphasis is placed on learning outside the textbook. Innovative methods of education such as teaching mathematics using origami are combined with field trips to facilitate learning. Frequent workshops are also conducted on performance arts such as pottery and dramatics with experts from various fields such as Shobha Viswanath, Creative Director of Karadi Tales, Velu Saravanan, Prahlad Kakkar and Shekhar Kapur sharing their expertise with the students.

Aleksandar Srnec

Aleksandar Srnec (30 July 1924 – 27 March 2010) was a Croatian artist. He is mainly known for his avant-garde designs and kinetic and lumino kinetic art.
Srnec was one of the founding members of the Exat 51 group whose active members between 1950 and 1956 were the architects Vjenceslav Richter, Bernardo Bernardi, Zdravko Bregovac, Božidar Rašica and Vladimir Zaharović and the painters Vlado Kristl and Ivan Picelj. He made abstract art based on the use of geometric shapes. In 1953, he designed his first kinetic objects entitled, "Space Modulator", while in 1956, he began his experiments with moving sculptures and reliefs. 
In the 1960s, Srnec participated in the "New Tendencies" exhibitions. From 1962, he became involved with luminal-kinetic experiments, for example "Luminoplastic I", and from 1968, he began making "ambience art". His work entitled "Luminoplastic Ambience", exhibited in 1967, in Gallery SC, (Student Centre Gallery) in Zagreb, was the first luminal-kinetic object/ambience in Croatian art. He collaborated with the Zagreb School of Animated Films and made sets for three puppet films. He also made the animated film "A Man and His Shadow" together with Dragutin Vunak. 
In the period from 1974 to 1977, he returned to making kinetic sculptures in highly polished metals. He also began experimenting with light. He exhibited at many shows in Croatia and abroad: Zagreb (1953, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1978, 1979, 1983, 1992), Belgrade (1953, 1956, 1968, 1971), Banja Luka (1972), Paris (1959), London (1960, 1961) and Mannheim (1971). His retrospective exhibition "Present Absence" was held in two cities: at the Gallery of Old and Contemporary Masters and at Varteks facilities in Varaždin, (2008) and at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, (2010). He received many awards, including the Vladimir Nazor Award for life achievement (1999) and the Croatian Association of Artists Life Achievement Award (2008).

Shima (film)

Shima is a 2007 film from Uzbekistan.
Plot.
At the end of the Second World War, imperial Japanese fanaticism seals the fate of an island's inhabitants and its garrison, through a massacre, interrupting the love between a soldier and a fisherman's daughter. The daughter survives, but the other survivor Taro- a soldier cut off from all communication- continues to serve the emperor for another thirty years. Tormented in his dreams by memories and his secret aspiration for eternal peace.
Taro is regularly 'inspected' by his former military inspector Yamada, who exploits the situation to entertain former Japanese officers, nostalgic of Imperial Japan, by luring visitors to the island through his War Veterans Association. The visitors are held captive and enrolled by Taro to serve in the army of the Great Emperor. For the sadistic pleasure of the former Japanese officers, Yamada organises "inspections" during which the new recruits must prove their devotion to the emperor by sacrificing their lives.
Many years later Shintaro, the son of the fisherman's daughter, finds himself on the island after searching for his father. He learns his father disappeared on the island just before the massacre. He contacts Yamada through the War Veterans Association, who agrees to take him and others to the island. But once they arrive he abandons them and puts Taro in charge. For Shintaro and his comrades this means forced enrolment, military drills and suffering. After months of torture Shintaro and the other captives start to accept Taro's twisted sense of reality. The training intensifies as Taro prepares the recruits to fight a mysterious enemy.
Influences.
Based on the true story of Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese holdout who did not surrender until 1974. During his service, it has been estimated that he killed about thirty people, including American soldiers and local police militia.

Agency 114

Agency 114, Germ. Politischen Informationen (Nr. 114) was a Cold War–era clandestine front of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) used for domestic counter-intelligence purposes which served as a main entrance for former Nazis.
Origin.
Agency 114 was established within the Gehlen Organization following the end of World War II. The United States Army, seeking intelligence on Soviet agents' activities within the American-occupied zone, brought the assignment to Reinhard Gehlen who proceeded to initiate the operation.
Cold War.
At the height of the Cold War in the 1960s, the agency had been merged into the BND, the successor of the Gehlen Org. It was located in Karlsruhe and the Zimmerle & Co. served as the front, specializing in roller blinds. Aside from Soviet counter-intelligence activities, the agency also began monitoring domestic leftists and pacifists. 
By this time it was headed by Alfred Benzinger, a former sergeant of the secret Nazi military police Geheime Feldpolizei. Among the former Nazis who worked in the agency were Konrad Fiebig and .
Operations to whitewash German responsibility for World War II.
In 1956 Alfred Benzinger proposed a coordinated action to propagate a deceitful term "Polish Concentration Camps". It would suggest, contrarily to the facts, that Poles, not Germans, were responsible for the mass genocide during World War II.

Susanne Kessler

Susanne Kessler (1955 in Wuppertal) is a German – Italian painter, illustrator and installation artist.
Life.
From 1975–1982 Susanne Kessler studied painting and graphic at the Berlin University of the Arts and the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London. In 1992 she won the Paul Strecker Award of the City of Mainz. 
In addition to scholarships and artist residencies more than 50 solo exhibitions and numerous group exhibitions have taken her throughout Europe and to India, Pakistan, Mali Ethiopia, Guatemala, Iran, Latvia and the USA (Turlock, CA, Washington, DC, New York, NY, Charlottesville, VA). 
2001/2002 she has served as a guest professor at the California State University – Stanislaus, USA, followed to the Latvian Academy of Arts in Riga, Latvia in 2010 and to the City University of New York, NY, USA in 2011. Susanne Kessler lives in Berlin/Germany and Rome/Italy.
Work.
Susanne Kessler creates expansive, organic-like installations. Primarily based on drawing, she has been concentrating on natural, living structures for many years. Some of her work is dedicated to imagery of the internal organs like the human brain, with its visual appearance and its inner complex structure. According to Kessler, only the limitation to the brain, with individual thinking and visualizing, promotes an "ego-construction", which moves away from science and into an artistic world. 
Thought fragments and trains of thoughts that deal continually with biological models are often integrated by Kessler into a system of drawings, forming a complex net of overlapping patterns and poetic content. In the center of her work the Wheel of Life, the principle of life, is made visible as a flow of vital energy, as an ever-changing process reflecting at the same time the work process of the artist. Series of drawings are constantly involved in new installations in order to renew from within. This results include spaces of graphic signs and symbols, integrating some of the kinetic energy of the location.
These biological models have revealed themselves, for example, in organic forms cut out of Tyvek paper.

Multilinear principal component analysis

Multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) is a mathematical procedure that uses multiple orthogonal transformations to convert a set of multidimensional objects into another set of multidimensional objects of lower dimensions. There is one orthogonal (linear) transformation for each dimension (mode): hence "multilinear". This transformation aims to capture as high a variance as possible, accounting for as much of the variability in the data as possible, subject to the constraint of mode-wise orthogonality. 
MPCA is a multilinear extension of principal component analysis (PCA). The major difference is that PCA needs to reshape a multidimensional object into a vector, while MPCA operates directly on multidimensional objects through mode-wise processing. E.g., for 100x100 images, PCA operates on vectors of 10000x1 while MPCA operates on vectors of 100x1 in two modes. For the same amount of dimension reduction, PCA needs to estimate 49 (10000/(100x2)-1) times more parameters than MPCA in this example. Thus, MPCA is more efficient and better conditioned in practice.
MPCA is a basic algorithm for dimension reduction via multilinear subspace learning. In wider scope, it belongs to tensor-based computation. Its origin can be traced back to the Tucker decomposition in 1960s and it is closely related to higher-order singular value decomposition, (HOSVD) and to the best rank-(R1, R2, ..., RN ) approximation of higher-order tensors.
The algorithm.
MPCA performs feature extraction by determining a multilinear projection that captures most of the original tensorial input variations. As in PCA, MPCA works on centered data. The MPCA solution follows the alternating least square (ALS) approach. Thus, is iterative in nature and it proceeds by decomposing the original problem to a series of multiple projection subproblems. Each subproblem is a classical PCA problem, which can be easily solved.
It should be noted that while PCA with orthogonal transformations produces uncorrelated features/variables, this is not the case for MPCA. Due to the nature of tensor-to-tensor transformation, MPCA features are not uncorrelated in general although the transformation in each mode is orthogonal. In contrast, the uncorrelated MPCA (UMPCA) generates uncorrelated multilinear features.
Feature selection.
MPCA produces tensorial features. For conventional usage, vectorial features are often preferred. E.g. most classifiers in the literature takes vectors as input. On the other hand, as there are correlations among MPCA features, a further selection process often improve the performance. Supervised (discriminative) MPCA feature selection is used in for object recognition while unsupervised MPCA feature selection is employed in visualization task.
Extensions.
Various extensions of MPCA have been developed:

Project Nanhi Kali is an Indian non-governmental organisation that supports education for underprivileged girls in India. Founded by Anand Mahindra in 1996, it is jointly managed by the Naandi Foundation and the KC Mahindra Education Trust, which is part of the corporate social responsibility activities of the Mahindra Group. Currently, Project Nanhi Kali supports over 57,000 students.
Project Nanhi Kali sees educating girls and women as a way to positively impact India in the long run. Sheetal Mehta, the president of the non-profit organisation, told the "Daily News and Analysis" in an interview that "we wanted to create global awareness about the plight of young girls in the country who are denied their basic right."
Students who are selected for Nanhi Kali receive both financial and academic support. They attend special classes to learn math, science, and language concepts. Nanhi Kali pays for the hidden costs of their education, including pencils, notebooks, uniforms, school bags, clothes, and shoes. Funding is from individual and corporate donors, who sponsor a particular child and receive regular updates on her progress at school. Sponsors can also go to the online "Girl Store" to purchase particular items for a student. The Mahindra Group sponsors the education of 11,000 girl children through Project Nanhi Kali. 
Third-party assessments show that Nanhi Kali has a significant impact on the girls' lives. Over a one year period, Nanhi Kali students' improvement in learning outcomes ranged from 40 percent in tribal Chhattisgarh to 78 percent in Mumbai.

ClariS

History.
2009–2012: Formation and junior high school.
ClariS formed in late 2009 as "Alice Clara" when, as first-year junior high school students, Clara and Alice submitted a cover of the Vocaloid song "Step to You" onto the Niconico video sharing website on October 10, 2009. ClariS released seven more covers in 2009. On April 24, 2010, the publisher Sony Magazines under Sony Music Entertainment Japan launched the anime music magazine "LisAni!" with an attached CD containing the original song "Drop" composed by Kz of Livetune and sung by ClariS. ClariS released five more covers in 2010, ending with the song "Listen!!" from the anime "K-On!!" as their 13th cover submitted on June 5, 2010. On July 24, 2010, the second issue of "LisAni!" was released with another attached CD containing the original song , again composed by Kz and sung by ClariS. A single containing both songs was released exclusively at Comiket 78 on August 13, 2010.
Much focus was put on Clara and Alice being in junior high school at the time. From early on when they uploaded their covers onto Niconico, there was some disbelief whether the girls were actually in junior high school and there were numerous comments on their adult-sounding voices. Despite this, Clara and Alice were described as simply normal junior high school girls, and while Kz felt much of their appeal came from them being in junior high school, he also felt their future potential played a part in it.
By September 2010, ClariS was signed to SME Records, much to the surprise of Clara and Alice. Alice would later remark that she had suspicions about it, and wondered if they were somehow being tricked. ClariS released their major debut single "Irony" on October 20, 2010. Composed by Kz, "Irony" debuted at No. 7 on Oricon's weekly singles chart, and was used as the opening theme of the 2010 anime TV series "Oreimo". Good Smile Company released a Nendoroid Petit set of ClariS in January 2012 based on the illustrations of Clara and Alice by Hiro Kanzaki for "Irony". ClariS released their second single on February 2, 2011. "Connect" debuted at No. 5 on Oricon's weekly singles chart, and was used as the opening theme of the 2011 anime TV series "Puella Magi Madoka Magica". "Connect" was later awarded the Gold Disc by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in January 2012 for having exceeded 100,000 copies shipped in a single year. ClariS contributed the song "True Blue" on the Zone tribute album released on August 10, 2011; "True Blue" is a cover of Zone's 2003 single.
ClariS released their third single "Nexus" on September 14, 2011, and it debuted at No. 5 on Oricon's weekly singles chart. Again composed by Kz, "Nexus" was used as the opening theme of the "Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable ga Tsuzuku Wake ga Nai" video game, as well as the theme song for the ninth volume of the "Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai" light novels; ClariS make a cameo appearance in the same volume. The song "Don't Cry" on the "Nexus" single was used as the theme song for volume 0.5 of Shueisha's "Aoharu" magazine. ClariS released their fourth single on February 1, 2012, and it debuted at No. 2 on Oricon's weekly singles chart. "Naisho no Hanashi" was composed by Ryo of Supercell and is used as the ending theme of the 2012 anime TV series "Nisemonogatari".
2012–present: High school and Alice's departure.
Clara and Alice graduated from junior high school in March 2012. ClariS released their debut studio album "Birthday" on April 11, 2012. The album was released in three editions: a regular edition of just the CD, a limited edition bundled with a DVD, and another limited edition bundled with two Nendoroid Petit figures of ClariS based on the illustrations of Clara and Alice by Ume Aoki for "Connect", and a bonus CD with two Nendoroid theme songs. "Birthday" was awarded a Gold Disc by the RIAJ in May 2012. ClariS released their fifth single "Wake Up" on August 15, 2012; the song is used as the opening theme to the 2012 anime television series "". Their sixth single was released on October 10, 2012; the song is used as the opening theme to the first two "Puella Magi Madoka Magica" anime films. Their seventh single "Reunion", composed by Kz, was released on April 17, 2013; the song is used as the opening theme to the 2013 anime television series "Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai.", the series' second season.
ClariS released their second studio album "Second Story" on June 26, 2013. Their eighth single was released on October 30, 2013; the song is used as the opening theme to the film "". Their ninth single "Click", composed by Kz, was released on January 29, 2014; the song is used as the first opening theme to the 2014 anime television series "Nisekoi". Their tenth single "Step", again composed by Kz, was released on April 16, 2014; the song is used as the second opening theme to "Nisekoi". ClariS released their third studio album "Party Time" on June 4, 2014, which was Alice's last contribution with ClariS.

From their formation until 2014, ClariS consisted of two high school girls from Hokkaido known as Clara and Alice (both pseudonyms, done so to preserve their anonymity). ClariS is a portmanteau of the singers' names and was picked as an homage to the character Clarisse from the anime film "The Castle of Cagliostro". As listed on their website, "ClariS" can also carry the meaning of "clear" and "bright" in Latin (though it is actually spelled "clarus"). Both Clara and Alice have been singing since they were in kindergarten, when they started taking lessons at the same music school where they met as classmates. Clara can play the piano.
In order to put a priority on their schoolwork, ClariS have not released photos of themselves to the public and employ illustrators to draw their likenesses. When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, and the sun is used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly wavy hair and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with straight hair with bangs. To further preserve their anonymity, Clara and Alice have not told anyone they know (aside from their families) that they debuted as music artists. Both admit that they are otaku, and have taken an interest in anime and anime music. Clara says that she keeps her otaku interests a secret from others at school, and Alice has called herself a Disney otaku.

Grade beam

A grade beam or grade beam footing is a component of a building's foundation. It consists of a reinforced concrete beam that transmits the load from a bearing wall into spaced foundations such as pile caps or caissons. It is used in conditions where the surface soil’s load-bearing capacity is less than the anticipated design loads.
A grade beam differs from a wall footing because a grade beam is designed for bending and typically spans between pile caps or caissons, while a wall footing bears on soil and transmits the weight of the wall directly into the ground. It also differs from a strap beam because a grade beam is reinforced to distribute the weight of a wall to separate foundations, while a strap beam is designed to redistribute the weight of a column between footings.
Grade beams may also be used in conjunction with spread footings, in a case with large moments from lateral loads, in order to reduce the size of each spread footing.

Peter Spink

Peter Spink (17 August 1926 – 22 November 2010) was an English Anglican priest, Canon of Coventry Cathedral, mystic, spiritual teacher, writer and founder of the "Omega Order", a mixed teaching and contemplative community.
Biography.
George Peter Arthur Spink was born in Gaddesby, Leicestershire, and, after leaving school, worked as a tea-packer and in coal mines. In his late teens he became a Christian and went on to train as a missionary, spending 5 years evangelising to the villages of northern India from 1949 to 1954. On his return to England he was ordained as an Anglican priest, spending the years from 1956 to 1959 as a curate in two parishes in the Midlands - one a large housing estate. It was here, that he became convinced of the importance of the healing ministry after laying hands on a seriously ill child who subsequently recovered.
From 1959, Revd. Spink served as a chaplain to British embassies in Bonn, Vienna, Prague and Budapest. On returning to England he became a chaplain at Coventry Cathedral, then Canon residentiary in 1970. From 1977 to 1980, he was warden at Burrswood Home of healing, an independent Christian non-surgical hospital. While at Burrswood he founded a small community in a formerly-derelict house in Tunbridge Wells, which became the Omega Order, a mixed ecumenical and teaching order.
In 1981, Spink left Burrswood to become the full-time Warden of the "Omega Order", which, in 1986, moved its headquarters to Winford manor in Winford, Somerset which it occupied until around 2000. He made several appearance on television, and was the subject of one part of the religious series ""Inner Journeys"" (HTV, 5 December 1993) where he described his spiritual quest for understanding. He converted to Catholicism around 2000.
In later life Spink suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in November 2010, aged 84. He was married to Ruby (née Cox), a fellow missionary in 1948, and had a daughter, Kathryn Spink, a notable writer and biographer.
Teaching.
Spink wrote several books expounding a philosophy of "experiential wisdom" rather than conventional religious belief, mirroring his own "escape from the box" which allowed him "glimpses of the Cosmic or universal Christ towards which Jesus so clearly points". In his last book, ""Beyond Belief"" (1996), he described his teaching as for those "who are looking for a God...who can be known and experienced directly". His own influences included Christian mysticism, Teilhard de Chardin, Sufism, George Gurdjieff, Rudolf Steiner and Theosophy; his approach has been described as "New Age" by some.
The purpose of the "Omega Order", which he founded, was to help people move beyond the confines of orthodox religious belief to a more intuitive, mystical appreciation of God. The philosophy of the order was encapsulated in a written testament called the "Omega vision". The order published several books (and a regular journal called "Omega News") and functioned as a retreat and course center, based at Winford Priory in Somerset, as well as housing a small contemplative and teaching community of monks and nuns. The offices were celebrated daily.

William Henry Stowe

William Henry Stowe (1 January 182522 June 1855), scholar and journalist, eldest son of William and Mary Stowe, was born at Buckingham on 1 January 1825. After attending a school at Iffley, near Oxford, he spent six months at King Edward's School, Birmingham. Leaving at Easter 1840, he studied medicine for three years at Buckingham, but, finding the pursuit uncongenial, entered at Wadham College, Oxford, in January 1844. At Oxford he was intimately associated with George Granville Bradley (afterwards Dean of Westminster), John Conington, and other members of the Rugby set. In 1848 he was placed in the first class in the final classical school with Edward Parry (afterwards Bishop Suffragan of Dover) and William Stubbs (afterwards Bishop of Oxford). After occupying himself for two years in private tuition at Oxford, he began in 1851 a connection with "The Times" by contributing literary articles, among them a comparison of the characteristics of Thackeray and Dickens. In March 1852 he obtained an open fellowship at Oriel College, and afterwards entered at Lincoln's Inn.
In May 1852 John Walter, the proprietor, gave him a permanent post on the staff of "The Times". His work for the paper was mainly confined to literary subjects, although he wrote many leading articles on miscellaneous topics. His reviews of John William Kaye's "History of the War in Afghanistan" and of Dickens's "David Copperfield" were reissued in "Essays from the Times" (2nd ser. 1854), edited by Samuel Phillips. Other literary notices by him of interest were on "Niebuhr's Letters" (1853) and on "The Mechanical Inventions of James Watt" (1855). His obituary article on Lord Brougham appeared in "The Times" of 11 May 1868, thirteen years after Stowe's own death.
In 1855 "The Times" organised a "sick and wounded fund" for the relief of the British army in the Crimea, and Stowe was selected to proceed to the east as the fund's almoner. He reached Constantinople (now Istanbul) before the end of February, and was soon at Scutari (now Üsküdar), whence he moved to Balaklava. There he visited the hospitals and camp, and reported on the defects of the sanitary situation. "Others talked, Mr. Stowe acted," wrote Frances Margaret Taylor, the author of "Eastern Hospitals and English Nurses" (1857). On 16 March his first letter from the Crimea appeared in "The Times", and described the Balaklava hospitals and the health of the army. Many further despatches on like subjects followed up to midsummer 1855. Two of Stowe's letters (Nos. 80 and 81) described the third bombardment of Sebastopol, and were included in "The Times" Crimean War correspondent William Howard Russell's "The War" (1855). But Stowe's health was unable to resist the fatigue and exposure to an unhealthy climate which were incident to his labours. He died of camp fever at Balaklava on 22 June 1855 and was buried in the cemetery there (see "Illustrated London News", 22 November 1855). A cenotaph to his memory was erected by friends in the chapel of Oriel College. John Walter, in a leading article in "The Times" of 6 July 1855, recounted Stowe's experiences in the Crimea, and characterised his despatches as "an astonishing effort of intellectual and descriptive talent."

Liam Redmond

Liam Redmond (27 July 1913 – 31 October 1989) was an Irish actor known for his stage, film and television roles.
Early life.
Redmond was one of four children born to cabinet-maker Thomas and Eileen Redmond. Educated at the Christian Brothers schools in Dublin, he later attended at University College, Dublin and initially read medicine before moving into drama.
Acting career.
While Director of the Dramatic Society he met and married the society's secretary Barbara MacDonagh (sister of Donagh MacDonagh and daughter of 1916 Rising leader Thomas MacDonagh). They had four children.
Redmond was invited to join the Abbey Theatre in 1935 as a producer by William Butler Yeats, the Irish poet. Yeats wrote his play "Death of Cuchullain" for Redmond to star as Cúchullain, hero of one of Ireland's foundational myths.
Redmond made his acting debut at the Abbey Theatre in 1935 in Sean O'Casey's "The Silver Tassie". His first stage appearance was in 1939 in New York in "The White Steed". After returning to Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War he was a regular on the London stage. He was one of the founders of WAAMA, the Writers', Artists', Actors' and Musicians' Association, a precursor of Irish Actors' Equity. His insistence that "part-time professionals" – usually civil servants who acted on the side – should be paid a higher rate than professional actors for both rehearsal time and performance, effectively wiped out this class, raising the wages and fees of working actors.
He starred in Broadway, among other plays starring in Paul Vincent Carroll's 1939 "The White Steed"; in 1955 playing Canon McCooey in "The Wayward Saint" winning the George Jean Nathan Award for his performance, and in 1968 starring in Joe Orton's "Loot" and Brian Friel's "The Loves of Cass Maguire".
Redmond worked in TV and film throughout the 1950s to the 1980s and was regularly seen in TV series such as "The Avengers", "Daniel Boone", "The Saint" and "Z-Cars". He was often called upon as a character actor in various military, religious and judicial roles in films such as "I See a Dark Stranger" (1946), "Captain Boycott" (1947), "High Treason" (1951), "The Cruel Sea" (1953), "Playboy of the Western World" (1962), "Kid Galahad" (1962), "The Luck of Ginger Coffey" (1964), "Tobruk" (1967), "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" (1968) and "Barry Lyndon" (1975). His performance as the kindly occult expert in the cult horror film Night of the Demon (1957) is a favourite of nerds.
Redmond retired to Dublin and died aged 76 after a long period of ill heath in 1989. His wife Barbara predeceased him in 1987.

Ice Prince

Panshak Zamani (born October 30, 1986), better known by his stage name Ice Prince, is a Nigerian hip hop recording artist and actor. He rose to fame after releasing "Oleku", one of Nigeria's most remixed songs of all time. He won the 2009 Hennessy Artistry Club Tour. His achievements include one BET Award, one Ghana Music Award, three The Headies Awards from 12 nominations, two Nigeria Entertainment Awards from 6 nominations, and two Channel O Music Video Awards from 7 nominations. Ice Prince is currently signed to Chocolate City. His debut studio album, "Everybody Loves Ice Prince", was released in 2011. It was supported by the singles "Oleku", "Superstar", "Juju", and "Magician". In 2013, Ice Prince released "Fire of Zamani", his second studio album. The album contained the singles "Aboki", "More", "Gimme Dat", and "I Swear".
Early life and music career.
Ice Prince was born Panshak Henri Zamani in the city of Minna, Niger State, Nigeria. At age two, he moved with his family to the mining city of Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. While residing in Jos, he attended St. Murumba College, the same school that produced P-Square, footballer John Obi Mikel, and the Governor of Bauchi State Isa Yuguda, among others. He also attended the Science Tutorial College in Jos.
In 1998, he began writing rap songs and started performing them at social events held at his school. It was not until 2001 that he began going to studios to record. In 2002, he got together with a couple of friends and formed a group called the "Ecomog Squad". They had few performances as a group and split a year later. In 2004, he connected with M.I, Jesse Jagz, Ruby, Lindsey, Eve, Taz, and together they became what is now known today as the "Loopy Crew". During an interview with Adeola Adeyemo, Ice Prince was asked to summarize his story. He said "I started out in Jos in a group called ECOMOG squad. We used to rap and sing together. The group split up after a few years and after that, I joined the choir in my church and started singing Tenor. That was about the time MI moved back to Nigeria and we became friends, we became family, we started living together, started making music together. I had a song that made it to Number 1 in Jos, that was when I started getting more attention. Then I got admitted into University of Jos to study Zoology but then I couldn’t really continue because of some financial constraint at the time." Ice Prince also opened up about the passing of his parents and the challenges he faced early on. He said: "Life was not that rosy. When my dad was alive, life was pretty much rosy but I lost my Dad in 1999 and it was my Mum that was taking care of me up until she died too. So it was kinda hard to get by, really. I dropped out of school in my 100Level to focus on my music.I moved to Abuja and started living with MI and Jesse Jagz. We were making music, doing some small small shows just to get money. Then we moved to Lagos, we got a chance to chill at Djinee’s house. Djinee gave us some space in his house to sleep. Djinee is like my Jesus. He came through for us. We lived in his house and made it very uncomfortable for him but he took all the pain and accommodated us. This was in 2008. Gradually, there was steady growth. We got our own place, started making music. In 2008, I hosted Sprite Triple Slam. We did 30 shows, 15 in Lagos, 15 in the East. I got some small money off that to buy some new jeans and shoes so that girls would, you know, say hi to me when they see me." 
In 2004, Ice Prince released his debut single "Extraordinary". "Rewind", another single he released, received radio airplay in Lagos and Abuja. It charted on Rhythm Fm's "Top 7 chart", Notjustok's "Hype", Unilag FM, Zain Central Station, Inspiration Fm, Top FM’s "Top of the Morning", Cosmo FM's "Top Hits", Africa Connect Chat Show, and Kiss' "Top 20 Africa". Moreover, it charted at number 1 on Cool FM and Vision FM in Abuja.
Chocolate City record contract.
During the aforementioned interview, Ice Prince shed some light on his record deal with Chocolate City, saying: "My record deal with Chocolate City came off of my affiliation with MI and Jesse Jagz. We are pretty much brothers, we’ve always lived together, always been together. But then Chocolate City signed MI first. It was like they did it in order of our age. Then they signed Jesse Jagz. Jesse was obviously more ready than I was at that time. Then they saw that I was getting ready as well and they signed me too."
2009: "Hennessy Artistry".
In 2009, Ice Prince participated in the Hennessy Artistry competition, a competition organized by the Hennessy brand which supports urban and contemporary music. The competition featured the likes of Bez, Mo'cheddah, Blaise, and Jimmy Flames; Ice Prince came out 1st with his lead single "Badman" at the end of the competition.
2010-2011: "Everybody Loves Ice Prince (E.L.I)", "Oleku", and collaborations.
During the aforementioned interview, Ice Prince opened up about why he chose to name his debut album, "Everybody Loves Ice Prince". He said "What made me give my album that name was when I lost my Mum, really. There was so much love, so much care from all around the world. People really showed me love and it was after that incident that I came back to record my album and I thought what better name to call my album than Everybody Loves Ice Prince because I was shown love. "Oleku", Ice Prince's first single off his debut album was met with great reception throughout Nigeria. The song was released under Chocolate City. Ice Prince's 'rap resume' has a long list of songs he’s been featured on. He was featured on Taikoon's "Respect My Hustle" with Banky W, DJ Neptune's "This Gbedu Reloaded" with YQ & Shank, Bez's "Super Sun (Remix)" with ELDee & Eva Alordiah, YQ's "Efimile (Remix)" with Naeto C, M.I, Banky W, & ELDee, Pherowshuz's "Korrect (remix)" with M.I & Terry Tha Rapman, Dekunle Fuji's "Funmilayo" with Jesse Jagz, Jamix's "My Party" with Wizkid & Kel, Reminisce's "2 Mussh " with Sauce Kid, and Knighthouse's "Make it Better" with Mo’Cheddah, Funbi, & Mobie, among others.
2012-2013 :"Fire of Zamani".
In 2012, he began frequent collaborations with Grip Boiz City producer Chopstix, releasing "Aboki" in the summer of 2012. An accompanying music video was released alongside it. "Aboki" peaked at number 92 on Afribiz's Top 100 chart.
On August 28, 2012, Ice Prince released "More", the second single from off the album. The song was also produced by Chopstix. The music video for "More" was shot and directed in London by Moe Musa. It stars Lola Rae, a British Nigerian recording artist known for her single, "Watch My Ting Go". The video premiered at the 2012 Channel O Music Video Awards, an awards ceremony he co-hosted.
On January 25, 2013, Ice Prince released "Aboki (Remix)", a song he describes as the "biggest African collision ever". The song features Sarkodie, Mercy Johnson, Wizkid, M.I, and Khuli Chana.
On April 24, 2013, Ice Prince and Chocolate City released "Gimme Dat" and "V.I.P" simultaneously. The former made the album's final track-listing while the latter didn't.
Musical influences.
Ice Prince cited Notorious B.I.G., Rakim, Jay-Z, Common, Talib Kweli, Kanye West, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Lauryn Hill, M.I and Jesse Jagz as his key musical influences. Commenting on his relationship with label mate M.I, Ice Prince said: "He is my brother, he is my friend, my mentor. He is someone that if 200 people tell me no and MI tells me yes, I would do the yes. That is how loyal I am to him, that is how I respect him, how much I look up to him. He never gives me bad advice, he wishes me well and he’s always happy when I succeed."
Personal life.
Ice Prince has a son named Jamal with Bimbo Babatunde. In an interview with the "Nigerian Tribune", the rapper said that he dated Eva Alordiah when he first relocated to Lagos.

<doc id="30929019" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30929019" title="Flextank">
Flextank

A flextank is a flexible/foldable storage tank, made of several layers of different materials like PVC and other polylined foils and are used for storage of drinking water and fuels. Flextank is a brand name in the Netherlands.
Advantages.
An empty flextank can be stored easily in a carton or wooden box, depending on the size of the tank. A Flextank can be re-used many times during many years and therefore ideal for temporary used tank capacity.
Uses.
Flextanks are commonly used as additional fuel storage on board small ships and yachts, passing the ocean or making long voyages. A 25,000 litre storage tank can be easily shipped by air freight or can be delivered to an offshore platform by helicopter or small work boats easily. Flextanks are specially designed to be used under heavy conditions at sea in rough weather conditions, or to be transported in empty condition by air or sea. They are used for salvage operations at sea, where it is important to empty gasoil tanks from a ship in distress or sinking before the gasoil can leak into the sea.
In forests or on islands where there is no water available for firefighting or emergency cases, flextanks can easily be placed on places where normal traffic is impossible. Flextanks can also be transported fully loaded under a helicopter or on deck of a ship or boat or on a flat truck to enable quick delivery of water or fuels or other liquids in emergency circumstances. Flextanks have been successfully used for firefighting in Russia and Greece and salvage operations in the Atlantic Ocean.

Care of Cell 44

"Care of Cell 44" is a single by The Zombies, from their 1968 album "Odessey and Oracle". It was featured on Pitchfork Media's 200 Best Songs of the 1960s list, and has since been covered by modern artists including Elliott Smith and Of Montreal.
Content.
"Care of Cell 44" tells the story of a person writing to their partner in prison, as they await their release from prison. Rod Argent, the Zombies main songwriter said "It just appealed to me. That twist on a common scenario, I just can't wait for you to come home to me again". Given the subject matter, the music accompanying this is very upbeat and jaunty, and has been described as "the sunniest song ever written about the impending release of a prison inmate." Arts journalist Matt Kivel described the music as a "sprightly piano jingle." The melody incorporates multiple key changes.
Reception.
At its time of release as the lead single for "Odessey and Oracle" in 1967, the track was not a success, causing some of the tension that led to the eventual breakup of the band in December of that year. Colin Blunstone, the group's vocalist said, "I thought that "Care of Cell 44" was incredibly commercial. I was really disappointed when it wasn't a hit."
However, subsequent critical reappraisal of the album, following both the success of "Time of the Season" the following year and the album's later cult following has led to the track becoming much more popular, resulting in several cover versions from modern artists.
Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald calls it a "breezy, infectious pop melody" with "choral harmony breaks," and particularly praises Chris White's "melodic" bass playing. He also remarks that the song shows its Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney influences but remains original. Matt Kivel claims that "in three minutes and fifty three seconds The Zombies have slyly redefined the lyrical conventions of a modern pop song." Music critic Antonio Mendez called it one of the sublime songs on "Odessey and Oracle".

Prabhutaratna

Prabhūtaratna (Skt: प्रभूतरत्न; Traditional Chinese: 多寶; Simplified Chinese: 多宝; pinyin: "duō bǎo"; Japanese: 多宝如来 "Ta takara nyorai" or "Tahō nyorai"), also known as Abundant Treasures, is the Buddha whom Shakyamuni is closely associated with in the Threefold Lotus Sutra, namely in the Lotus Sutra itself and the Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra.
In the Lotus Sutra.
In the 11th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Prabhūtaratna is depicted as seated next to Shakyamuni Buddha within the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha, to whom all the buddhas from the "ten directions," and those in the great assembly, come to hear the Dharma, and is said to reside in a land "tens of millions of billions of countless worlds to the east" called "Treasure Purity".
Within a stupa called "Precious Stupa," or the "Stupa of the Precious Seven Materials", is where Prabhūtaratna resides and in which he appears to manifest himself when bearing witness to the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. This stupa is believed to symbolize buddha-nature which all people possess, while the springing-up of the stupa from the earth is said to imply the discovery of one's own buddha-nature.
Prabhutaratna made a vow that when the lotus sutra was preached his stupa containing his relics would appear from below the earth. When Gutama Buddha opened the stupa Prabhutaratna was apparently alive again, and the two incarnations spoke to one another.

Milano Greco Pirelli railway station

Milano Greco Pirelli railway station () is one of the main stations serving the city and "comune" of Milan, capital of the region of Lombardy, northern Italy. Opened in 1914, it is in the north of the city, in the "quartiere" (English: "district") of Greco. It forms part of the Milan–Monza railway.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.
Location.
Milano Greco Pirelli railway station is situated in Via Roberto Cozzi, at the southeastern edge of central Greco.
History.
The station was opened on 29 March 1914. At that time, it was located in the then "comune" of Greco Milanese (annexed to Milan in 1923).
The station has for decades served the nearby Pirelli factories, until their disposal at the end of the twentieth century. The disposel was followed by a strong urban redevelopment leading to the new modern district designed by the architect Vittorio Gregotti. Inside the new district are the new University of Milan Bicocca and the Teatro degli Arcimboldi.
The next major station to the north is Sesto San Giovanni. To the south are Milano Centrale and Milano Lambrate. Since 1966, the station has also been connected to Milano Porta Garibaldi through a newly built tunnel. The tunnel portal is to the south of Mirabello, near Piazza Carbonari (the so-called "Passantino").

Eulaminna, Western Australia

Eulaminna is an abandoned town located between Leonora and Laverton along the Old Leonora Road in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.
Lots were originally surveyed in 1900 to serve the nearby Murrin Murrin Copper Mine that was known as the Anaconda Copper Mine at the time. By 1903 there were 64 residential lots and a population of about 350. A police station was also established in 1903 and the town boasted two hotels, two stores a chemist and a newsagent. A mail receiver was in place but no telegraph station. The townsite was originally gazetted as Anaconda in 1904, but the name was changed in 1907 after a request from the WA Copper company because of confusion in the London markets between Copper shipments from Anaconda in the United States and shipments from the local mine. The name was changed to the Aboriginal name for the area, "Eulaminna", in 1907.

Lotus Flower (song)

"Lotus Flower" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. It was released in 2011 on their eighth studio album "The King of Limbs". The song was first played live with lead singer Thom Yorke's band Atoms for Peace, albeit very differently from the version on the album. Musically, the song has less focus on its rhythm section than on the first half of the album, while lyrically, it is about "the magic of losing yourself in music and the senses".
"Lotus Flower" received very positive reviews from critics, with many highlighting it as the best song from "The King of Limbs". The music video featuring black-and-white footage of Yorke dancing sparked an internet meme where people dubbed the footage with audio of different songs or of their own voices. "Lotus Flower" was nominated for Best Rock Performance, Best Rock Song, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 54th Grammy Awards. Despite not being released as a single, it charted on the UK Singles Chart, the Ultratop 50, the US Alternative Songs chart, and the US Rock Songs chart.
Background and recording.
The song was first played live during a tour with Atoms for Peace, on 2 October 2009, at the Echoplex in Los Angeles, as a solo guitar and vocal piece. It was later performed once by Radiohead with similar instrumentation, at the Radiohead for Haiti concert in January 2010. "Lotus Flower", like the rest of "The King of Limbs", was possibly recorded in the house of actress Drew Barrymore, as she is thanked in the album's liner notes.
Composition.
The song is driven by five minutes of a repeating beat. It features lead singer Thom Yorke's layered falsetto vocals over a striding bass line and drums. It contains a large amount of reverberation, and it combines the "keyboard-and-drum machine sound" of "Kid A" and the "sonic warmth" of "In Rainbows". The tempo is slowed down from the previous tracks, and the emphasis is placed on Yorke's vocals.
Arnold Pan of PopMatters stated that "Everything seems amped up on the track; the synthesized grooves are deeper and heavier, the syncopated beats more precise and relentless, while Yorke’s approximation of a R&B falsetto reaches for more and hits higher notes, at least in a figurative sense." The track has Radiohead focusing less on their rhythm section and contains a more traditional song structure than on the first half of the album. It is one of the only songs on "The King of Limbs" that has an "actual" chorus." Luke Lewis of the "NME" speculated that the lyrics are about "transcendence, self-effacement", and "the magic of losing yourself in music and the senses".
Reception.
The song received positive reviews from critics. "Billboard" named it the high point of "The King of Limbs", while "The New York Times" called it the "standout" of the album. The A.V. Club named "Lotus Flower" "The King of Limbs" catchiest song, a sensually slinky come-on that’s one remix away from being a dance-floor favorite". "The Independent" described the track as "not exactly a singalong anthem" but also said it was the "notional single" that is "just blank and cryptic enough to sustain various interpretations". The "NME" said the following of "Lotus Flower": "a subtle but powerful song this is, anchored by a sleekly propulsive bass line and capped with a truly beautiful, almost Prince-like falsetto vocal." At the 54th Grammy Award Ceremony, the song was nominated for Best Rock Performance, and Best Rock Song, but lost both.
Music video.
A music video was released on 18 February 2011 and features black-and-white footage of Yorke dancing while singing the song. It was directed by Hammer & Tongs member Garth Jennings and choreographed by Wayne McGregor. The video was originally uploaded on the band's official YouTube channel on February 16, 2011. The video led to the tag #thomdance to become a trending topic on Twitter. It also sparked an internet meme named "Dancing Thom Yorke" where people replaced the audio of the "Lotus Flower" video with other songs, or dubbed different voices on the video. The video received a nomination for Best Short Form Music Video at the 2012 Grammy Awards.
The video received positive reviews from critics. IndieWire wrote that director Jennings was able to turn Yorke's "spastic" dancing into art. The website described the concept as "simple" and genius", and said the video was "bizarrely compelling [...] with Yorke's flailing, curiously spellbinding limbs as the main attraction." The British newspaper Metro held a "music video fight club" where they judged the music videos for "Lotus Flower" and "Hold It Against Me" by Britney Spears to see which one was better. They praised the dancing of Yorke, saying "somehow, even though he seems to be mass of tangled limbs in the grip of an attack of some sort, it works." The newspaper, however, criticized the visuals of the video, describing the empty room as "sparse to say the least". They declared "Lotus Flower" the winner of the "music video fight club", two points to one point.

Fatality statistics in the Western Australian mining industry

These are Fatality statistics in the Western Australian mining industry which capture the number of people killed in the industry in the Australian state of Western Australia. The Department of Mines and Petroleum, DMP, the governing authority for the industry in the state, has published statistics for fatalities in mining dating back to 1943. Eventually, the department plans to publish statistics dating back to 1886, also these will not be able to be complete. Records up until 1967 are not categorised by commodity and instead appear as "not categorised" in the listing. From 1967, categorisation began and, after 1968, almost all fatalities are categorised.
The department lists the fatality statistics categorised by commodity, date, fiscal year, occupation, causes, report status and type of mining, meaning underground or surface.
In 2006, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia commissioned a taxonomic study to analyse the 306 mining fatalities which occurred between 1970 and 2006.
As of December 2013, the latest fatality that has occurred in the Western Australian mining industry was on 29 December 2013 at Fortescue Metals Group's Christmas Creek mine. After a period of almost 2 years without a fatality between August 2011 and August 2013, three fatalities have occurred since then.
The statistics do not include the 2000 Australia Beechcraft King Air crash, when a flight to the Gwalia Gold Mine, with seven Sons of Gwalia employees onboard failed to land, instead continuing on to Burketown, where it eventually crashed, having run out of fuel. The pilot and the planes seven passengers were all killed.

Brian O'Connor (cricketer)

Brian Redmond Devereaux O'Connor (5 July 1913 – 17 December 1963) was an Australian first-class cricketer who played Sheffield Shield cricket for Queensland.
O'Connor, a right-arm fast-medium opening bowler and lower order batsman, made four of his five first-class matches in the 1934/35 Sheffield Shield season. He struggled on his debut, against South Australia at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, going wicket-less in the first innings and conceding 80 runs off just 13 overs. In the second innings he dismissed opener Vic Richardson and then helped Queensland win the match by scoring 11 not out from nine in the batting order, securing a narrow three wicket victory.
His next appearance was at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Victoria and he was more successful with the ball, claiming 2/72, with the wickets of Leo O'Brien and Len Darling. The Queenslanders were outplayed on this occasions and were unable to score enough runs to make the Victorians bat a second time. He again played against South Australia for his third Shield match, this time at Adelaide Oval. In statistically his worst bowling effort, he finished with 0/120 off only 17 overs in South Australia's first innings, as each of their top four batsmen scored centuries. Chasing a small total, the home side won by eight wickets, with O'Connor picking up the wicket of Frank Collins. In his last Sheffield Shield appearance, O'Connor was part of the Queensland team which played New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His only contribution was the wicket of Ted white, caught and bowled.
The following summer, O'Connor was called into the team to play the Marylebone Cricket Club in Brisbane. He opening the bowling with Eddie Gilbert in the MCC's only innings and took 1/54, with Joe Hardstaff his wicket. After being run-out for 13 in his first innings, O'Connor posted his highest score in the second, making 20 before he was sent back to the pavilion. Although he never again played for Queensland, O'Connor continued to compete at grade level for Eastern Suburbs and topped the bowling averages in 1939/40.
He was the only son of Leo O'Connor, a Queensland cricket captain who also led his state in Australian rules football interstate matches. Like his father, O'Connor was a Queensland representative in both sports. He played for South Brisbane in the Queensland Australian National Football League. They were not his only sports, he also played rugby union with the GPS Rugby Club.
During the war, O'Connor served as a pilot with the Royal Australian Air Force. He flew a Hampden torpedo bomber with the 455 Squadron, where he was a Squadron Leader.

Dynamic (record label)

Dynamic is an Italian independent record label located in Genoa. Founded in 1978, it specialises in classical music and opera, especially rarely performed works and has produced several world premiere recordings. The Dynamic catalogue contains over 400 titles, with about 25 new titles added each year and is distributed in 32 countries.
History.
Dynamic was founded in 1978 by Pietro Mosetti Casaretto and his wife Marisa. Mosetti Casaretto, a surgeon and amateur violinist, took over a small label founded by the musicologist Edward Neill. In the beginning, Dynamic was a small family business. Mosetti Casaretto and his wife recorded in local churches, oratories and villas. The first recordings were issued on vinyl, the very first one being Paganini's "Barucabà Variations" played by Salvatore Accardo. 
In 1985 the company moved to its current site in the Villa Quartana on the Righi hill overlooking Genoa, where it set up a recording hall that could house a small chamber orchestra. In the late 1990s Mosetti Casaretto retired, and management of the label was taken over by his son-in-law, Alberto Dellepiane. Over the years, the label's focus on chamber music and particularly violin music has widened to include full-length opera recordings on both CD and DVD. More recently, Dynamic has become a high definition content producer for television and cinema.
Notable recordings.
Dynamic has recorded on DVD several live opera performances at La Fenice — "Il crociato in Egitto", "Le roi de Lahore", "Maometto secondo", "Thaïs", "Pia de' Tolomei", "Didone", "Death in Venice", "Les pêcheurs de perles", and Baldassare Galuppi's rarely performed "L'Olimpiade". For the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, they have recorded on DVD "L'equivoco stravagante", "Ermione", "La gazza ladra", "Torvaldo e Dorliska", "Bianca e Falliero", "L'italiana in Algeri", and on CD "La cambiale di matrimonio" and "Il turco in Italia".

Gera Hauptbahnhof

Gera Central Station () is the main station of the Thuringian town of Gera. Gera is one of the largest cities in Germany with no long-distance rail connections and no electrified lines. The station is a significant regional transport hub. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 3 station.
History.
The railway was extended in 1859 from Weißenfels to Gera via Zeitz (the Weißenfels–Zeitz and Leipzig–Probstzella lines). At that time, the first station was built at the site of today's Hauptbahnhof as the Prussian station ("Preußische Bahnhof"), as distinct from the Saxon station ("Sächsischen Bahnhof") at today's Gera Süd station. In the following years further lines were built converging on Gera Hauptbahnhof: in 1865 the connection with the Leipzig–Hof line at Gößnitz to the east, in 1871 to Saalfeld in the south-west (Leipzig–Probstzella line), in 1873 to Leipzig in the north (Leipzig–Probstzella line), in 1875 to Plauen in the south (Elster Valley Railway), in 1876 to Erfurt in the west (Weimar–Gera line) and to Zwickau in the south-east (Werdau–Weida–Mehltheuer line), in 1880 to Eisenberg in the northwest (Crossen–Porstendorf line) and in 1883 to Zeulenroda-Triebes and Hof in the south east (Werdau–Weida–Mehltheuer line). Located north of the passenger station was a combined marshalling and yard, connected to a railway depot, both of which are now closed. In 1892, shortly after the opening of the tram network, a facility was built in the freight yard for transferring freight wagons, supported by metre-gauge tram bogies, over the tram lines to factories in Gera. A tram line was opened in 1893 from the station to the central city.
In 1881 the reception building was built by the architects of Hude & Hennicke. During the reconstruction of 1958/63 several ornaments were removed from the facade.
The heyday of the station was between the two world wars, after the glass concourse was completed in 1911. At that time some of the Berlin–Leipzig–Munich traffic ran via Gera and the lines to Saalfeld, Erfurt and Leipzig were double track.
After the Second World War, the second track was removed as war reparations to the Soviet Union. Gera lost its importance as a junction because of the division of German. The major north-south traffic from Berlin to Bavaria no longer stopped at the station.
After German reunification, some secondary lines were closed down (to Zwickau via Wünschendorf and to Eisenberg), while the building of new infrastructure has also been discussed. Politically, this is highly controversial, especially the Mid Germany Connection ("Mitte-Deutschland-Verbindung"), running in an east-west direction through Gera.
In the 1990s there were long-distance trains through Gera, but north–south traffic shifted to the electrified, double track and upgraded Saal line through Jena and east–west traffic runs on the electrified, double track and upgraded lines through Leipzig, so now only regional traffic runs through the station. Between 2002 and 2006, a private InterConnex service operated to Berlin and on to Rostock, but in 2006 it was replaced for cost reasons by an electrically operated service, which therefore had to terminate in Leipzig, rather than Gera.

Rumba Rapids

Rumba Rapids is a rapids ride at Thorpe Park, Chertsey, Surrey. It opened in 1987 under the name of Thunder River, and is the oldest ride currently still in service at Thorpe Park. In 2002, it was refurbished and along with other improvements, its name was changed to Ribena Rumba Rapids because of its sponsor, Ribena. In 2006 Ribena's sponsorship contract ended and the ride was named simply Rumba Rapids for the 2007 season. Since the refurbishment in 2002 the ride has become significantly slower.
Ride.
The ride starts in the station at the top of a hill. The boats then go around a bend down a hill, it then goes round another bend and into a tunnel. The tunnel sometimes has a waterfall feature on the entrance. The tunnel also features a waterfall feature within the tunnel although the boat does not go through it. The boat then exits the tunnel towards a wave machine with rocks in front of it. In the rare occasion that the occupants of the boat all sit on the side facing the wave machine it is possible to get stuck in between the centre rocks, however this usually requires more than four people. The boat goes under a bridge which is part of the queue line. It goes towards a tower with an oversized shower head attached. This shower head used to drop water on the unsuspecting guests but was removed. The tower currently holds an On Ride Photo camera. The boat then approaches a series of water jets and stops at the lift hill. After a short wait the boat goes up the lift hill back to the station. A staff member guides you out of the boat and you exit going past the On Ride Photo booth. The exit gate features a reptile on a wall squirting water at you.
Accident.
In the ride's opening year of 1986 an 11-year-old boy named Jonathan White was thrown from a boat and lost an ear. The news was broken by Children's BBC TV news programme, Newsround.

Dick Costolo

Dick Costolo is the current CEO of Twitter and was its former COO. He took over as CEO from Evan Williams in October 2010.
Biography.
He graduated in 1985 with a B.S. degree in computer and communication sciences, from the University of Michigan, where he was also a brother in the Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity. Costolo became involved in theater during his senior year at the University of Michigan, when he began taking theater classes to fulfill the university's graduation requirements. Upon graduation, he decided not to accept offers from technology companies and instead moved to Chicago to work in improvisational comedy.
After his improv career in Chicago, Costolo was at Andersen Consulting for 8 years, where he was a senior manager in product and technology groups. He then co-founded Burning Door Networked Media, a web design and development consulting company, which was acquired by Digital Knowledge Assets in October 1996. He then co-founded SpyOnIt, a web page monitoring service, which was sold to 724 Solutions in September 2000. 
In 2004, Costolo, along with Eric Lunt, Steve Olechowski, and Matt Shobe, founded the web feed management provider FeedBurner. After Google bought FeedBurner in 2007, Dick Costolo became an employee of the search giant. After the acquisition, Costolo began working in other areas of Google. In July 2009, he left Google, and in September 2009, it was announced that he was joining Twitter as its COO. Although his 2010 takeover as CEO was supposed to be temporary, while CEO Evan Williams was on paternity leave, it eventually became a permanent position.
In May 2011, it was announced that President Obama had appointed Costolo to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, along with the Corporate Vice President of Microsoft’s Trustworthy Computing Group, Scott Charney, and McAfee President of Security David DeWalt. 
In January 2012, he was embroiled in the SOPA controversy after commenting on Wikipedia's planned blackout. [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia_anti-SOPA_blackout] He stated, "That's just silly. Closing a global business in reaction to single-issue national politics is foolish." 
In 2013, Business Insider referred to him as "one of Silicon Valley's most impressive CEOs" [http://www.businessinsider.com/4-of-silicon-valleys-most-impressive-ceos-just-ate-dinner-together-2013-5], and TIME Magazine named him one of the 10 Most Influential U.S. Tech CEOs.

Synopsis.
Urdu, the Hindustani language whose words resonate music, is fast dying. So is Babba, an old Urdu poet who is dying an unknown death. Having shut his eyes to the callous world that weighs art with money, he has woven a charming little world of his own. Babba's state of nonchalant bliss inadvertently drives his daughter Minni into a world of bitter silences. And, across the road lives Pappan, a small-time debt-ridden publisher who is eyeing Babba's treasured verses and his beautiful daughter. A self-indulgent, romantic old man, a stoic but essentially soft-hearted daughter and an opportunist but naive publisher. Amidst all this, Babba, Minni and Pappan struggle to keep their culture alive, their ethos alive, their language alive, their love alive...in vain...

Buc-ee's

Buc-ee's, Ltd is a chain of convenience stores located in the Central and Gulf Coast region of Texas. The company is owned by Arch "Beaver" Aplin III & Don Wasek and has its headquarters in Lake Jackson, Texas.
History.
Business partners Arch "Beaver" Aplin III & Don Wasek, opened their first store in Lake Jackson, Texas in 1982 (which still stands today). Aplin formed the name Buc-ee's for the establishment by combining his nickname, the name his Labrador Retriever, and the name of "Bucky Beaver", the mascot created for Ipana toothpaste in the 1950s by Disney Commercial Studios. The Buc-ee’s brand marketing emphasizes quality products, reasonable prices, heavily discounted ice, and provision of clean bathrooms. Based on the success of their first store, Aplin & Wasek repeated the format throughout their home of Brazoria County, along the Texas State Highway 288 corridor catering mostly to neighbors, boaters and families headed to Lake Jackson, Freeport & Surfside Beach.
Buc-ee's expanded and opened their first travel center in Luling, Texas at the intersection of Interstate 10 & US Highway 90. Buc-ee's travel centers are large stores that typically cover over 60,000 of square footage with large restrooms that contain over 40 urinals and toilets, fueling areas that range from 32-64 pumps, and a full-service deli that features a wide selection of beef jerky, pastries, prepared sandwiches, tacos, Dippin' Dots and homemade fudge. 
Additional travel centers have been built in recent years in Madisonville, Texas on Interstate 45, Wharton, Texas on U.S. Hwy. 59, Bastrop, Texas on TX State Highway 71, Waller, Texas on U.S. Hwy. 290, and Texas City, Texas on Interstate 45 between Houston & Galveston.
In 2012, Buc-ee's opened its largest store in New Braunfels, Texas on Interstate 35. The New Braunfels travel center is the largest convenience store in the world at 68,000 square feet.

Saleh al-Ali

Saleh al-Ali or Shaykh Saleh Ahmad al-Ali () (b. Al-Shaykh Badr, 1884 - d. Tartus, 13 April 1950) was a prominent Syrian Alawi leader that commanded of the Syrian Revolt of 1919, one of the first rebellions against the French mandate of Syria before the Great Syrian Revolt.
Background.
Saleh al-Ali was born in 1884 to a family of Alawi notables from Ash-Shaykh Badr, in An-Nusayriyah Mountains in northwest Syria. He reportedly clashed with the Ottomans in 1918 before their withdrawal from Syria.
Rebellion against the French.
Start of the rebellion.
In 1918 the French occupied the Syrian coast and began to move into the interior. On December 15, 1918, Saleh al-Ali called for a meeting of prominent Alawi notables in the town of Sheikh Badr. Al-Ali alerted the attendees that the French had already occupied the Syrian coast with the intention of separating the region from the rest of the country, and urged them to revolt and expel the French from Syria. When the French authorities heard of the meeting, they sent a force from Al-Qadmus to the town of Sheikh Badr in order to arrest Saleh al-Ali. Al-Ali and his men ambushed the force at the village of Niha, west of Wadi al-Oyoun. The French forces were defeated and suffered more than 35 casualties.
Organizing the rebellion.
After the initial victory, al-Ali started to organize his rebels into a disciplined force, with its own general command and military ranks. The army was supported by the local population, and some women supplied water and food and replaced the men at work in the fields. Al-Ali also allied himself with the rebellion of Ibrahim Hananu in Aleppo, the uprising in Talkalakh by the Dandashi tribe and the revolt in Antioch by Subhi Barakat. He also received funds and arms from Kemal Atatürk of Turkey which was also at war with France at the time.
In July 1919, in retaliation to French attacks against rebel positions, al-Ali attacked and occupied several Ismaili villages that were allied to the French. A truce was concluded between the two, but the French violated it by occupying and burning the village of Kaf al-Jaz. Al-Ali retaliated by attacking and occupying al-Qadmus from which the French conducted their military operations against him.
Final stages.
The balance of power began to shift in favor of the French after they conquered Damascus, defeating a makeshift army at the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920. In November, General Henri Gouraud mounted a full-fledged campaign against Saleh al-Ali's forces in the An-Nusayriyah Mountains. They entered al-Ali's village of Ash-Shaykh Badr and arrested many Alawi notables. Al-Ali fled to the north, but a large French force overran his positions and al-Ali went into hiding. A French court-martial convened in Latakia and sentenced him to death "in absentia".
Later years.
Al-Ali remained in hiding until General Gouraud issued a general amnesty in 1922. He returned to his home and abstained from all political activity until his death on 13 April 1950 in Tartus.
Legacy.
Saleh Al-Ali became a celebrated figure after the Syria's independence. Al-Ali, in his first public appearance since 1922, was a guest of honor of president Shukri al-Quwatli at the Evacuation Day celebrations on 17 April 1946.

Martin Chilcott

Martin Chilcott (born 12 December 1965) is a British entrepreneur specializing in environment and education, best known as the founder and CEO of 2degrees, the world’s largest community for sustainable business.
His first successful business venture was CTSS, a specialist technology marketing company, with colleague and friend James Tarin. In 1995, he established Clarity Communications, followed by various companies that included Meltwater Ventures, a green business incubation service.
Early life.
Chilcott was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, the son of Rosemary and Michael John-Patrick Chilcott. Chilcott was educated at St Josephs College, Ipswich before going on to study History at Clare College, Cambridge.
Career.
In 1989, Chilcott started CTSS, a specialist technology marketing consultancy, with his current business partner, James Tarin. Their main client for 5 years was a small start-up business called The Carphone Warehouse, which would grow into Europe’s largest independent mobile phone retailer. As a result of its success, Chilcott’s business moved to London and in 1995 founded Clarity IBD Ltd, an e-business consultancy that would work with Abbey National and National Rail to create online content. This was later acquired by Proxicom, another e-business consultancy. After various further business ventures Chilcott co-founded Place Group, an educational consultancy company, in 2005. He would spend the next few years working alongside local authorities and national government programs until, by 2008, they were the market leader in delivering school-academy transitions in the UK.
A year after the founding of Place Group, Chilcott started a business incubator called Meltwater Ventures that specialized in environmental programs and resource scarcity. Meltwater Ventures would eventually generate the idea for 2degrees.
2degrees.
By 2006, Chilcott had been drawn to sustainability and carbon reduction, having seen the opportunity build on a valuable business niche there. He, along with James Tarin, recognized that many business were attempting to solve similar sustainability problems independent of each other, but that and that there was no online community which could be used to connect them and collectively solve problems. This thinking led to the founding of the 2degrees Community in 2008 and, by 2011, it was the world largest Community for Sustainable Business and had offices in the UK and US.
Personal life.
Martin Chilcott currently lives in Oxford and currently spends his time between his family, his business and maintaining his Dutch barge.
He is also a trustee of Oxford business x, a youth enterprise scheme based at the Said Business School in Oxford.
In 2011, he sat on the panel of judges for The Guardian's Sustainable Business Awards 2011.

Alan B. Miller

Alan B. Miller is a businessman who is the founder of Universal Health Services, Inc., and currently serves as the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Miller founded the company in 1978 and it has grown to become one of the largest healthcare companies in the nation, with annuals revenues of more than $7 billion.
Early years.
Alan B. Miller was born in Brooklyn, NY on August 17, 1937. His father owned a dry cleaner store and his mother worked for a millinery company. As a youth, Miller was active in sports but also worked after-school jobs as a delivery clerk for a grocery store and for Western Union.
Miller’s six foot-five inch height, and basketball skills helped lead his high school team to an undefeated season and a New York City championship in 1954. He received a full scholarship to the University of Utah.
Military service.
While he was in college, Miller joined the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), and was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army and served in the 77th Infantry Division after he completed his education.
Early career.
Miller began his career in the advertising industry at Young & Rubicam in New York, one of the industry’s largest advertising agencies. As the agency’s youngest vice president, Miller learned about entrepreneurship and risk-taking as he worked with his clients. For example, while he was at Y&R, Miller was instrumental in developing one of the first nationally syndicated television programs, a show called “Cooking With Graham Kerr.”
When his former Wharton roommate came to him in 1969 with an idea for a business, Miller decided to leave the advertising industry for a new venture. His new company, called American Medicorp, would build privately owned hospitals in high growth areas—such as California, Nevada, Texas and Florida—that had few hospitals.
Four years later, in 1973, the company was in financial trouble and Miller’s partner had left the company. Miller took over as CEO of American Medicorp and engineered a turnaround that brought attention within the healthcare industry. American Medicorp became the target of a hostile takeover by Humana in 1978.
Faced with losing the company, Miller fought Humana’s takeover bid. While he was ultimately not able to thwart the takeover, he did force Humana to raise the price it paid for American Medicorp, and generated additional money for all company shareholders.
Career.
As his college athletics had taught him, Miller knew that whenever he got knocked down, the best thing he could do was get back up and start over. So the day after he lost American Medicorp to a hostile takeover, Alan B. Miller started a new company in the same industry. The new company was called Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) and was started with funding from venture capitalists, along with money put up by himself and several former American Medicorp employees who decided to follow Miller into his new venture.
Following the same formula for success that had helped him rebuild American Medicorp, Miller has transformed Universal Health Services, Inc. from a start-up company that had six employees and zero revenue in 1978 into a Fortune 500 company that is one of the nation’s largest healthcare corporations. The company currently owns 221 acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities and ambulatory units, has nearly 60,000 employees and generates annual revenues of more than $7.0 billion.
Current position.
Universal Health Services, Inc., has consistently been among the healthcare industry’s top performers. For example, in the face of a slowing national economy and difficult conditions in the healthcare industry, UHS recorded all-time high earnings results.
The company has consistently been a top performer on Wall Street and was named the Top Healthcare Provider by "Fortune" in 2003 for its compounded 20-percent annual growth from 1992 to 2002. UHS has also been named to the Forbes Platinum 400 list of best large companies in America for profitability and growth.
Miller has said that he makes integrity and ethics a foundation for himself and the company he runs. “I believe that reputation is one of the most important assets for any business and should be guarded carefully,” he says. “While it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, it can vanish overnight.”
In addition to his work with UHS, Miller serves on the boards of directors of The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and Broadlane.
Key civic affiliations and known philanthropic activities.
Throughout his career, Alan Miller has been an ardent supporter of education for students of all economic backgrounds. He served on the executive board of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and is currently a member of The Board of Overseers of the internationally known business school.
He has served as a trustee of The College of William & Mary Endowment Fund and is a life member of the college’s President’s Council. In 2007, the College of William & Mary announced the creation of the Alan B. Miller Center for Entrepreneurship in recognition of Miller’s extensive support for his alma mater. The center, as well as the entire Mason School of Business at the College of William & Mary, will be housed in the new Alan B. Miller Hall. Miller has also served as trustee of the William & Mary Endowment Fund and Is a life member of the school’s President’s Council.
In addition to his work with the business school at the College of William & Mary, Miller also funded the construction of the campus gymnasium and established liberal arts and basketball scholarships to honor his parents, Mary and Manuel.
Miller’s involvement is not limited to colleges where he studied. For example, when the University of South Carolina Aiken needed help persuading the state legislature to fund the construction of a new building for its nursing school, he provided a significant financial gift that made it possible to get the remainder of the money it needed from the state of South Carolina. Today, the Alan B. Miller Nursing Building stands on the campus as a reminder of Alan's spirit of community involvement. In 1995 Miller received an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the University of South Carolina Aiken.
He has also served as the chairman of the Philadelphia United Negro College Fund Corporate Campaign, and received that organizations Chairman’s Award in 1996.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, an organization in which he was active for years, has also honored Miller.
A lover of the opera, Miller is chairman emeritus of the Opera Company of Philadelphia and also serves as a director of the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia.
Awards.
In April 1999, Miller received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the Federation of American Health Systems in recognition of his work. Miller also received the FAHS Award for leadership in 1978. He was named Master Entrepreneur of the Year in 1991, an award sponsored by Ernst & Young and Merrill Lynch, and Financial World magazine listed him among the Outstanding 1000 CEOs in 1995 and 1996.

In 2010, Miller received the Horatio Alger Award from the Horatio Alger Association, an organization that honors self-made successes who rose through adversity and provides scholarship money to encourage promising students to follow their dreams.

Euryglottis albostigmata

Euryglottis albostigmata is a moth of the Sphingidae family. It is known from Colombia and Peru.
It is very different from other species in the "Euryglottis" genus, particularly in colour as well as the absence of a pale angle-shaped marking in submarginal area on the forewing upperside. The hindwing upperside of the females is more extensively white than in males.

Cordylus cordylus

Cordylus cordylus (the Cape girdled lizard), is a medium-sized lizard indigenous to the southern Cape of South Africa.
The Cape girdled lizard has a golden-brown body with spiny, keeled, body scales - especially on its tail.
It is indigenous to the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, from Saldanha and Cape Town eastwards as far as Lesotho. It lives in large colonies (with social hierarchies), on rocky crags and outcrops, as well as on mountain summits. The lizards hide in rocky cracks, but come out in the morning and evening to forage. If threatened, they retreat to their holes and cracks in the rocks, wedge themselves in and lock their bodies there by inflating their lungs. Jammed into the cracks like this, with their thorny tail wrapped protectively over their faces, they are incredibly difficult to prise out. They can often be seen sunbathing on top of prominent rocks. In the autumn, the females give birth to one or two young, which stay very near the mother for the first year.
They feed on insects on which they run out and pounce.

OpenPuff

OpenPuff Steganography and Watermarking, sometimes abbreviated OpenPuff or Puff, is a freeware steganography tool for Microsoft Windows created by Cosimo Oliboni and still maintained as independent software. The program is notable for being the first steganography tool (version 1.01 released on December 2004) that:
Last revision supports a wide range of carrier formats
Use.
OpenPuff is used primarily for anonymous asynchronous data sharing:
The advantage of steganography, over cryptography alone, is that messages do not attract attention to themselves. Plainly visible encrypted messages — no matter how unbreakable — will arouse suspicion, and may in themselves be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal. Therefore, whereas cryptography protects the contents of a message, steganography can be said to protect both messages and communicating parties.
Watermarking is the action of signing a file with an ID or copyright mark. OpenPuff does it in an invisible steganographic way, applied to any supported carrier. The invisible mark, being not password protected, is accessible by everyone (using the program).
Multi-cryptography.
OpenPuff is a semi-open source program:
Cryptographic algorithms (16 taken from AES, NESSIE and CRYPTREC) are joined into a unique multi-cryptography algorithm:
Statistical resistance.
Extensive testing has been performed on the statistical resistance properties of the CSPRNG and multi-cryptography modules, using the ENT, NIST and DIEHARD test suites. Provided results are taken from 64KB, 128KB, ... 256MB samples:
Steganalysis resistance.
Security, performance and steganalysis resistance are conflicting trade-offs.
vs. Performance: Whitening
vs. Steganalysis: Cryptography + Whitening
Data, before carrier injection, is encrypted and whitened: a small amount of hidden data turns into a big chunk of pseudorandom "suspicious data". Carrier injection encodes it using a non linear covering function that takes also original carrier bits as input. Modified carriers will need much less change (Con1) and, lowering their random-like statistical response, deceive many steganalysis tests (Con2).
Deniable steganography.
There will always be a non-negligible probability of being detected, even if the hidden stream behaves like a “natural container” (unpredictable side-effects, being caught in Flagrante delicto, etc.). Resisting these unpredictable attacks is also possible, even when the user is forced (by legal or physical coercion) to provide a valid password. Deniable steganography (a decoy-based technique) allows the user to deny convincingly the fact that sensitive data is being hidden. The user needs to provide some expendable decoy data that he would plausibly want to keep confidential and reveal it to the attacker, claiming that this is all there is.

Black Society for Salvation

The Black Society for Salvation () was a secret Albanian nationalist society established in 1909. Its main task was to organize uprisings in southern Albania and Macedonia struggling for the unification of the four Ottoman vilayets with the substantial Albanian population (Kosovo Vilayet, Scutari Vilayet, Monastir Vilayet and Janina Vilayet) into one autonomous political unit with its own government and parliament. The members of the society considered the armed rebellions as legitimate means for achieving their aims.
History.
According to Nebi Dervishi, the society somehow dates back to 1878 in Istambul. Dervishi explained that its seal contains a gun and dagger, with the name of the society on top, and number 18 and 78 (left and right), showing a connection with the League of Prizren period. The society got reorganized and got its real structure in 1909 in Monastir (today's Bitola in Macedona), in the same building which hosted the The Alphabet Congress. Monastir was a cradle of irredentist movements, not only Albanian ones. The main contributor was Themistokli Gërmenji. The later, had several trips to visit the Albanian colonies, and found great support especially in the colonies of Sofia and Bucharest. Other main members of this were Thoma Avrami, Nikolla Ivanaj, and Pandeli Cale. The statute of the society () was printed in a local print shop owned by the Qiriazi (Kyrias) family, and had 47 articles. The society established branches throughout the vilayets, in Korçë, Yannina, Gjirokastër, Vlorë, Filat, Delvinë, Përmet, Elbasan, Tiranë, Ohër, Strugë, Dibër, Shkup, Shkodër, as well as in diaspora. The branches used a similar seal, without the letter "Q" that was present in the Monastir's one for distincting the "headquarters" (). The intended name from the beginning was "The Black Hand" (), in resonance with other secret societies that carried similar name in Europe, but was shifted later for avoiding misunderstandings regarding the society's programme and activity. A correspondence of Fan Noli to one of the founders, Nikolla Ivanaj, shows Noli's disagreement with these naming convention which sounded to him like the "Mano Nera". Despite the efforts of Ivanaj for changing the name to "National Organization of Albania" (), the name did not change due to objections from the branches.
The society had a secret character which conformed with that of the other secret societies throughout the world. Membership was allowed only to highly trusted persons. Only the initials were used instead of the real names. This makes its structure, membership, and activities more difficult to be study.
Albanian revolts in 1911 and 1912.
The Albanian revolts in the period before the First Balkan War were organized mostly in the territory of the Kosovo vilayet. Isa Boletini, one of the leaders of the Albanian insurgents in Kosovo vilayet, wrote a proclamation on March 23, 1911 to the Albanians in the south to join the Albanians from the Kosovo vilayet in their uprising. He sent his emissaries on April 15, 1911 to pass his proclamation to the southern insurgents. One of the main tasks of Black Society for Salvation was to organize uprisings in the southern territories. The members of the society organized a meeting in Kolonjë. The meeting was attended by the emissaries from the Kosovo vilayet who brought the proclamation of Isa Boletini. The leaders of the society decided in that meeting to organize groups of armed rebels and to launch the uprising in the south in early June 1911. The society managed to establish committees in several towns including Korçë, Elbasan, Debar and Ohrid, but it failed to maintain control over them because each committee acted on its own direction.
During 1911 the Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottoman Empire first managed to pacify the northern Albanian malësorë (highlanders) from Scutari Vilayet reaching a compromise during a meeting in Podgorica. In order to resolve the problems in the south, the Ottoman representatives invited Albanian southern leaders to a meeting on August 18, 1911. They promised to meet most of their demands, like general amnesty, the opening of Albanian language schools, and the restriction that military service was to be performed only in the territory of the vilayets with substantial Albanian population. Other demands included requiring administrative officers to learn the Albanian language, and that the possession of weapons would be permitted.
When the Albanian revolt broke out in 1912 the Black Society for Salvation issued a proclamation to the Albanians from the south of Albania and the Monastir inviting them to participate in the revolt.
First Balkan War.
When the First Balkan War broke out, some members of the society met in Skopje on October 14, 1912, and composed the declaration which was delivered to the consuls of the Great Powers on October 16. With this declaration they informed the Great Powers that Albanians were going to go against the Balkan allies not to protect the Ottoman Empire, but to protect territorial integrity of the Albanian vilayet. They decided to send emissaries to "malësorë" in northern Albania, to organize the resistance in the whole region and to call for an Albanian national assembly. However, the fighting during the war prevented the emissaries from completing their tasks.
The Society's branch in Skopje also organized an unsuccessful assembly to declare the unification of the four vilayets on October 14, 1912.

Charlotte Gyllenhammar

Charlotte Gyllenhammar, born 1963, is a fine artist based in Stockholm, Sweden. She began her career as a painter, but swiftly moved on to sculpture and installation after completing her studies at the Royal College of Art in London. In 1993, she broke through the Swedish art scene when she suspended a 120-year-old tree over Drottninggatan, the main street in the center of Stockholm. The work entitled "Die for You" was the first step in a progression of images and environments that invert perspective. For example, confinement and inversion are evident in her video/photographic series of suspended women entitled "Belle", 1998, "Disobedience", 1998, "Fall", 1999, and more recently "Hang" 2006. The series "Hang" is composed of both color or c-prints and gelatin silver prints. The photographs were first premiered at Paris Photo in 2006, in the Central Exhibition, which was dedicated to the Nordic countries, where Gyllenhammar represented Sweden. 
Charlotte Gyllenhammar, has in her artistic production, investigated issues such as identity, the boundaries between public and private, captivity, and terrorism. Her oeuvre is characterised by a formalist sensibility and deviating perspectives. Sculptural installations include "Vertigo", 2002 at Wånas sculpture park in Sweden. "Vertigo" was a large installation where Gyllenhammar created a full-scale subterranean and inverted replica of her studio. Gyllenhammar has since become one of Sweden’s most prominent contemporary artists. A major exhibition of her work entitled "Private Idiot" was held at Kulturhuset, in the heart of Stockholm, which later travelled to Dunkers Kulturhus in Helsingborg, Sweden. An accompanying book was published in conjunction with the award winning exhibition. In addition, Gyllenhammar has completed a series of important public works such as the "Raoul Wallenberg Memorial", 2007 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Her installation "Wait, the smallest of us is dead" has been exhibited at Glasstress, a collateral event of 2011 Venice Biennale. Her work is featured in several significant collections including the Moderna Museet, Sweden; the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C., United States; and Kiasma, Finland.
Charlotte Gyllenhammar is the daughter of Pehr G. Gyllenhammar.

2011–12 Philadelphia Flyers season

The 2011–12 Philadelphia Flyers season was the Flyers' 45th season in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flyers lost in the second round of the playoffs to the New Jersey Devils in five games.
Off-season.
Following his penchant for making big moves, Flyers GM Paul Holmgren pulled off perhaps the most stunning move of his tenure, trading captain Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 2nd-round draft pick, and Jeff Carter to the Columbus Blue Jackets for their 2011 1st-round pick (Sean Couturier) and Jakub Voracek all within the span of an hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing Phoenix's Ilya Bryzgalov to a 9-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a 1-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a 5-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a 2-year contract.
Regular season.
Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the season he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome.
Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to subpar, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3-2 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.
The Flyers concluded the regular season with the most power-play opportunities of all teams (335), the most power-play goals scored (66), and the most power-play opportunities against (319).
Playoffs.
The Flyers drew the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the playoffs, a series in which the two teams combined for an NHL-record 45 goals in the first 4 games and a total of 309 penalty minutes in an intense, fight-filled series. The Flyers pulled off the upset in 6 games against a Pittsburgh team that was heavily favored to win the Stanley Cup. But in the second round against the New Jersey Devils, the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and the Flyers were eliminated in 5 games.

Erica verticillata

Erica verticillata is a species of erica that was naturally restricted to the city of Cape Town but is now classified as Extinct in the Wild. 
Distribution.
It formerly grew only in certain areas of the Cape Flats on the Cape Peninsula of South Africa.
Habitat.
It grew in Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, a fynbos type that is threatened by urban sprawl and fragmentation. It preferred damp sandy soils such as those that were naturally found around Wynberg, Kenilworth and Zeekoevlei.
Conservation.
Although the species became functionally extinct due to agricultural and urban development of its habitat in the early 20th century, cuttings from several plants discovered in the wild in the later 20th century have ensured that the species will continue in cultivation. 1984 saw the introduction of cuttings from two specimen, one in Protea Park, Pretoria and another in Kew. The former were collected by Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden scholar David von Well after he recognized the plant from herbarium sheets photocopied by Kirstenbosch erica horticulturist Deon Kotze. The third infusion came from a plant found by Kirstenbosch foreman Adonis Adonis in a clearing. 
This species was introduced back into the wild at Rondevlei, a bird sanctuary and nature reserve in Cape Town.
Ecology.
Various pollinators such as bees and birds such as Southern Double-collared Sunbirds have been observed feeding on the tubular pink flowers on "E. verticillata". 
Cultivation.
"E. verticillata" comes in three forms: the Kirstenbosch form, the Pretoria form and the Kew form. It prefers seasonally moist sandy soils, but will grow well in average garden conditions provided the soils are acidic. The best time to plant is in autumn or during the winter although they may be planted at other times of the year if regularly watered. It is important to never disturb its roots when weeding. Plants should be well watered after planting and then every two to three days unless good rainfalls occur.

Pendlebury Colliery

Pendlebury Colliery, usually called Wheatsheaf Colliery after the adjacent public house, was a coal mine operating on the Manchester Coalfield after 1846 in Pendlebury, Greater Manchester, then in the historic county of Lancashire, England.
The colliery, sunk in 1846, was owned by Andrew Knowles and Sons and had two ten foot diameter shafts 24 yards apart.>
The pit originally had a pitch pine timber headgear and a winding engine supplied by John Musgrave & Sons of Bolton which operated until 1944.
The colliery was ventilated by furnace and by the 20th century ventilation fans had been installed. Wrought iron boilers to raise steam to power pumps, air compressors and haulage were originally sited near the bottom of No.2 shaft, the upcast shaft. The shaft bottom was at 1,775 feet. The colliery accessed several seams including the Rams, Crumbouke and Doe mines.

In 1936, he accepted the editorship of the "Daily Herald", serving until 1940. In 1941, he became Controller of Press Censorship and News at the Ministry of Information, and for his work he was awarded a CBE in 1945.

Saramsa Garden

Saramsa Garden is a public garden approximately 14 km east of Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, India. Established in 1922, the garden has served a variety of purposes. Initially dedicated to growing fruit for the local colonial officers, it later became known for cultivating the medicinal plant ipecacuanha. For this reason the garden is also known as Ipecac Garden. When the growing of ipecacuanha was discontinued, the garden was repurposed as an orchidarium and a recreational garden for picknickers. In 2008, the garden hosted the International Floriculture Show, attracting 50,000 visitors on each of its three days.
Location.
Saramsa Garden is nestled between the hill slopes of Gangtok and Pakyong. The park is situated approximately 14 km away from the capital town on the Pakyong road.
History.
The garden was established in 1922 by the Sikkim Forest Department. From 1922-1954 the Forest Manager nurtured the garden as his pet project with intense involvement in introduction of plants. His interest in botany, floriculture and horticulture largely helped in his pursuit. Initially established with the main purpose of growing different fruits like pineapple, guava, varieties of oranges and lychee for the British Political officer and the Palace, the garden developed into a main center for introduction of fruits.
The practice of growing fruits continued until 1940, after which the Forest Department introduced ipecacuanha from Zohore in Malaysia. This is used in the production of syrup of ipecac, a powerful emetic. Though cultivation of ipecacuanha was discontinued in 1970, the garden is still famous by the name Ipecac Garden.
In 1975, the garden was converted into an Orchidarium for growing different types of orchids. The majority of plants and trees that can been seen growing in the garden at present were introduced from 1975 till 1980. In 2008 the garden hosted the International Flori Show, an event promoted by the Government of Sikkim to promote the region as a centre of floriculture.

Bernard de Girard Haillan

Bernard de Girard Haillan (c.1535–1610) was a French historian.
Biography.
He was born in Bordeaux and occupied a number of political offices before Charles IX appointed him historiographer of France. He was confirmed as historiographer by Henry III, who liked him so well, despite his vanity and selfishness, that he made him genealogist of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and gave him a pension of 1200 crowns. 
Works.
He is considered a follower of Étienne Pasquier, so much so that complaints Pasquier made of plagiarism may have been meant for him. Early works were "État et Succès des affaires de France" (1570) and "Promesse et Dessein de l'histoire de France" (1572). He is best known for "L'histoire générale des rois de France jusqu'à Charles VII inclusivement" (History of the kings of France up to Charles VII, 1576).
