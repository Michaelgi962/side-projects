Pico y placa

Pico y placa "(peak and plate)" is traffic congestion mitigation policy that was initially set in place in the year 1998 in Bogotá, Colombia by then mayor Enrique Peñalosa to help regulate traffic during rush hours. The system restricts vehicles with license plate numbers ending in certain digits from travelling the streets between certain times. Initially the system restricted traffic between 6 and 9 am, and between 5 and 8 pm, Monday through Friday. However, starting 2009, mayor Samuel Moreno extended the restriction from 6 am to 8 pm, Monday through Friday.
The system restricts both private and public use vehicles based on the last digit of the licence plate numbers. Four numbers are restricted every day for private use vehicles, and two for public transportation vehicles. The restricted digits associated to each day rotate every year. The system has been extended to other Colombian cities.
Pico y Placa on 2011 is applied to the following plate endings since July 1, 2011 in Bogotá:

Consumer relationship system

Consumer relationship systems (CRS) are specialized customer relationship management (CRM) software applications that are used to handle a company's dealings with its customers.
Current CRS integrate the software with telephone and call recording systems as well as with corporate systems for input and reporting. Customers can provide input from the company's website directly into the CRS. These systems are popular because they can deliver the ‘voice of the consumer’ that contributes to product quality improvement and that ultimately increase corporate profits.
Consumer relationship systems that provide automated support as well as advanced systems may have artificial intelligence (AI) interfaces that can extract and analyze data collected, or handle basic questions and complaints.
History.
The first CRS was developed in the 1980s. In 1981 Michael Wilke and Robert Thornton founded Wilke/Thornton, Inc in Columbus, Ohio, to develop new CRS software.

Barndarrig () is a tiny village in County Wicklow, Ireland. It is located just off the N11 road.
Public transport access.
The village is served by a bus stop on the N11 road. It is served daily in each direction by several (but not all) coaches on Bus Éireann's "Expressway" route 2 (Wexford-Arklow-Dublin-Dublin Airport). It is also served albeit infrequently by Bus Éireann route 384. The nearest railway station is Wicklow railway station.
Public dissatisfaction over removal of stop from route 2.
Until the end of September 2012 Bus Éireann route 2 used to stop at Ballincor numerous times each day. There was considerable public dissatisfaction with the decision as the bus provides a useful link to hospitals as well as for commuting and leisure purposes. The stop was reinstated in the route 2 timetable from 25 August 2013 (inclusive).

Dental Schools Council

The Dental Schools Council represents the interests of UK dental schools as it relates to national health, wealth, knowledge acquisition through teaching, research, and the profession of dentistry. Composed of the Dean or equivalent of each dental school in the UK, the current chair is Professor Paul M Speight, Dean of the University of Sheffield School of Clinical Dentistry. The Dental Schools Council meet three times per year in February, June and October. 
The Dental Schools Council History.
The Dental Schools Council began life as the "Education Consultative Committee of the Dental Schools of Great Britain" on 31 January 1931 when Mr W. Malcolm Knott (President of the British Dental Association in 1930) invited several Dental Deans to come together to discuss the formation of a Dental School Committee to discuss all matters relating to dental education. Twelve dental schools were represented at the first meeting, with each one donating one guinea each to cover expenses. The first topic discussed was the recommendation of a General Medical Council to maintain dental standards in the United Kingdom. The Education Consultative Committee of the Dental Schools of Great Britain enabled the university staff to play a greater role in determining, co-ordinating and agreeing standards in the dental curriculum. 
Previous names.
The Dental Schools Council has been referred to under many names since its formation. In 1932, a formal constitution was approved resulting in a new name - "The Dental Education Advisory Committee of Great Britain and Ireland", which was later changed in 1937 to the "Dental Education Advisory Council of Great Britain and Ireland" (DEAC). In order to align itself with the Council of Heads of Medical Schools - now the "Medical Schools Council" - the DEAC changed its name in 1993 to the "Council of Deans of Dental Schools" (CDDS). However, it was later decided in 2005 that it was necessary to change the name to "Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools" to reflect that not all members of the organisation were given the title ‘Dean’. 2008 saw a final name change to the "Dental Schools Council" to reflect the expertise at all levels within the dental schools, from not only the Heads and Deans but also other dedicated staff members including admissions tutors, administrators and students themselves. 
Senior Officers Group.
In 2007, the UK Dental Schools Senior Officers Group was convened, fostering formal and regular dialogue on key issues between Dental Schools across the UK at Senior Administrator Level. The Senior Officers Group meet twice a year in February and October (as a joint meeting with the Dental Schools Council). The current Chair is Anna Burrows, Senior Administrator at the University of Sheffield School of Clinical Dentistry.
Members.
The Dental School Council consists of the 18 dental schools in the UK. These are: 
Associated Organisations.
The Dental Schools Council promotes dental education and research through collaboration with Universities UK, the Higher Education Funding Bodies, the National Health Service, Government Departments, the General Dental Council, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the Research Councils, dental research charities, the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Medical Schools Council, the Association of UK University Hospitals, and the British Dental Association.

Quinn Tamm

Quinn Tamm (1910 – January 23, 1986) was an assistant director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and later influential executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). Tamm's older brother Edward Allen Tamm was also an FBI official and later a federal judge. 
Born in Seattle, Washington, Tamm graduated from the University of Virginia. Tamm entered the FBI in 1934, and by 1938 had become what was the youngest person promoted to inspector. Tamm worked the Identification Division for seventeen years until moving up to assistant director of the Training and Inspection Division in 1951. During his tenure as assistant director, Tamm had a tumultuous relationship with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who instructed Tamm to influence IACP activities, such as controlling the election of officers. In 1961 Tamm resigned from the FBI and was elected executive director of the IACP, where he "turned it from a genial club to a highly expert organization." When Tamm joined the IACP they had six full-time staff in makeshift offices, but within five years they had 70 staff and their own building. Hoover considered Tamm a personal threat to his law enforcement power and personally considered Tamm to be his third most hated enemy (after Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.). Tamm died January 23, 1986 at Washington Suburban Hospital after suffering a heart attack.

Mary Rose Trust

The Mary Rose Trust is a limited charitable trust based in Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. Its primary aims are to preserve, display and spread knowledge about the 16th century warship "Mary Rose" which sank in the Solent on 19 July 1545 and was salvaged by the Trust in October 1982.
The Mary Rose Trust runs the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.
History.
The Mary Rose Trust traces its origins back to the Mary Rose Committee, founded in 1968 with the intent to "to find, excavate, raise and preserve for all time such remains of the ship "Mary Rose" as may be of historical or archaeological interest". The wrecksite was scouted and surveyed with side scan sonar in 1967-68, revealing a hidden feature, the first loose timber was located in 1970 and the buried wreck of the "Mary Rose" finally located on 5 May 1971. Throughout the 1970s volunteer divers and archaeologists surveyed the ship and conducted some limited excavations.
In the 1960s and 70s the Mary Rose Committee collaborated with museum representatives, diving clubs and archaeologists to campaign for legal protection of shipwrecks as vital to the national historical heritage. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 stipulated that any wreck that was unclaimed and was salvaged had to be sold to pay for the expenses of the salvers. This meant that any shipwreck old enough to fall under the sway of the Act was threatened by commercial exploitation. Instead of being carefully excavated and recorded by maritime archaeologists, historically invaluable wrecks risked being destroyed by unscrupulous salvers and treasure hunters. The joint organisation Committee for Nautical Archaeology, of which the Mary Rose Committee was a member, successfully lobbied to grant the wreck legal protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act of 1973, with the "Mary Rose" being among the first to receive legal protection. However, the risk of having salvaged artefacts confiscated was still a very real risk under UK salvage law, and a confrontation had to be averted by continuous negotiations with the Receiver of Wreck, a division of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The "Mary Rose", along with a few other historic wrecks, was a vital example during the lobbying for the new shipping act as well as the gradual change in implementation of UK salvage law.
The Committee handled the small-scale diving operations and underwater surveys of the "Mary Rose" wrecksite until 1979, when it was decided that the remnants of the ship should be fully excavated and salvaged. This required considerable financial means and a considerably larger organisation, leading to the foundation of the Mary Rose Trust. Prince Charles acted as its president and Margaret Rule archaeological director in charge of excavating and preparing the wreck of the "Mary Rose" for salvage. The project had already received considerable media attention as well as large donations with which the salvage vessel "Sleipner" was purchased.
On 11 October 1982 the "Mary Rose" was successfully salvaged and towed to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, where it was placed in passive storage until active conservation began in 1994. In the meantime, the Trust built a museum to display exhibits explaining the history of the ship and its 16th century Tudor era context.
Operations.
In 2008, the Mary Rose Trust had assets of close to £10 million and income of over £5,700,000, the majority of which came from various donations. It had 56 employees and a further 50 volunteers. Currently, the Trust is engaged in building a new museum in which the conserved hull of the "Mary Rose" will be displayed along with a selection of the thousands of artefacts found inside and around her.
The Mary Rose Trust is a partner organization of the Swedish Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden, with which it has regular exchanges and collaborative ventures. The Vasa Museum has on display the Swedish 17th century warship "Vasa" which was salvaged from the bottom of Stockholms ström in 1961.

The Lost Revival

The Lost Revival is an indie rock band from Columbus, Ohio. Formed in the Fall of 2005, membership changed several times before the band recorded its first album, "Homemade Confetti", in the Summer of 2007. Band membership changed again before work began on the second album, which has yet to be released.
The band is noticeable for its atypically large and variable size, with as many as nine performers on stage at any one time, and as few as four. The band describes its sound as “bastardized Americana.” The term was coined by drummer John Thorne when the band had trouble describing their sound, a mix of folk-rock and electronic noise.
History.
Formation.
The band began with members Kevin Collins, Daniel Kirschenbaum, and Benjamin Peyton. When Collins’ and Kirschenbaum’s house was burglarized in 2005, they lost some of their original equipment, including Collins’ childhood guitar and several microphones. After recovering some funds from insurance, the band purchased a synthesizer and a drum machine. Collins and Kirschenbaum largely credit this burglary and their subsequent instrument purchases for the creation of the band as it is now.
The band began performing in Columbus in early 2006, making their debut at Larry’s Bar. After a hiatus during the second half of 2006, The Lost Revival came back in 2007 with a different membership. Austin Caulk, Marty Boone, Joe Dewitt, and Brad Wilson joined Collins and Kirschenbaum in the band. According to Collins, everyone in the band is a multi-instrumentalist, and band members frequently change instruments throughout a show.
Name.
Originally called “Youngstown Tune-Up,” the band changed its name to “The Lost Revival” the day before its first record went to press. The band announced the change in a blog post on January 9, 2008 to its MySpace. Chris DeVille of "Columbus Alive" writes that the name change reflects singer/songwriter Collins’ “fixation on religious themes” in the music he writes. DeVille also writes that the band’s name change may have been one of the most important in its history, and that the new name sounds “more dignified.”
"Homemade Confetti".
The Lost Revival announced that production of its first album, "Homemade Confetti", was finished in a January 9, 2008 blog post to its MySpace. The band recorded the album in one weekend in the summer of 2007 with producer and sound engineer Jay Alton at Relay Recording in Columbus, Ohio. The album was recorded on the Columbus independent label, Champions of the Arts. The album was officially released in April 2008. Prior to the release of the album, The Lost Revival gained drummer and videographer John Thorne.
The album’s title came from an incident at a show on Collins’ birthday. Collins reportedly had torn up bits of a newspaper’s obituaries in his pocket, and began to throw the newspaper, yelling “Homemade confetti!”
The announcement of its upcoming album earned The Lost Revival a show at Galapagos Art Space in New York City, the band’s first show outside of Columbus, Ohio. After the band’s CD release party for "Homemade Confetti", the band continued to play around Columbus through mid-July 2008. During this time, "Homemade Confetti" was reviewed by Dave Schaefer of Life on the C-Bus, a local music site for Columbus, Ohio. Schaefer gave the album four out of five buses, and likens the album to “a mix of Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Mike Ness.” Schaefer also describes Collins’ vocals as “cigarette-tuned.” This earned The Lost Revival another show in New York City, at Arlene’s Grocery.
As The Lost Revival continued to play around Ohio, "Homemade Confetti" continued to get reviewed. L. Anne Carrington gave the album four out of five stars in September 2008. David Smith of Delusions of Adequacy reviewed the album in October 2008. Joel Oliphint of Columbus’ "The Other Paper" reviewed the album in November 2008.
In December 2008, Oliphint named "Homemade Confetti" as one of the top ten Columbus albums of 2008 on his blog, “Don’t just do something, stand there.” In January 2009, Chris DeVille of "Columbus Alive" named "Homemade Confetti" one of the best Columbus debut albums of 2008.
Summerfest and the United Nations.
As The Lost Revival gained notoriety, it was entered into a contest to play at local radio station CD101’s Summerfest with other notable indie rock bands VHS or Beta, Dr. Dog, Darker My Love, Honey Honey, Ism, and Tickle Me Pink. The contest was decided by CD101 listeners’ votes by text message. The band won the opening spot at the show, held at the LC Pavilion in Columbus on August 23, 2008.
The Lost Revival was offered to play at the United Nations Correspondents Association Awards Ceremony, and accepted the December 4, 2008 show for the band’s third trip to play in New York City. The band finished out the year performing live for CD101’s Andyman-a-thon.
To Hell With Them All.
The Lost Revival recorded five songs for their second album in December 2008 at Sonic Lounge Studios with producer and engineer Jay Alton. The band had previously recorded demos of these five songs at Rokcity Studios with CD101 DJ Mike Folker.
In January, 2010 the Lost Revival resumed work on the second half of "To Hell With Them All" at Sonic Lounge Studios. They plan to release the second full-release in March, 2010.
Personnel.
The current line-up for The Lost Revival is Kevin Collins (lead vocals, keyboard, guitar), Daniel Kirschenbaum (guitars, keyboard, vocals), Brad Wilson (bass guitar, vocals), Joe Dewitt (synthesizers, keyboard), and Chris Cheeseman (drumset, percussion). Former members are Benjamin Peyton (keyboard), John Thorne (drums, percussion, keyboard), Austin Caulk (percussion, guitar, drumset), and Marty Boone (keyboard).

"Homemade Confetti" (2008)
Press.
""Homemade Confetti", which was reportedly recorded in one weekend, doesn’t sound the least bit like a rush job. It’s a big record, with lots of atmospheric layering in the background, providing a thick blanket in which to wrap Kevin Collins’s throaty vocals—which make him sound like a less lackadaisical, sea urchin-swallowing version of the Black Swans’ Jerry DeCicca."-Joel Oliphint, "The Other Paper"

Mike Adams (footballer)

Michael Alan Adams (born 20 February 1965 in Banwell, Somerset) is an English former professional footballer.
Adams began his career as an apprentice with Bristol Rovers. He played just once for their first team before leaving to join Bath City, initially on loan, in March 1984. His only appearance for "The Pirates" came in the final game of the 1982–83 season; a match that was a memorable one for several reasons. Rovers' previous manager, Bobby Gould, had resigned the day before, their opponents, Cardiff City, won promotion thanks to the point they earned in this 1–1 draw, it was the final professional game for former England international and FIFA World Cup winner Alan Ball, and Rovers player Aidan McCaffery required life-saving treatment from the physio after swallowing his tongue. All of these events combined left Adams's 27-minute cameo at the end of the game somewhat unnoticed.
He signed a permanent contract with Bath late in May 1984 and was a regular with them for four years, scoring 22 times in 175 first team games, until being released in May 1988 by new City manager Harold Jarman. He then spent five years with Weston-super-Mare, before joining Keynsham Town in 1993.

Juliusz Słowacki Polish Grammar School

Juliusz Słowacki Polish Grammar School (), with its seats in the towns of Orłowa (Orlová) and Karwina (Karviná), Czech Republic, was founded in 1909 as the second (and up to 1938 the only in Zaolzie) Polish secondary school at the territory of Cieszyn Silesia.
Reasons for founding.
Cieszyn Silesia changed from an agricultural to an industrial area on the turn of the 19th century. This happened on account of rapid development and expansion of the Ostrawa-Karwina Coal Basin. A great number of workers and professionals arrived to a rather small territory. They were of Polish, Czech and German origin, with a majority of the Polish, who formed 60.6% of the population. The coal mining region thus became a typical multilingual society. Polish intelligentsia soon started to express the need of founding a secondary school, which would prepare future Polish speaking mining and metallurgical engineers.
History.
1909-1920.
On December 8, 1908 the meeting of „Macierz Szkolna“ (Polish educational society) made a decision to establish a private secondary school, expecting it would become government-funded in the near future.
On September 7, 1909 the decree of the new school opening was issued by Austrian Ministry of Education and Religion in Vienna. The inauguration took place on September 23, 1909. The school accepted the name of Juliusz Słowacki, a great Polish romantic poet, whose 100th birth anniversary fell in that particular year. The school has been successful and popular among students since the beginning and undoubtedly reached a very high level of education soon.
During the World War I the school was closed for about 2 months due to teachers´ draft. By November 1914 only two teachers were available for work. A lot of students enlisted in newly formed Polish armed forces voluntarily. There appeared some casualties, too, in the front lines in Italy or Russia. The first graduating exams took place in July 1917.
1920-1939.
The period after World War I seemed to be very turbulent. The independent Czechoslovak Republic was proclaimed on October 28, 1918; the Polish Republic on November 11. Silesia, mainly Cieszyn Silesia, became the eye of conflict between the two.
On May 15, 1920 Polish grammar school was closed for the second time owing to the ethnic riots in Orłowa.
The final partition of Cieszyn Silesia happened on July 28, 1920. Orłowa together with the school remained on the Czechoslovak territory. On September 17, 1920 the school was reopened as a private eight-year secondary school with Polish as the first language.
At the eve of the beginning of the World War II other important events took place. Czechoslovakia was forced to give Cieszyn Silesia to Poland on October 1, 1938. Juliusz Słowacki Polish Grammar School continued its educational work, with mixed Czechoslovak-Polish curriculum.
1939-1945.
However, the period of peaceful existence did not last long. On September 1, 1939 the World War II began. All Silesian Polish schools were closed immediately. The staff dispersed – a part remained in Orłowa, the rest, being afraid of possible Nazi repressive measures, left the region. The predictions of the oppressive Nazi Germany regime proved true. Most of the teachers were soon arrested and taken away to numerous concentration camps, including school principal Piotr Feliks. The pupils had to give up their secondary studies, the children up to the age of 14 were made to attend German schools, the older ones worked in mines and factories, some were sent to forced labour to Germany.
The school building was used as a German miners´ school, then as a teachers´ school and finally a military hospital as well as army barracks at the very end of World War II.
1945–1964.
Orłowa was freed by the Soviet Red Army on May 1–2, 1945 and (because the borders were returned to their 1920 state) it belonged to Czechoslovakia again. The whole Polish population expected restarting of educational process in a short time. So already in May 1945 the School Committee was established. It immediately began to negotiate the reopening of all Polish schools. In the meantime the staff and the students together with their parents started to reconstruct the building of the school. After the testing registration of future number of pupils (when 350 of them signed up) the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education issued the permit for the opening of Juliusz Słowacki Polish Grammar School in Orłowa on September 18, 1945.
However, a few limitations appeared – only Czechoslovak citizens were allowed to be students or teachers, „irreproachable with respect to nationality and political matters.“ On October 1, 1945 the inauguration of the beginning of the school year took place in the school hall after masses in both Catholic and Protestant churches. During the ceremony the attendees commemorated the victims of World War II.
In February 1948, after a bloodless coup, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took over the power in the state. On February 24 the school joined a one-hour strike, organized by Communist Trade Unions Organisation. On February 27 during the first lesson class teachers discussed the changes of the political situation in the state with the pupils. Since then (till 1989) the communist ideology was present in both curriculum and everyday life of the school.
In April 1948 a meeting took place where the principal instructed all the students „in a great importance of a new school system in Czechoslovakia“. According to this reform secondary schools were changed to 4-year-schools, but only in 1953, after another transformation, there appeared so-called „11-year high school“ and in 1960 „general high school“ that lasted for 3 years.
Shortly before the 50th anniversary the school building underwent general repair of central heating and sewerage. Also a new grammar school building was erected in the autumn of the 1960. At the beginning of the 1960s the Ministry of Education ordered secondary schools to join into greater units. According to this resolution grammar school would unite with a Czech school. This decision was opposed by the county inspector of schools. So, eventually, in 1962 a decision was taken that Juliusz Słowacki Polish Grammar School would be joined with a 9-year primary school in the nearby village of Łazy (Lazy). The seat of both schools was established in a new primary school Łazy building. The original grammar school building was deserted. There was („ temporarily“, as its statics was endangered by extensive mining damage in the vicinity) a school for children with special needs and a music-school. The old building was pulled down in 1988.
1964–1992.
During the 1960s transport links in the area changed significantly so this way Orłowa left its importance as a point of junction. Fewer pupils wanted to study in Łazy school. So in 1964 the school was joined with a larger Polish Grammar School in Czeski Cieszyn (Český Těšín). Since September 1, 1969 the school has been working as a 4-year grammar school again. Its main purpose is to educate future students of Czech and Polish universities. However, because the mining damage in the surrounding area (there is Antonín Zápotocký (now Lazy) Mine close to the former school building) gradually developed, a decision was made that school would move to the district city of Karviná.
Since 1993.
By the end of 1992 the Polish Grammar School was transferred to the former primary school building in Karwina, the district of Hranice. There is a private Business and Banking Secondary School as well on the premises. In 1997 school joined the Juliusz Słowacki Schools Association in the Polish city of Chorzów. It takes part in annual meetings held in associated schools in Poland and Ukraine. The 15th meeting was organised in school from April 30 to May 2, 1998 hosting 12 schools named after Juliusz Słowacki.
On June 6, 2009 the 100th anniversary of the school was celebrated in the Centre of Culture in Orłowa-Lutynia. Monument commemorating the school was unveiled at Orłowa-Obroki.

Fredrik Kayser

Fredrik Thorbjørn Kayser, MM (25 May 1918 – 2 February 2009) was a Norwegian resistance member during World War II. He was especially noted for his role in the Norwegian heavy water sabotage, and has been referred to as "Western Norway's Gunnar Sønsteby".
Early life.
Kayser grew up at Paradis in Bergen. Among his youth experiences was a period as a boy scout, under later resistance member Fredrik Rieber-Mohn. When drafted for compulsory military service after finishing school, he enrolled in the His Majesty The King's Guard, finishing his eight months of service in 1938. In 1939, reportedly after attending a performance of the symphonic poem "Finlandia", he volunteered to fight on Finland's side in the Winter War. In 1998 he stated that he "wanted to defeat the Communist system". He also stated that he never actually fired a gunshot.
World War II.
Norway was invaded by Germany on 9 April 1940. Coincidentally, Kayser returned to Norway from Finland on this date, crying as he found the capital city Oslo invaded. He became involved in the fighting that ensued elsewhere in Norway. On 25 April he fought in the Battle of Skjervet in Granvin. The Norwegian forces lost, and retreated to Gudvangen.
From there Kayser travelled to Bergen, where he involved himself in the illegal press. After some time he decided to take part in secret military and sabotage operations. He escaped to England in September 1941, and enrolled in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 led by Martin Linge. Kayser was recruited from the regular training to the so-called Finishing School, where the emphasis was on secret agent skills. His first mission was the Operation Anklet in December 1941. In 1942 he planned Operation Woodcock together with Kasper Idland and Kjell Endresen, two other Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldiers. They were to parachute onto the Nevlandsheia plateau in Gjesdal and from there carry out a sabotage operation against the strategically important Sola Air Station in Western Norway. The team's first attempt to carry out the operation failed due to fog obscuring the drop zone. Further attempts were called off after a French sabotage team was intercepted by the Germans and explosives designed for the operation fell into German hands.
Heavy water sabotage.
In 1942 the British Operation Freshman, directed against the heavy water production facility at Vemork, failed miserably. In 1943 another attempt was made, codenamed Operation Gunnerside. Following an aborted attempt in January, Kayser was a part of the team that successfully parachuted onto the Hardangervidda plateau on 16 February 1943. Kayser was one of the first two saboteurs to enter the Vemork facility on 27 February, crawling through a cable shaft, the other being the team leader, Joachim Rønneberg. They surprised the person who guarded the heavy water cylinders in the factory—in retrospect the guard was described as "a good Norwegian". Kayser, at the time a sergeant, and Rønneberg went on to place explosive charges on the heavy water cylinders in the factory. Two more members of the Gunnerside team later joined Kayser and Rønneberg by climbing through a window. During the operation a Norwegian watchman was temporarily detained, and guarded by Kayser, being released 30 seconds before the explosives went off. The saboteurs of Operation Gunnerside escaped unharmed, even though the German occupying authorities deployed thousands of soldiers to search Hardangervidda for the saboteurs. Kayser made his way to Sweden with four other team members by way of a two-week, ski trek. In all the operation resulted in the destruction of 18 heavy water cells and 500 kg of heavy water, with a loss of production of 400 kg.
For his role in the heavy water sabotage Kayser was awarded the Military Medal by King George VI of the United Kingdom.
Submarines.
After the heavy water sabotage, Kayser returned to England. This time, he was educated in steering one-man midget submarines. In 1944 Kayser and three other men were tasked with assaulting German ships in the harbour of Måløy. However, the plan went sour as locals became alarmed of their presence. Kayser had to escape by land. He reportedly entrenched himself in a marsh for a whole day in order to escape a Gestapo search party.
Bjørn West.
In the last year of the war the Norwegian resistance movement established base areas in remote locations in Norway to provide hiding places for people on the run from the German occupiers. Five base areas were planned, although only two were completed ("Bjørn" and "Elg") by the time of the German capitulation on V-E Day, with a third ("Varg") still under construction. In addition to serve as safe heavens the bases were also to train the refugees in guerilla tactics, using instructors from Norwegian Independent Company 1. Kayser, then a lieutenant, was second-in-command of the base "Bjørn West" at Matre in Masfjorden and took part in the 28 April–3 May 1945 fighting after the base was discovered by the Germans. Kayser had arrived in Masfjorden in October 1944 with a fellow Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldier, second lieutenant Severin Synnes. The two had been transported to Masfjorden from the UK on the Royal Norwegian Navy submarine chaser HNoMS "Vigra" with orders to establish "Bjørn West".
Awards and honours.
In total, Kayser received fourteen decorations for his wartime efforts. In addition to the Military Medal, he received the Légion d'honneur and twice the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch. Thus he was referred to as "Western Norway's Gunnar Sønsteby". On 8 May 2012, on the 67th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe, a memorial to Fredrik Kayser will be unveiled at Storetveit in Bergen.
Post-war life.
Kayser left the military after the war, and spent the rest of his professional career working in the private business sector. He was a member of Fana municipal council for eight years during the 1950s, representing the Conservative Party, although he was not formally a member of the party. He also became a devout Christian after the war.
Kayser played himself in the docudrama "Kampen om tungtvannet", released in 1948. Despite appearing publicly in the film, for several decades Kayser was unwilling to conduct in-depth interviews about his wartime actions. He cited recurring nightmares as the reason for his unwillingness to recapitulate the war period. Ultimately, the writer Kjell Harald Lunde got Kayser's consent, and in 1997 Lunde published the book "Sabotøren" ('The Saboteur'). Kayser had participated in a Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation production on "Bjørn West" in the spring of 1994. Kayser's son, Johan Fr. Kayser, played his father in the television production.
Fredrik Kayser died on 2 February 2009, having suffered from failing health for four months. He had lived in Ågotnes since 1974.

Al Hashimiyya

Geography & Climate.
Hashimiyya is located in the mountainous area that surrounds Ajloun. The town is situated on a ridge that leads eastward down to the floor of the Jordan Valley. The northern and eastern sides of Hashimiyya are bordered by small pockets of forest (Ras Al Khlail and Valley of the Wolves respectively). The climate is Mediterranean-like and similar to the nearby Ajloun Forest Reserve. Hashimiyya lies within the range of the Fertile Crescent making alluvial cultivation possible. Snow and rain are common in the winter months between December and February.
History.
The region around Hashimiyya has been settled since the Bronze Age, as evidenced by archeological excavations in nearby Pella and Abila. The Roman era saw increased settlement and population growth in the region as the Decapolis cities prospered. Though there is little archeological evidence of an ancient town on the site of modern Hashimiyya, the town does contain an ancient olive grove known locally as Al Maisor (الميسر). Furthermore, the village's ancient name, Farah (فارة), may be derived from Viera, a Roman town located in the area. Evidence from pottery found in the area indicates that there was a settlement on the site of modern Hashimiyya during Mamluk/Ayyubid period.
During the Byzantine era the area around Hashimiyya was highly Christianized. Today, ruins from Byzantine churches are strewn throughout the Ajloun Governorate, most notably at Tell Mar Elias. Though Hashimiyya itself does not contain any churches the Haddad family of Christians still lives in the town.
Jordan's 1967 war had a dramatic impact on the population of Hashimiyya. Before the war the town's population was so small that the oldest mosque, The Great Hashimiyya Mosque, wasn't built until 1949 by Hajj Ahmed Abusini. Most of the village's population lived in the western end, with Al-Maisor marking the village's eastern boundary. However, in the aftermath of the war many families from the Jordan Valley chose to move further inside Jordan's border. By 2000 6 more mosques were constructed to accommodate the population swell. Al-Maisor was now within the village's limits and houses reached more than a kilometer further east. Because of this population influx the more established western part of the village became a downtown with shops, bakeries, butchers and blacksmiths. The municipal building grew to contain a health center and later a dentist's office opened nearby. When paved roads came in the 1970s buses between Hashimiyya and Ajloun soon followed, making travel easy between Hashimiyya and Amman.
The development of the town was witnessed by a member of the royal family who visited the town in the 1980s. He was so impressed by the town that he reportedly said that it could no longer be called Farah (meaning musk) and changed the name to Hashimiyya (meaning Hashemite, the name of Jordan's ruling dynasty).
Economy.
Al Hashimiyya's economy relies on agriculture including: wheat, pomegranates, figs, fava beans, olives and vegetables. There are also a number of goat herders. Most people work in agriculture but also work in the Army or education to supplement their income. Many people have more than one job. People in Hashimiyya work in different places but many work in Amman, the capital city.
In Hashimiyya there are four kinds of shops. The first type is supermarkets. Supermarkets have sweets, chips, oil etc. The second kind is restaurants. Restaurants have sandwiches, hummus and some snacks. The third type is electrical markets. They have computers, TV and electrical machines. The last kind is internet cafés where you can surf the net.
Education.
Hashimiyya witnessed many developments in teaching that happened in synchronization with the establishing of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The development appeared in village's first basic and secondary schools. There are five schools in Hashimiyya, a primary/basic (k-6) and secondary (7-12) school for boys, a basic and secondary school for girls and a small coed basic school (k-4). Hashimiyya School for Boys was established in 1925 and many of the students who studied there are now teachers, doctors and politicians. The first girls school was created in 1960.
All students study general science, math, Arabic, English, religion (Islam), geography, physical education and vocational training from 1st to 12th. Starting in 9th grade students study Earth science, physics and chemistry. After 10th grade they study general culture instead of history. The final two years of school (11-12) are called Tawjihi.

Ken Griffiths

Kenneth James "Ken" Griffiths (2 April 1930 – 9 August 2008) was an English footballer. A forward, he scored 59 goals in 221 games in the Football League.
With Port Vale between 1945 and 1958, a bright period of the club's history, he scored 56 goals in 196 appearances in league and cup competitions. He helped the club to the Third Division North title and the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1953–54. He moved on to Mansfield Town in January 1958, before moving into non-league football with Stafford Rangers, Wellington Town, Sankeys, Macclesfield Town, Northwich Victoria, Nantwich Town and Wolstanton United. Griffiths died in August 2008, at the age of 78. He was survived by wife Nancy and daughter Valerie, grandchildren Andrea, Nicola, and Tracey, and five great-grandchildren. He died days apart from former teammate Selwyn Whalley.
Playing career.
Griffiths started playing football for Abbey Hulton Youth Club and then with Basil Hayward for Northwood Mission. During World War II he joined the Royal Air Force. He played inside-left for his unit's team.
He joined Port Vale as an amateur in June 1945 and signed professional forms in February 1950, making his debut under Gordon Hodgson two months later in the 1949–50 season. He scored his first goal at Vale Park on 31 March 1951 in a 4–3 win over Gillingham, and finished 1950–51 with two goals in nine games. He hit eight goals in 21 games in 1951–52, rising to prominence in the latter half of the season under the tutelage of Freddie Steele. He hit 14 goals in 47 games in 1952–53, as the "Valiants" finished second in the Third Division North, one point behind Oldham Athletic.
He played in every match of the club's 1953–54 FA Cup run, although he missed the semi-final defeat to West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park due to injury. He bagged a hat-trick in a 6–0 demolition of Rochdale on 28 November 1953, striking 16 goals in 36 league games in 1953–54, as Vale won the Third Division North title by an eleven point margin. He hit two goals past Tottenham Hotspur of the First Division in front of a crowd of 50,684 at White Hart Lane in the Fourth Round of the FA Cup in 1954–55, though Vale lost the game 4–2. Griffiths went on to finish the season with seven goals in 33 games.
He suffered a decline in form after a cartilage operation at the start of the 1955–56 season, though scored a hat-trick past Plymouth Argyle in a 3–1 home win on 25 February. He also scored past Potteries derby rivals Stoke City in a 1–1 draw at the Victoria Ground on 31 March 1956, and finished the season with seven goals in 21 appearances. He scored just once in 17 games in 1956–57, as Vale were relegated in last place of the Second Division, despite an upturn in form brought around by the arrival of new manager Norman Low. He played just three times in 1957–58, and was sold to Mansfield Town for a four-figure fee in January 1958.
Mansfield finished sixth in the Third Division North in 1957–58, and 20th in the Third Division in 1958–59, one place and five points above the relegation zone. He later played non-league football for Stafford Rangers, Wellington Town, Sankeys, Macclesfield Town, Northwich Victoria, Nantwich Town and Wolstanton United. He also became a player-coach of Michelin, player-assistant manager at Parkway, coach of Birches Head Hotel and then manager of the Staffordshire F.A. team.
Style of play.
Former teammate Roy Sproson said that: "he was quick and had the ability to put the ball in the net" and was "highly regarded by his fellow players" despite being an "underrated player by the Vale public".

Age of Empires (video game)

Age of Empires (often abbreviated to AoE) is a history-based real-time strategy video game released in 1997. Developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Ensemble was still an independent company, later acquired by Microsoft. The game uses the Genie, a 2D sprite-based game engine. The game allows the user to act as the leader of an ancient civilization by advancing it through four ages (the Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron Ages), gaining access to new and improved units with each advance. It was later ported to Pocket PCs with Windows, resulting in a version very similar to the PC game.
Originally touted as "Civilization" meets "Warcraft", some reviewers felt that the game failed to live up to these expectations when it was released. Despite this, it received generally good reviews, and the expansion pack "" was released in 1998. Both the original "Age of Empires" and the expansion pack were later released as "The Gold Edition".
Gameplay.
"Age of Empires" requires the player to develop a civilization from a handful of hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.
Twelve civilizations are available. Each with individual sets of attributes, including a varying number of available technologies and units. Each civilization has technologies unique to them, so that no civilization possesses all the technologies possible within the game.
A major component of the game is the advancement through four ages. These are the Stone Age (Mesolithic/Nomad/Paleolithic), the Tool Age (Neolithic/Chalcolithic), the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Advancement between ages is researched at the Town Center, and each advancement brings the player new technologies, weapons, and units.
Modes.
The game features four single-player campaigns in which the player is required to complete specific objectives. Campaigns are a collection of scenarios which are completed in a linear fashion. The campaigns follow the history of the Egyptian, Greek, Babylonian and Yamato civilizations; there's also a complete campaign specially made for the demo version that takes place in the Hittite Empire. Aside from the campaigns, there is a game mode called "random map", in which a different map is generated for each new game. Variations of random map, such as the resource-heavy "death match", are also available.
"Age of Empires" also facilitated online and network play with up to 8 people simultaneously. Because the network play is less sophisticated than that of modern games, lag and disconnections often occur. Until 19 June 2006, multiplayer gameplay was supported by Microsoft Gaming Zone. At that point, the Zone abandoned support of most CD-ROM games, including "Age of Empires" and "".
The creation of user-made scenarios or series of scenarios (campaigns) for the game was made possible using the "Scenario Builder". This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities as a result. Ensemble Studios used the Scenario Builder to make the single-player campaigns which shipped with the retail game. Various unofficial sites exist where custom scenarios can be submitted and downloaded. In late 2005, it was discovered that by modifying various data files, units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor. Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move near it. Through data editing, the rules of unit placement can also be modified. This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units, which creates new possibilities for design. Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates, a mode to treble each unit's hitpoints, and a tool to edit map sizes.
Civilizations.
Players choose to play as one of 12 civilizations. The civilizations are sorted into four distinct architectural styles, based on East Asian, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek architecture, which determine their in-game appearance. The 12 civilizations are:
Technology.
Technology is researched at specific buildings, to which they are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations.
Technology plays a very important role in the strategy of the game. As a civilization progresses through the ages, technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult. As a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources can make the difference between victory and defeat.
Units.
Players control a variety of Civilian and Military units. Most units can be upgraded through research (e.g. faster gathering for villagers, stronger armor for military units, and longer range for archers).
Land-based units are the most prevalent in gameplay. Villagers are the most basic units in "Age of Empires". Their primary function is to collect resources, cutting down trees for wood, mining for stone and gold, and hunting, foraging, farming, or fishing to acquire food. Villagers can also construct buildings and repair both buildings and naval vessels, and are capable of engaging in hand-to-hand combat when necessary. Priests are non-combat units which can heal allied units or "convert" enemy units (in which case the target unit changes allegiance). Infantry units, such as clubmen, swordsmen, and hoplites use melee combat to attack at short range. Mounted units include chariots, cavalry, and war elephants. Archers, mounted or on foot, attack at range. Siege units are of two types: catapults and ballista. Catapults hurl stones which generate blast damage, affecting all units in a small area, and are especially effective against buildings and groups of units. The ballista is less damaging against buildings and units, but it fires faster and is cheaper than the catapult.
Nautical units often play a secondary role, but can be essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, with the amount of gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).
Unit types are identical, regardless of civilization (though certain civilizations may have improved variations of these units). So, for example, a Korean Choson broad swordsman is identical to a Persian or Phoenician one, as are bowmen, axemen, short swordsmen, cavalry, and so forth. Some armors and clothes are historically inaccurate, with the long swordsman bearing more resemblance to a Roman praetorian. Some units were also available in the game to civilizations that never, historically, had them; hoplites can be trained by every civilization except Persia, and some middle-Asian civilizations can train Legions and Centurions, while Japanese Yamato can build triremes.
Buildings.
The Town Center is one of the most important buildings in the game. Here villagers are created, and age advancement is researched. Most scenarios have each player begin with a single Town Center; the ability to build multiple Town Centers is unlocked by the construction of the Government Center during the Bronze Age. The Town Center provides population support for four units. In order to build more units, houses must be constructed. Each house supports four units, and although any number of houses can be built (a concept which was not maintained in later games like "Age of Mythology"), they can only support a maximum of fifty units.
Military units are produced at specific buildings relevant to their area. All sea units are created at the docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications ("Age of Empires" was one of the first real-time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense). Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.
Wonders are enormous monuments representing the architectural achievements of the time, such as the Egyptian Pyramids. They require huge amounts of resources to build and are constructed very slowly. Wonders can neither produce units nor conduct research. In scenarios with "Standard Victory" conditions, a player can win by constructing a wonder and keeping it from being destroyed for 2,000 years (about 10 minutes in the real world). Building a wonder also greatly increases a player's score, which is beneficial in "score" games. Players typically make it their top priority to destroy enemy wonders, especially under Standard Victory conditions. For this reason and because a wonder is relatively easy to destroy, a wonder must be well-guarded at all times.
Development.
"Age of Empires" (under the working title "Dawn of Man") was the first game developed by Ensemble Studios. Its historical setting was chosen to be more plausible and accessible, particularly to casual gamers, than existing games. At the time, other real-time strategy games had science fiction and fantasy settings, so the historical setting of "Age of Empires" enabled it to stand out. The designers received much of their inspiration from the game "Civilization", with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive. "Age of Empires" was designed by Bruce Shelley, Tony Goodman (in charge of the game's artwork), and Dave Pottinger (in charge of the game's artificial intelligence). Stephen Rippy was the music director (a role he kept through the series), with occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in "Age of Empires" using sounds from actual instruments from the periods in the game, as well as their digital samples. The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.
Reception.
Although not as acclaimed as the later games in the series, the first "Age of Empires" was generally well received by critics, and scored highly on review aggregator websites including an 8.3 out of 10 on Metacritic, an 87% on Game Rankings, an 85 out of 100 on MobyGames.
"Game Informer" ranked it the 81st best game ever made in its 100th issue in 2001. They called it a cross between "Warcraft" and "SimCity" and praised its multi-player and its popularity among gamers. Game Revolution categorized the game as "a cross between "Civilization II" and """, while GameSpot lamented that it was "a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire-builder", describing it as "Warcraft with a hint of Civilization." While "Computer Gaming World"s Elliott Chin compared the game extensively to "WarCraft II", he said that it has "great depth, and when compared to its real-time brethren, it has to be the most sophisticated of the bunch". GameVortex wanted less of a combat-oriented gameplay, but praised the modes of play, commenting that "the random map generation [...] really keeps the game spiced up." GameSpot decried the level of micromanagement necessary to control the game (which was due to absence of production queues and low AI of the player's units) calling it "a poor idea", which "seriously diminishes AOE's enjoyability." GameVortex echoed this criticism, while PC Gameworld pointed out the subsequently released patches improving some of the faulty AI programming. Elliott Chin criticized the game's population limit, which he thought to be its "most serious grievance".
While noting the similarities with "Warcraft II", PC Gameworld praised the uniqueness of each playable civilization, and noted that the "graphics are extremely detailed and have a hand-painted feel to them. It's rare to see a game this beautiful with such detailed unit movements." Game Revolution was impressed by the amount of different units of the game, and noted that the developers "obviously did research here, and the result is a well rounded, historically accurate product (at least for a game)". The soundscape of the game was also criticized, with GameVortex stating that "the oral clues just aren't enough to let you differentiate just what's going on." With a view to the future of the game, Game-Revolution emphasized the scenario editor, which "allows you total control in the design of scenarios and campaigns", a "tool at your disposal to create a scenario exactly to your liking."
The game won numerous awards, including Gamecenter's 1997 "Game of the Year" and the 1998 AIAS "Computer Strategy Game of the Year" award.

Western European paintings in Ukrainian museums

Art museums of Ukraine possess a large number of Western European paintings. There, one can see canvases by world famous artists (such as Titian, Francesco Guardi, Jusepe de Ribera, Diego Velásquez, Rubens) as well as by the painters whose works throughout the world are unique (such as Master of the Osservanza, Jacopo del Sellaio, Jacob Ferdinand Voet, Georges de La Tour and others).
Before the year 1917.
The museum collections of Western European paintings formed in different ways. Usually they were based on private collections. The collectors often sold or presented pictures they owned to other owners; sometimes (mostly after the 1905 Russian Revolution) large collections were sold abroad.
A number of Ukrainian people of art spoke out against the export of the artistic wealth and strove for its preservation in public museums and galleries. As early as in the middle of the 19th century, in Ukraine there existed private museums and ‘cabinets of fine arts’ in the universities of Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa. It was due to the public efforts that the first Ukrainian public museum was opened in 1886 in Kharkov, and the municipal art gallery – in 1907 in Lvov. Both had large sections of Western European paintings. Some educated people paid their own money to acquire artistic objects which they wanted to donate to their native cities. In such a manner, I. Betsky and A. Alfyorov, graduates of Kharkov University, started the collection of Western European paintings at the local museum. In Kiev, it was Bogdan and Varvara Khanenko who in the 1870s began collecting works by Western European artists.
Between the October Revolution and the Great Patriotic War.
After the October Revolution, all artistic values located in Ukraine were nationalised and distributed to museums and art galleries, both to the existing and to the newly formed ones. 
But the new rulers kept selling works of art abroad. Besides, Ukrainian museum pieces were being exchanged for far less valuable ones from Russian museums. For example, against Varvara Khanenko’s will, the Bolsheviks split the collection of Kiev Museum. Some pieces were sold to the USA for little money that was to be spent on military equipment and arms. Varvara’s will was violated once again after her death when the mention of the Khanenkos disappeared from the name of the museum. After that, it was for a long time called Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art.
In 1925-1926, the museum was enriched with Shchavinsky’s collection of the 17th century pictures by Flemish and Dutch artists.
In 1919, Zhitomir Local History Museum was created. Its art gallery was based on the Chaudoirs’ collection with a number of first-rate canvases by Western European painters.
The works from the stock of Odessa Committee for the Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity and the ones from the metropolitan museums formed Odessa Art Museum. It was opened in 1920. Its present name is Odessa State Museum of Western and Eastern Art.
In November 1920, the Crimea having become Soviet, the regional section for the protection of monuments of art and antiquity started work effecting the order of the Crimean Revolutionary Committee. The section was to expropriate and inventory the art treasures from the palaces and mansions of the Crimean South Coast. In December, the objects expropriated formed the basis of Yalta Popular Artistic Museum where Western European authors prevailed. In 1927, Yalta Museum's collection was transferred to the newly created Sevastopol Art Museum. The same year, the museum in Sevastopol received Simferopol Art Museum’s entire collection of Western European art that included a lot of valuable Flemish and Dutch paintings.
After the annexation of Western Ukraine to the USSR in 1939, Lviv Art Gallery was enriched with nationalised private collections containing plenty of wonderful works by Western Europeans.
During the Great Patriotic War.
On June 29, 1941, most pieces from Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art started being evacuated to Penza and Saratov. But it appeared impossible to move the whole collection. When the Germans came, they started plundering the collection, a process that was put the brakes on for some time only by Dietrich Roskamp who was the keeper of the museum at that time. He protested against the misappropriation of the artistic objects and moving the collection to Germany. But it was hardly possible to fully stop it, and in 1943, due to the Red Army’s advance, the invaders organised the exportation of the collection to Germany. They did it methodically at first, listing and carefully packing the objects, and later hastily and chaotically. Altogether, the Nazi took 474 pictures, 10 sculptures and about 25,000 prints from the museum. Luckily, a few valuable works had managed to be hidden, among them Perugino’s "Archangel" and Marco Palmezzano’s "Madonna with a Saint".
225 works of art were plundered from Lviv Art Gallery during the German invasion, many of them were destroyed. Among them was the unique collection of Dürer’s paintings.
In Kharkov Art Museum, only five thousand pieces survived.
Before the war, the collection of Poltava Art Museum numbered about 30,000 pieces. The exposition failed to be evacuated and was almost all destroyed. Among the losses was the priceless Western European collection with unique works by Giambattista Tiepolo, Rubens, Melchior d'Hondecoeter, Adriaen van Ostade, Vigée-LeBrun and others.
The major part of the objects from Sevastopol Art Gallery was evacuated and preserved by its director Mikhail Kroshitsky. After the war, the works of art from Sevastopol Gallery were on display in Simferopol for some time, because Sevastopol lay in ruins and the house of the museum had been burnt down.
Only eleven objects of all the pre-war treasures survived in the Art Museum in Donetsk (at that period the name of the city was Stalino).
After World War II.
Kiev and Odessa have the largest collections that exist as independent museums of western and eastern (oriental) art. The Western European collection in Lvov, though as rich and valuable as those in Odessa and Kiev, is but a department of the local art gallery. Sections containing a lot of valuable works by Western Europeans exist in art museums of Kharkov, Sevastopol, and in Zhitomir Local History Museum. A number of wonderful canvases by foreign artists are possessed by the museums of Poltava, Sumy, Lutsk, Uzhgorod.

Ring bolt

A ring bolt is a bolt with a captive ring on one end and threads on the other end. The ring bolt differs from the eye bolt in that in the former the ring is articulated, such that it can rotate in at least one axis, and can thus reduce bending forces on the bolt when loaded and will present the minimum obstruction when "flat". 
Ring bolts are commonly used to attach cables or ropes to objects, for example securing a boat to a dock, or as a tie down point for cargo.

This is a list of Nunavut territorial electoral districts. In total there are 22 electoral districts in Nunavut spread over three administrative regions. Each district elects one member to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut in a first past the post system. Unlike some other parts of Canada, such as Ontario, a new by-election must be held in a riding if the original result ended in a tie. There are no political parties in Nunavut, each candidate runs as an independent and the territory operates by consensus government.

Inclusive Management

Inclusive Management is a pattern of practices by public managers that facilitate the inclusion of public employees, experts, the public, and politicians in collaboratively addressing public problems or concerns of public interest.
Definition.
The management component of the compound idea of inclusive management signifies that inclusion is a managed, ongoing project rather than an attainable state. The inclusion component means something different from the commonplace use of inclusion and exclusion to reference the socioeconomic diversity of the participants. The understanding of inclusion in this analysis emphasizes diversity in terms of the necessity of a diversity of perspectives to promote civic discovery in a deliberative setting. Inclusion involves active boundary spanning across differences in perspectives, institutions, issues, and time, which may or may not be founded upon work to integrate socioeconomically diverse participants.
The inclusion part of the idea is perhaps best encapsulated by the “50/50 rule,” a term used by public managers in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to invoke a variety of meanings. Sometimes “50/50” means that process and outcome are equally important, in other words that the effects of a process on community building are as important as the task completion. Sometimes it means that ideally 50% of the people involved in a process have participated in prior, related processes and 50% are newcomers, such that each policy-making effort acknowledges past conversations or decisions yet remains open to new ideas that may alter the previous consensus. From the perspective of the 50/50 rule, things like process and outcome or task and community are not in a trade-off relationship, and indeed are not even separable In this context, concluding that participation was done “for the sake of participation” rather than to effect the outcome would be a damning critique. Keeping process and outcome, newcomers and old-timers, and past and present in play are ways of creating connections across individuals, groups, interests, and issues. Tasks are accomplished, yet opportunities continue to be open for revising as well as for moving on to the other issues and tasks that emerge or are next in line. This sense of inclusion is part of an ongoing stream of issues and people involved in one process or concern rolling forward into another echoes theorizations of democracy and civic engagement as an ongoing inquiry and never-finished project.
Relationships with Other Public Management and Policy-Making Ideas.
Inclusive public management is a newly characterized form of public management following the more traditional forms of public administration, espoused by Woodrow Wilson and political scientists including Frank Goodnow and Charles A. Beard. Analyses of inclusive public management contribute to a stream of practice and research regarding New Public Management popularized by Osborne and Gaebler, particularly recent contributions on reconceptualizing members of the public as partners or coproducers of public services rather than as "customers" of government. Inclusive public management describes some practices of participatory democracy, sharing with deliberative democracy an emphasis on participants making decisions through deliberative processes rather than the mere aggregation of individual interests through voting or other mechanisms, the idea being that through deliberative processes that enable communicative rationality and civic discovery, new understandings and resources of public value or the public good may be realized. It intersects with other fields of research and practice on collaborative governance that describe collaborative processes for making and implementing public policy and urban or regional planning Inclusive management also aligns with recent writings on network governance to the extent that they focus upon cross-boundary collaborations within networks.
Distinguishing Inclusion and Participation.
Inclusive management practices are one way to enact public participation and civic engagement, which may be implemented in a variety of ways. Inclusive management practices are not the same as citizen participation or as inclusion as the latter term is typically used in democratic theory to denote the involvement of ethnically or socioeconomically diverse persons or groups in a decision-making process. Instead, inclusive management theories make a distinction between inclusive practices and participatory practices, which are intersecting dimensions of any civic engagement process. Inclusion is not a term for describing participation that has been done particularly well. Indeed, participation may be done well or badly, as may inclusion. Rather, inclusion and participation are two different approaches to public engagement, with different implications for the roles of the parties involved, the kinds of decisions reached, and the kind of community fostered by engagement. A process may be characterized by one, neither, or both, along two intersecting dimensions of low to high inclusion "and" low to high participation. The following table identifies the features of high participation and high inclusion 
Diversity and representation.
Quick and Feldman’s distinction between inclusion and participation addresses the place of diversity in civic engagement. One potential source of confusion is that the inclusion component of the term inclusive management means something different from the commonplace use of inclusion to refer to the socioeconomic diversity of participants and adequacy of representation or the proportional representativeness of participation in an engagement process. Given the everyday use of the term, characterizing a process that has not had socioeconomically diverse participation as “inclusive” is confusing and may be misread as being dismissive of diversity. Diversity certainly does have a place in inclusive practices. Within the framework of distinguishing inclusion and participation, however, it is not an either/or proposition to decide whether a diverse process is or is not inclusive or participatory. Nor can diversity be assigned to the dimension of inclusion or participation. Instead, diversity can be engaged through participation- or inclusion-oriented strategies, but it has different meanings in these two orientations.
Inclusion in Terms of Boundaries.
Inclusion involves transcending dichotomies or engaging boundaries. Dichotomies or boundaries − such as government/non-government, expert/local, internal/external, process/outcome, flexibility/accountability, participation/control, and the temporal or issue scope of a problem − are distinctions that inclusive managers often bring into play.
Broader social theory about the relationship of structure and agency, such as structuration, practice theory, and actor-network theory, or regarding the nature of boundary-work and boundary objects, communities of practice, and the narrative construction of reality, are powerful instruments for analysis in showing the interdependent relations between these dichotomies and clarifying how actions that transcend these dichotomies may be enacted.
Examples of Inclusive Management Practices.
Prior research has identified several inclusive practices, including:
To date, researchers have identified inclusive public management practices in communities that have a longstanding commitment to engaging the public, on an ongoing basis, in addressing public concerns together. This research has focused primarily on building public potential to address public problems at the local level of government in the United States. Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Charlotte, North Carolina are cities where inclusive practices have been documented. However, inclusive management practices might be found at any level of government or in any location.

Thomas Bainbrigg

Thomas Bainbrigg (Bainbridge) (died 1646) was an English college head.
Life.
A northerner, he was possibly from Kirkby Lonsdale. He graduated B.A. at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1597, M.A. in 1600. He became Master of Christ's in 1622, and was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1627.
He was Master in John Milton's student days at Christ's. Bainbrigg was not a strong partisan on religious issues, but supported George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in his contest with Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire in 1627 for the position of Chancellor. He spoke up for Isaac Dorislaus, accused as a republican. A funeral sermon by Bainbrigg, on 16 October 1620, had an awakening effect on Thomas Goodwin, who was to become an important Puritan figure.
Bainbrigg was a benefactor to his college, which prospered under his leadership. Student numbers climbed, and the Civil War times had little adverse effect, with Bainbrigg, known not to be against the Puritans, left in place.

Eric Schmitt

Eric S. Schmitt (born June 20, 1975) is a Republican member of the Missouri Senate, representing the 15th senate district since 2009. He previously served as an Alderman for Glendale, Missouri from 2005 to 2008.
Early life and education.
Born in Bridgeton, Missouri, Schmitt is a lifelong resident of St. Louis County. He graduated from DeSmet Jesuit High School in 1993 and from Truman State University in 1997, where he earned a B.A. "cum laude" in political science.
At Truman, Schmitt was a member of the Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity, played football and baseball, and was a founding member of Truman’s Habitat for Humanity chapter. He received a scholarship to attend St. Louis University School of Law, where he earned his J.D. in 2000. Schmitt was an editor of the law review and published an article analyzing the Supreme Court decision in "Clinton v. New York".
Personal life and legal career.
Schmitt was admitted to the Missouri bar in 2000. He is a partner at the firm Lathrop & Gage, LLP, in Clayton, Missouri, where he focuses on land use, real estate, business disputes, and administrative appeals. In his community, he has been an active member of the boards for DeSmet Jesuit High School, Nurses for Newborns Foundation, St. Louis Crisis Nursery, and a Parents as Teachers Program. He had previously been elected chairman of the Young Lawyer Section Council of the Missouri Bar, led a statewide Giving Tree effort to benefit Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and created a Special Needs Advocacy Task Force. He has also been involved with the TS (Tuberous Sclerosis) Alliance, the Gateway Chapter of the Autism Society of America, Habitat for Humanity, and local Chambers of Commerce.
Political career.
Schmitt served as an alderman for Glendale, Missouri, from 2005 to 2008. On November 4, 2008, Schmitt was elected to the Missouri Senate. When sworn in, Schmitt became one of the youngest member ever to serve in the state's upper chamber. He represents the 15th senatorial district, which includes all or parts of Affton, Shrewsbury, Grantwood Village, Webster Groves, Glendale, Warson Woods, Oakland, Crestwood, Kirkwood, Valley Park, Fenton, Twin Oaks, Manchester, and Ballwin.
Schmitt's priorities include economic development, increasing access to affordable and portable healthcare, promoting government transparency, and ensuring quality education for all Missouri students. In his first year in office, Schmitt successfully pushed legislation that established the MO HealthNet (Medicaid) Data Transparency Program, which created a web portal allowing all Missourians to see what providers charge for their services with just a click of a mouse. Schmitt also sponsored and passed a state constitutional amendment to make the St. Louis County Assessor an elected position so that voters have a more accountable and transparent property assessment process. The amendment was overwhelmingly approved by St. Louis County and Missouri voters in November 2010. Schmitt further advocated for government transparency by successfully pushing legislation to give taxpayers greater online access to more information about their property reassessments. He also sponsored a bill to require additional notice to the public before local governments can vote on tax increases, eminent domain, tax increment financing, or certain projects receiving public funding.
In 2009, the Missouri House of Representatives failed to pass a Senate-approved bill regarding autism insurance reform. In response, Schmitt helped to organize a series of statewide public awareness events and rallies, building a grassroots effort to push for reform.
During the 2010 session, both chambers approved autism insurance reform with large bipartisan majorities. Beginning in 2011, Schmitt became a member of Senate Leadership when his colleagues elected him as Majority Caucus Secretary. He also assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Jobs, Economic Development, and Local Government. That year, he passed a bill phasing out Missouri's franchise tax, which was an outdated double taxation on business assets. When fully phased in, the elimination of the franchise tax will represent the largest tax relief measure in the state's history. He dedicated himself to defending fair and equitable funding for schools in his district.
Following the 2010 census, Schmitt's district was redrawn, although it is still centered around south central St. Louis County. On February 28, 2012, Schmitt filed for reelection in the 15th district. He will run unopposed in both the primary and general elections in 2012.
Committee Membership.
Schmitt serves on the following legislative committees and statewide commissions:
Legislative Awards and Other Honors.
Schmitt has won numerous awards for his service, including:

List of wind farms in Romania

As of 2012, there was an installed capacity of 1,905 megawatts (MW) of wind power in Romania, up from the 7 MW installed capacity in 2007.
Until December 2010, Romania added around 440 MW to its installed wind capacity from two wind farms: Fântânele-Cogealac and the EDP Peştera. The Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm has been completed in 2012 and at the time was the largest in Europe.
Romania has a wind-power potential of around 14,000 MW, and an energy-generating capacity of 23 terawatt-hours. The country's wind power capacity that can be assimilated by the national transport grid is between 3,000 MW and 9,000 MW, while only in the last two years the total power of the requests for connecting to it was about 22.800 MW. The Dobruja region, which consists of Constanţa and Tulcea counties, has the second-highest wind potential in Europe.
Several companies are interested in investing in wind farms in Romania. The Italian company Enel Green Power, a subsidiary of Enel, plans to build several wind farms with a total capacity of 350 MW. The Swiss conglomerate Cofra Group plans to build two large wind farms, one that will have a capacity of 700 MW in Dobrogea and one that will have a capacity of 400 MW in Neamţ and Suceava counties; the total investment will amount to $1.65 billion. In 2008, Iberdrola bought 50 wind farm projects, with a combined installed capacity 1,600 MW, from two companies for $450 million.
Romanian companies interested in building wind farms include Electrica and Green Energy, which have plans to build wind farms that will have an installed capacity of 310 MW with total investments of $420 million. The Hungarian company Sinus Holding will build five wind farms in the Northern Moldavia region, having an installed capacity of 700 MW and totaling $800 million in capital investment, that will be built by December 2009.
Largest projects.
These are the most important wind farm projects in Romania ("larger than 10 MW"):

Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol

The Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol is a proposed protocol complementary to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) being championed by the Mayors for Peace 2020 Vision Campaign and gathering the support of local authorities and civil society actors all over the world. It seeks to challenge national governments to follow through on the commitments they made in Article VI the Treaty. In this Article, the parties undertake to pursue "negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament", and towards a "Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control". The Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol calls on the States Parties to the Treaty to live up to this "good faith" agreement. It challenges them to adopt an overarching approach to nuclear disarmament, rather than the go-nowhere-slowly step-by-step approach. It challenges the nuclear-weapon states to show good faith through unilateral reciprocal actions. Furthermore, it challenges the States Parties to adopt a legal-binding document, rather than the past political-pledges ignored or undermined by some of the nuclear-weapon States Parties in the past.
Support for the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol.
The Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol is an important initiative, which is rapidly gaining momentum as cities around the world express their strong support for it. In June 2008, the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) unanimously adopted a far-reaching resolution entitled “Support for the Elimination of All Nuclear Weapons by the Year 2020.” The USCM resolution recommends that the U.S. government “urgently consider” the Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol as a means of “fulfilling the promise of the NPT by the year 2020, thereby meeting the obligation founded by the International Court of Justice in 1996 to ‘conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.’” The resolution also encourages USCM members to sign the Cities Appeal being circulated in support of the Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol and to encourage other elected officials in their cities to do likewise.
The Cities Appeal.
Since May 2008, the main focus of the work of the 2020 Vision Campaign has been the signature drive for the Cities Appeal in support of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol.
By signing the Cities Appeal, Mayors and elected local officials around the world are given the chance to get behind the Hiroshima–Nagasaki Protocol ahead of the formal and final presentation of the results of the international signature drive at the 2010 NPT Review Conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
As of February 2009, the number of signatories stands at 516 from 42 countries. They range from Sapporo (Japan) to San Francisco (USA), and from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Cape Town (South Africa) as far as Toronto (Canada). Of these, 468 are mayoral signatures, each representing the solidarity of their own city or municipality with the cause of nuclear disarmament.
Article I.
Article I calls for a “clampdown” on all weapon-usable fissile materials – be they in weapons, reactors, or stocks – accompanied by a cessation of nuclear weapons acquisition and of all preparations for the use of nuclear weapons.
Article II.
Article II calls for establishment of a negotiating forum open to all states, with the sole purpose of developing a Nuclear Weapons Convention or Framework Agreement for achieving nuclear disarmament in all its aspects by the year 2020.
Article III.
Article III underscores the need for all states to contribute to the international control system and to continue to comply fully with their NPT obligations.

Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal

The burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal was an important event in pre-Confederation Canadian history and occurred on the night of April 25, 1849, in Montreal Quebec. It is considered a crucial moment in the development of the Canadian democratic tradition, largely as a consequence of how the matter was dealt with by then co-prime ministers of the united Province of Canada, Sir Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin. The St. Anne's Market building lodging the Legislative Council and Assembly of Canada was burned down by Loyalist rioters in retaliation for the Rebellion Losses Bill while the members of the Legislative Assembly were sitting in session. The episode is characterized by divisions in pre-Confederation Canadian society concerning whether Canada was the North American appendage of the British Empire or a nascent, sovereign nation. In 1837 and 1838 Canadians rebelled against the oligarchic rule of the British colonial administration, first in Lower Canada, then in Upper Canada (or the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario respectively. Political reforms followed the rebellions as Canada was of vital strategic interest to the British Empire; simply put the British could not afford to lose the rest of North America, especially given the inconsequential results of the War of 1812, and they acquiesced to what gradually evolved into full legal national sovereignty. Many key leaders of the Rebellions would play focal roles in the development of the political and philosophical foundations for an independent Canada, something achieved on July 1, 1867. Opposition to this movement was principally represented by the somewhat aristocratic British colonial administration and their extended community, in addition to organized fraternal associations, such as the Scotch-Irish Orange Order and the Anglo-Montreal Bourgeoisie of the era. The Rebellion Losses Bill was intended to both offer amnesty to former rebels (permitting them to return to Canada) and an indemnity to individuals who had suffered financial losses as a consequence of the rebellions. Though the bill was passed by the majority of those sitting in the Legislative Assembly, it remained unpopular with the Loyalist population of Montreal, who decided to use violence to demonstrate their opposition. As such, the Parliament was destroyed amidst considerable mob violence, and an invaluable collection of historical records kept in the parliamentary library lost forever.
Despite the tense situation and deplorable socio-cultural crime committed by the mob, Lafontaine proceeded cautiously, fought off armed thugs who had shot through his window, and maintained restraint and resolve in his actions. Jailed members of the mob were released on bail soon after their arrest and a force of special constables established to keep the peace. Though there was public concern this might be a crushing blow to the reform movement, Lafontaine persevered despite the opposition, and would continue in his role developing the tenets of Canadian federalism - peace, order and good government. Within a decade public opinion had shifted overwhelmingly in the development of a sovereign Canada.
Parliament moved to Montreal.
The Province of Canada (or United Canada) was born out of the legislative union of the provinces of Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec) in February 1841. In 1844, its capital was moved from Kingston, in Canada West (formerly Upper Canada), to Montreal, in Canada East (formerly Lower Canada). St. Anne's Market, located where Place d'Youville stands today, was renovated by architect John Ostell to host the provincial parliament. As part of the moving of the capital, all books in the two parliamentary libraries, as well as those of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council were transported by boat on the St. Lawrence.
General elections were held in October 1844. The Tory party won a majority and Governor Metcalfe had its principal spokesmen enter the Executive Council. The first session of the second parliament opened on November 28 of the same year.
Economic crisis.
In 1843, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the "Canadian Corn Act", which favoured Canada's exports of wheat and flour on the UK markets through the reduction of duties. The protectionist policy of Lord Stanley and Benjamin Disraeli, in continuity with Great Britain's colonial practice during the first half of the 19th century, was overturned in 1846, by the repeal of the "Corn Laws" and the promotion of free trade by the government of Robert Peel.
Canada's chambers of commerce feared an imminent disaster. The "Anti-Corn Law League" was triumphant, but the commercial class and ruling class of Canada, principally English-speaking and conservative, experienced an important setback. The repercussions of the repeal were felt as early as 1847. The Canadian government put pressure on Colonial Secretary Earl Grey to have Great Britain negotiate a lowering of the duties imposed on Canadian products entering the United States market, which had become the only lucrative path to export. A reciprocity treaty was ultimately negotiated, but only eight years later in 1854. During the interval, Canada experienced an important political crisis and influential members of society openly discussed three alternatives to the political status quo: annexation to the United States, the federation of the colonies and territories of British North America, and the independence of Canada. Two citizens' associations appeared in the wake of the crisis: the Annexation Association and the British American League.
After 1847, the fears of the chambers of commerce in Canada were confirmed, and bankruptcies kept accumulating. Property values were in freefall in the cities, particularly in the capital. In February 1849, the introduction in Parliament of an indemnity bill only aggravated the discontent of a part of the population who had watched "d'un mauvais œil" the passing of a series of legislative measures by the reformist majority, which took power in beginning of 1848, about a year before.
Rebellion Losses Bill.
In 1845, the Draper-Viger government set up, on November 24, a commission of inquiry into the claims the inhabitants of Lower Canada had sent since 1838, to determine those that were justified and provide an estimate of the amount to be paid. The five commissioners, Joseph Dionne, P. H. Moore, Jacques Viger, John Simpson and Joseph-Ubalde Beaudry, submitted their first report on April 1846. They received instructions from the government to distinguish between claims made by persons participating in the "rebellion" and those who had given no support to the insurrectionist party. The total of the claims considered receivable amounted to £241,965, 10 s. and 5d., but the commissioners were of opinion that following a more thorough enquiry into the claims they were unable to make, the amount to be paid by the government would likely not go beyond £100,000. The Assembly passed a motion on June 9, 1846 authorizing a compensation of £9,986 for claims studied prior to the presentation of the report. Nothing further was accomplished on this question until the dissolution of parliament on December 6, 1847.
The general election of January 1848 changed the composition of the House of Assembly in favour of the opposition party, the moderate reformists led by Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. The new governor, Lord Elgin, who arrived in the colony on January 30, first formed a government that did not have the support of the majority of the members in the House. These withdrew their support of the Executive by a vote of no-confidence on March 3. On March 7, governor Elgin called in Baldwin and Lafontaine, respectively leaders of the majority parties in both sections of the united province, to the Executive Council. On March 11, eleven new ministers For Canada East: James Leslie (president of the Executive Council), Thomas Cushing Aylwin (Solicitor General), Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine (co-premier and attorney general), René-Édouard Caron (president of the Legislative Council), Louis-Michel Viger (receiver general) et Étienne-Paschal Taché (commissioner of public works) </ref> entered the Council.
On January 29, 1849, Lafontaine moved to form a committee of the whole House on February 9 to "take into consideration the necessity of establishing the amount of Losses incurred by certain inhabitants in Lower Canada during the political troubles of 1837 and 1838, and of providing for the payment thereof". The consideration of this motion was pushed ahead on several occasions. The opposition party, which denounced the desire of the government to "pay the rebels", showed itself reluctant to begin the study of the question which was on hold since 1838. Its members proposed various amendments to Lafontaine's motion: a first, on February 13, to report the vote by ten days "to give time for the expression of the feelings of the country"; a second one, on February 20, declaring that the House had "no authority to entertain any such proposition" since the Governor General had not recommended that the House "make provision for liquidating the claims for Losses incurred by the Rebellions in Lower Canada, during the present session". The amendments were rejected and the committee was eventually formed on Tuesday, February 20, but the House was adjourned.
The debates that took place between February 13 and 20 were particularly intense and, in the House, the verbal violence of the representatives soon yielded to physical violence. Tory MPPs Henry Sherwood, Allan MacNab and Prince attacked the legitimacy of the proposed measure because according to them it rewarded the "rebels" of yesterday and constituted an insult to the "loyal" subjects who had fought against them in 1837 and 1838. On February 15, executive councillors Francis Hincks and William Hume Blake retorted in the same tone and Blake even went as far as claiming the Tories to be the true rebels, because, he said, it was they who had violated the principles of the British constitution and caused the civil war of 1837–38. Mr. Blake refused to apologize after his speech, and a mêlée burst out among the spectators standing on the galleries. The speaker of the House had them expelled and a confrontation between MacNab and Blake was avoided by the intervention of the Sergeant at Arms.
The English-language press of the capital ("The Gazette", "Courier", "Herald", "Transcript", "Witness", "Punch") participated in the movement of opposition to the indemnification measure. A single daily, the "Pilot", owned by cabinet member Francis Hinks, supported the government. In the French-language press ("La Minerve", "L'Avenir"), the measure was unanimously supported.
On February 17, the leading Tory MPPs held a public meeting to protest against the measure. George Moffatt was elected chairman and various public men such as Allan MacNab, Prince, Gugy, Macdonald, Molson, Rose and others gave speeches. The meeting prepared a petition to the governor asking him to dissolve the parliament and call new elections, or to reserve the assent of the bill for the Queen's pleasure, that is to say, to defer the question to the UK Parliament. The press reported that Lafontaine was burned in effigy that night.
On February 22, Henry John Boulton, MPP for Norfolk, introduced an amendment that all persons having pled guilty or having been found to be guilty of high treason should not receive compensation from the government. The government party supported the amendment, but the gesture had no effect on the opposition, which persisted in denouncing the measure as amounting to "paying the rebels". Certain liberal MPPs, including Louis-Joseph Papineau and Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau, opposed the amendment because, according to them, it resulted in the recognition, by the government, of the legality of the military court created by former acting governor John Colborne in order to speedily execute the prisoners of 1839.
On March 9, the Legislative Assembly passed the bill by a vote of 47 to 18. MPPs from the former Upper Canada voted in favour, 17 to 14, while those of the former Lower Canada voted 30 to 4 in favour. Six days later, the Legislative Council approved the project 20 to 14. The project having passed both Houses of the Provincial Parliament, the next step was the assent of Governor Elgin, which came 41 days later, on April 25, 1849.
On March 22, a crowd paraded in the streets of Toronto with effigies of William Lyon Mackenzie, Robert Baldwin, and William Hume Blake. When the group neared Baldwin's residence, and in front of that of a Mr. McIntosh on Yonge Street, where Mackenzie was residing after his return from exile, they set the effigies on fire and threw rocks through the windows of Mr. McIntosh's house.

On April 25, the cabinet sent Francis Hinks to The Monklands, the governor's residence, to request that Governor Elgin quickly come to town in order to assent a new tariff bill. The first European ship of the year had already arrived in the Port of Quebec and the new law needed to be in force in order to tax its merchandise. The governor left his residence and went to the Parliament the same day.
At about 5:00 pm, the governor gave the royal assent to the bill in the Legislative Council room, in the presence of members of both houses of Parliament. Since he was already in town, the governor decided to also give assent to some forty one other bills passed by the houses and awaiting to be assented. Among those bills was the "Rebellion Losses Bill". The assent of this law seemed to take some people by surprise, and the galleries where some visitors were standing became agitated.
When the governor exited the building at around 6:00 pm, he found a crowd of protesters blocking his path. Some of the protesters began throwing eggs and rocks at him and his aides and he was forced to climb back into his carriage in haste and return to Monklands at gallop speed, while some of his assailants pursued him in the streets.
Not long after the attacks on the governor, alarm bells sounded throughout town to alert the population. A horse-drawn carriage traveled through the streets to announce a public meeting to denounce the governor's assent to the "Rebellion Losses Bill". The editor in chief of "The Gazette", James Moir Ferres, published an "Extra" which contained a report of the incident involving Lord Elgin, and invited the "Anglo-Saxons" of Montreal to attend a mass meeting to be held at 8:00 pm on Place d'Armes. The "Extra" read:
Between 1,200 and 1,500 were reported to have attended the meeting (which in the end took place on Champ-de-Mars) to hear, by the gleam of torch light, the speeches of orators protesting vigorously against Lord Elgin's assent to the bill. Among the speakers were George Moffat, Colonel Gugy and other members of the official opposition. During the meeting it was proposed to address a petition to Her Majesty asking her to recall governor Elgin and disavow the indemnification act. In the 1887 account he gave of his participation to the events, some 38 years later, Alfred Perry, the captain of a volunteer corps of firemen, asserted that on that night he stepped on the hustings to speak to the crowd, put his hat on the torch lighting the petition, and exclaimed: "The time for petitions is over, but if the men who are present here are serious, let them follow me to the Parliament Buildings."
The crowd then followed him to the Parliament Buildings, breaking the windows of the offices of the "Montreal Pilot", then the only English-language daily then supporting the administration, which were on the route to the Parliament.
When they arrived on site, the rioters broke the windows of the House of Assembly, which was still in session despite the late hour. A committee of the whole House was at that time debating a "Bill to Establish a Court having jurisdiction in Appeals and Criminal matters for Lower Canada". The last entry in the journal of the House on April 25 reads:
After breaking the windows and the gas lamps on the outside, a group entered the building and committed various acts of vandalism. According to Perry's account, he, together with Augustus Howard and Alexander Courtney, broke into the building after a first unsuccessful attempt to open the locked doors. Someone ordered a fire truck brought over, and then Perry and a notary, John H. Isaacson, used the truck's 35-foot ladder as a battering ram to break down the doors. He entered with a few followers and reached the House of Assembly. A certain O'Connor attempted to block their entry, but Perry knocked him down with the handle of the axe he was carrying. The mob took control of the room despite the resistance of a few MPPs (John Sandfield Macdonald, William Hume Blake, Thomas Aylwin, John Price) and sergeant at arms Chrisholm.
One of the rioters sat in the Speaker's chair where Morin had been sitting only a few minutes before, and declared the dissolution of the House. The room was turned upside down while other men entered the room of the Legislative Council. The acts of vandalism that were reported included the destruction of the seats and desks, stamping on the portrait of Louis-Joseph Papineau, that had been hanging on the wall next to that of Queen Victoria. Perry claimed to have set fire to the room himself when he hit the gas chandelier suspended on the ceiling with a brick, aiming for the clock that was directly above the Speaker's chair. The clock, whose ticking apparently got on his nerves, was, according to his account, showing 9:40 pm when it happened. Other sources, including newspapers of the time, believed the fire to have been started when rioters outside the building started throwing the torches that some of them had carried from the Champ-de-Mars meeting.
Since gas pipes were broken both inside and outside the building, the fire spread rapidly. Perry and Courtney ran out of the building with the ceremonial mace of the House of Assembly which was lying on the clerk's desk in front of the Speaker's chair. The mace was afterwards brought to Allan MacNab who was then at Donegana Hotel.
The St. Anne's Market building burned very rapidly, with the fire propagating to adjacent buildings, including a house, some warehouses, and the general hospital of the Grey Nuns. The mob did not allow firefighters to fight the flames devastating the parliament buildings, but did not intervene against those who were trying to save the other structures.
Damages.
The St. Anne's Market building was completely devastated. The fire consumed the parliament's two libraries, parts of the archives of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, as well as more recent public documents. Over 23,000 volumes, forming the collections of the two parliamentary libraries, were lost. Only about 200 books, along with the portrait of Queen Victoria, were saved, thanks to James Curran. Four people, Colonel Wiley, a Scotsman named McGillivray, an employee of the parliament, and the uncle of Todd, who was responsible for the libraries, and Sandford Fleming, who later became a renowned engineer, saved the portrait of Queen Victoria hanging in the hall leading to the lower house. The canvas of the painting without the frame was transported to the Donegana Hotel. The market buildings and all it contained were insured for £12,000; the insurers refused to pay because of the criminal origin of the fire.
The two libraries and the public archives had been kept in the Parliament buildings since 1845. At the beginning of the session of 1849, the library of the Legislative Assembly counted more than 14,000 volumes and that of the Legislative Council more than 8,000. The collections were those of the libraries of the old provincial parliaments of Lower Canada and Upper Canada, which were merged into a single parliament through the "Act of Union" in 1840. The parliament house of the province of Upper Canada, founded in 1791 and seated in York, had been burned down by the American army during the War of 1812. The parliament remained itinerant between 1814 and 1829, and a permanent building did not re-open before 1832. Consequently, its libraries were not considerable and only provided a few hundreds of books to the new united legislature. Most of the books came from the Parliament of Lower Canada's libraries, particularly that of the Legislative Assembly, which comprised many thousands of books and was opened to the public in 1825. The losses were estimated at over $400,000 CAD.
Looking to rebuild the parliamentary library, the government sent bibliographer Georges-Barthélemi Faribault to Europe, where he spent £4,400 purchasing volumes in Paris and London. About two years after its partial reconstruction, the library of the Parliament of United Canada was lost again to a fire, on February 1, 1854. This time, the flames destroyed half the 17,000 volumes of the library, which had been in the new Parliament Buildings of Quebec City since 1853.
The parliamentary agenda was obviously affected by the events of April 25. The day after the fire, a special meeting of the members of the Legislative Assembly was convened to meet at 10:00 am in the hall of the Bonsecours Market, under the protection of British soldiers. On that day, the MPPs accomplished nothing other than appointing a committee responsible to report on the bills that were destroyed. Their report was presented to the House a week later on May 2. Lafontaine was not present that morning, because he assisted to the wedding of lawyer Amable Berthelot, his associate in law, who was marrying the adoptive daughter of judge Elzéar Bédard. The Legislative Assembly kept meeting at Bonsecours Market until May 7, after which date the parliament was convened in a building owned by Moses Judas Hayes on Place Dalhousie.
The Legislative Council's first meeting after the fire was held in the sacristy of the Trinity Church on April 30.
First series of arrests.
Four of the speakers of the Champs-de-Mars meeting, James Moir Ferres, editor in chief and principal owner of "The Montreal Gazette", William Gordon Mack, lawyer and secretary of the British American League, Hugh E. Montgomerie, trader, Augustus Heward, trader and courtier, as well as Alfred Perry, five persons in total, were arrested and charged with arson early in the morning of April 26 by the police superintendent William Ermatinger. A crowd gathered around the police station at the Bonsecours Market in protest. Perry, who was arrested last, was transferred to the prison of the faubourg de Québec at 12:00 pm, escorted by a company of soldiers, and pursued by the crowd. Once in prison, he was put in the same cell with the other four.
Lafontaine, exercising his role as Attorney General, advised Ermatinger to release the prisoners. On Saturday April 28, they were released on bail. A procession of omnibuses and cabs transported them in triumph from the prison to the front door of the Bank of Montreal, on Place d'Armes, where they addressed their partisans and thanked them for their support.
Continuation of violence until May.
On the night of April 26, a group of men vandalized the residences of reformist MPPs Hinks, Wilson and Benjamin Holmes at Beaver Hall. The men then proceeded to the house of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, on rue de l'Aqueduc in the faubourg Saint-Antoine, vandalizing it and setting his stable on fire. The fire propagated to his house, however no one was inside at the time. The fire was extinguished by a detachment of soldiers, but not before it had caused significant damage to Lafontaine's private library. Returning toward downtown Montreal, the men broke windows on the boarding house where Baldwin and Price resided as well as those of McNamee's Inn, two buildings forming the corner of the Catholic Cemetery street. They also attacked the residences of Solicitor General Mr. Drummond on Craig street and that of Dr. Wolfred Nelson, at the corner of Saint-Laurent and Petite Saint-Jacques.
A group of Tory leaders including George Moffatt and Gugy convened a new public meeting of the "Friends of Peace" on Champ-de-Mars on Friday April 27 at 12:00 pm. There they tried to calm their followers down and proposed the resumption of peaceable means to resolve the crisis. It was resolved to submit a petition praying the Queen to relieve Elgin from office and disavow the "Rebellion Losses Act".
Confronted with riots threatening the lives of citizens and damaging their properties, the government took the decision to raise a special police force. On the morning of April 27, the authorities informed the population that men who would show up at 6:00 pm in front of the dépôt de l'ordonnance on rue du Bord-de-l'Eau would receive arms. Some 800 men, principally Canadians from Montreal and its suburbs and some Irish immigrants of Griffintown, presented themselves and between 500 to 600 constables were armed and barracked near the Bonsecours Market. During the arms distribution, a group of men showed up and attacked the new constables by firing on them and throwing rocks at them. The newly armed men fought back and wounded three of their assailants.
During a public meeting on Place du Castor on that night, general Charles Stephen Gore stepped on the hustings and dispersed the crowd by swearing on his honour that the new constables would be disarmed by morning. This is indeed what occurred, as the new force supposed to act under the orders of Montreal's justices of the peace was demobilized less than 24 hours after being armed.
A part of the 71st regiment equipped with two cannons was mobilized to repel a group of armed men marching toward the Bonsecours Market. The soldiers blocked rue Notre-Dame near the Jacques Cartier Market. Colonel Gugy intervened and dissuaded the rioters from attacking the Bonsecours Market.
On Saturday April 28, the representatives present at the Bonsecours Market appointed a special committee to prepare an address to the governor by which the Legislative Assembly deplored the acts of violence of the past three days, especially the burning of the Parliament Buildings, and gave its full support to the governor to enforce the law and restore public peace. The representatives voted for the address 36 to 16.
While not necessarily supportive of the acts of violence shaking the town of Montreal, the conservative circles of British Canada publicly expressed their contempt for the representative of the Crown. The members of the Thistle Society met and voted to strike Governor Elgin's name from the list of benefactors. On April 28, the Saint Andrew's Society also struck him from its list of members.
On Sunday April 29, the day of the Christian Sabbath, the town of Montreal was at rest and no incidents were reported.
On Monday April 30, the governor and his dragoon escort left his suburban residence of Monklands for the Government House, then lodging in the Château Ramezay on rue Notre-Dame in downtown Montreal, to publicly receive, at 3:00 pm, the address of the House of Assembly voted on the 28th. When the governor entered rue Notre-Dame toward 14:30 pm, a crowd of protesters threw rocks and eggs and other projectiles against his carriage and the armed escort protecting him. He was hooted at by some, applauded by others along the way. The representatives, also protected by an armed escort, arrived at the meeting with the governor in the Bonsecours Market by way of the ruelle Saint-Claude.
After the ceremony for the presentation of the address, the governor and his escort returned to Monklands by taking rue St-Denis in order to avoid conflict with the crowd still demonstrating against his presence. The stratagem did not work and the governor and his guards were intercepted at the corner of Saint-Laurent and Sherbrooke by rioters who again pelted them with rocks. The brother of the governor, colonel Bruce, was seriously injured by a rock that hit his head; Ermatinger and captain Jones were also injured.
On that day, Elgin wrote to Colonial Secretary Earl Grey to suggest that if he failed "to recover that position of dignified neutrality between contending parties" that he had strived to maintain, that it might be in the interest of the metropolitan government to replace him with someone who would not be personally obnoxious to an important part of Canada's population. Earl Grey, to the contrary, believed that his replacement would be harmful and would have the effect of encouraging those who violently and illegally opposed the authority of his government, which continued to receive the full support of the Westminster cabinet.
On May 10, a delegation of citizens from Toronto, who had come to Montreal to deliver an address in support of the Earl of Elgin, were attacked while in the Hôtel Têtu.
Case before Westminster.
The Tories sent Allan MacNab and Cayley to London in early May to bring their petitions to the Imperial Parliament and lobby their case with the Colonial Office. The government party delegated Francis Hinks, who left Montreal on May 14, to represent the point of view of the governor, his Executive Council, and the majority of the members in both Houses of Parliament.
The former colonial secretary, William Ewart Gladstone, of the Tory Party, sided with the Canadian opposition and exercised all his influence in its favour. On June 14, John Charles Herries, a Tory member of the House of Commons for Stamford, presented a motion to disavow the "Rebellion Losses Act" assented by the Earl of Elgin on April 25. But the governor of British North America received the support of both John Russell, the Whig Prime Minister as well as the Tory leader of the opposition Robert Peel. On June 16, the House of Commons rejected Herries' motion by a majority of 141 votes.
On June 19, Lord Brougham introduced a motion in the House of Lords to suspend the "Rebellion Losses Act" until it is amended to insure that no person who participated to the rebellion against the established government be compensated. The motion was defeated 99 to 96.
Second series of arrests.
On the morning of August 15, John Orr, Robert Cooke, John Nier, Jr., John Ewing and Alexander Courtney were charged with arson and arrested by justices McCord, Wetherall and Ermatinger. All were released on bail except for Courtney. The transfer of the accused from the Court House to the prison was a repeat of Perry's transfer on April 26. A crowd, determined to deliver up Courtney, attacked the military escort protecting his car, but were pushed back at the points of bayonets.
A gathering formed at dusk (after 8:00 pm), in front of the Orr Hotel, on rue Notre-Dame. Men endeavoured to raise barricades of three to four feet in height using the paving stones of the Saint-Gabriel and Notre-Dame streets. The authorities were informed of what was going on and a detachment of the 23rd regiment was sent to undo the work before the barricades could be armed. Some of the men who ran off when the army showed up regrouped and decided to attack the houses of Lafontaine and the boarding house where Baldwin was residing.
At around 10:00 pm, some 200 men attacked the residence of Lafontaine, who was at home and without a guard. It was around 5:00 pm when he learned of a rumour circulating in town saying that his house was going to be attacked. At around 6 or 7:00 pm, he sent a note to captain Wetherall to tell him about the rumour. Around the same time, some friends who had heard the rumour arrived on their own to help him defend his life and his property. Among them were Étienne-Paschal Taché, C.-J. Coursol, Joseph Beaudry, Moïse Brossard, and Harkin. Guns were fired on both sides. The attackers retreated with seven wounded, including William Mason, the son of a blacksmith living on Craig street, who died of his wounds the following morning. The cavalry commanded by captain Sweeney which Wetherall had sent to protect Lafontaine arrived later and missed the entire action.
The Tory press gave great coverage of the death of Mason, and, on the August 18, a grand funeral procession marched on Craig, Bonsecours and Saint-Paul street, as well as on Place Jacques-Cartier, before going toward the English cemetery.
An enquiry of the circumstances of Mason's death was opened by coroners Jones and Coursol. Lafontaine was called in to testify before the jury in the Cyrus Hotel, on Place Jacques Cartier, on August 20 at 10:00 am. While the co-premier was inside the hotel, some men spread oil in the front staircase and set it on fire. The building was evacuated and Lafontaine exited under the protection of the military guards.
Capital moves to Toronto.
On May 9, Sherwood, MPPs for Toronto, proposed to move the capital alternatively to Toronto or Quebec City. After a debate in which other cities were thrown in, Sherwood's proposal to relocate to Toronto was approved 34 to 29. On May 30, the provincial parliament was prorogued until August 9 by general William Rowan in place of governor Elgin who no longer wanted to leave Monklands. A proclamation by the governor announced the move on November 14. The Parliament stayed prorogued until it reconvened in Toronto on May 14, 1850.
Unlike Montreal, Toronto was a homogeneous town at the linguistic level; English was the common language of all main ethnic and religious groups inhabiting it. By comparison, the Montreal of the time of governor Metcalfe (1843–45) counted 27,908 Canadians, the majority French-speaking, and 15,668 immigrants from the British Isles. The statistics were similar when looking at the whole county of Montreal. In 1857 Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the new capital.

China–Holy See relations

There have been no official People's Republic of China – Holy See relations since 1951.
The Beijing government broke off diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1951 after a complicated incident. Throughout 1950 and 1951, China had been putting pressure on the Vatican by threatening a breakaway of "independent Catholics", but many priests opposed the movement, and Zhou Enlai sought a middle ground. A deadly controversy was then manufactured: a priest working at the Holy See internunciature (legation) had thrown out an old 1930s-era mortar in a trash pile out of his home. A businessman named Antonio Riva discovered the mortar and took a non-functioning piece of it back to his house to display as an antique. When Communist officials saw Riva's curio in his home, they arrested him for conspiracy to assassinate Mao Zedong, which Riva denied. Riva was executed and the Holy See's diplomatic mission was banished from the country for "espionage". Tarcisio Martina, the regional apostolic prefect, was sentenced to life in prison and died in 1961, while four other "conspirators" were given shorter sentences.
The Beijing government has set two conditions for reestablishing the relations: that the Holy See "not interfere in religious matters in China" and that, in line with Beijing's One-China policy, it break the ties with the Taipei government that it established after the expulsion of Archbishop Riberi, ties that, since the United Nations' recognition of the Beijing government as the government of China, it now maintains only at the level of chargé d'affaires. The Holy See has indicated that it would have no difficulty about the second condition, but requires discussion about the concrete meaning of the first. The main point of contention concerns the appointing of Catholic bishops in mainland China, who are now named by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, at some periods in agreement with the Holy See, at other times in direct opposition to its declared wishes. The PRC government's position is that bishops should be appointed by itself; the Holy See's position is that bishops can only be appointed by the Pope, while envisaging in some cases a form of consultation with the civil authorities.
The Holy See made efforts in 2007 to create formal ties with the PRC. High-ranking bishops in the Roman Catholic Church have implied that such a diplomatic move was possible, predicated on the PRC granting more freedom of religion and interfering less in the hierarchy of the church in mainland China.
In September 2007, the appointment of Father Joseph Li Shan by the PRC authorities was said to be "tacitly approved" by the Vatican. In May 2008, the China Philharmonic Orchestra from mainland China performed a concert for the Pope inside the Vatican, prompting analysts to speak of a "growing rapprochement" between the two countries.
The relationship between the Catholic Church and the PRC remains tense, with vocal and influential critics inside the church such as Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, Bishop emeritus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong.
Press Release.
On Thursday, April 26, 2012, the Holy See Press Office released a statement on the current state of affairs between China and the Vatican. What follows are the first few paragraphs of that statement in its English translation, and a link to it,:
"The Commission which Pope Benedict XVI established in 2007 to study questions of major importance regarding the life of the Catholic Church in China met in the Vatican for the fifth time from 23 to 25 April.
With deep spiritual closeness to all brothers and sisters in the faith living in China, the Commission recognized the gifts of fidelity and dedication which the Lord has given to his Church throughout the past year.
The participants examined the theme of the formation of the lay faithful, in view also of the "Year of Faith" which the Holy Father has announced will be held from 11 October 2012 to 24 November 2013. The words of the Gospel, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favour with God and man" (Lk 2:52), set out the task to which the Catholic lay faithful in China are called.
In the first place, they must enter ever more deeply into the life of the Church, nourished by doctrine, conscious of their being part of the Catholic Church, and consistent with the requirements of life in Christ, which necessitates hearing the word of God with faith. From this perspective, a profound knowledge of the Catechism of the Catholic Church will be a particularly important aid for them.
In the second place, lay Catholics are called to take part in civic life and in the world of work, offering their own contribution with full responsibility: by loving life and respecting it from conception until natural death; by loving the family, promoting values which are also proper to traditional Chinese culture; by loving their country as honest citizens concerned for the common good. As an ancient Chinese sage put it, "the way of great learning consists in illustrating noble virtues, in renewing and staying close to people, and in reaching the supreme good."
Thirdly, the lay faithful in China must grow in grace before God and men, by nourishing and perfecting their own spiritual life as active members of the parish community and by involving themselves in the apostolate, also with the help of associations and Church movements which foster their ongoing formation.
In this regard, the Commission noted with joy that the proclamation of the Gospel by Catholic communities, which are sometimes poor and without material resources, encourages many adults to request baptism every year. It was thus emphasized that the Dioceses in China should promote a serious catechumenate, adopt the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, and care for their formation after Baptism as well." ..."

VBS.tv

VBS.tv was an online television network owned by the "Vice" media conglomerate, and later absorbed into VICE.com. The network produced original, short-form, documentary-style video content under the auspice of VICE Films. Subject matter included humanitarian issues, music, insider travel guides, and news. The creative director of the network was Spike Jonze.
History.
Formation.
VBS began as a deal between Viacom-owned MTV Networks and Logo Group. In March 2007, the network was formed; MTV funded the formation of the network, and Vice magazine would supply the content. MTV has rights to distribute VBS content across its worldwide network of channels. According to "Vice" co-founder Suroosh Alvi, "traditional journalism always aspires to objectivity, and since day one with the magazine we never believed in that...Our ethos is subjectivity with real substantiation. I don't think you see that on CNN."
Circulation.
VBS videos are available via the network's website, as well as being broadcast on MTV Latin America and MTV2. VBS is currently featured as a weekly show on MTV2. Online circulation reached over 2.5 million hits in 2008. VBS.tv content has appeared in CNN as part of their CNN presents lineup, with CNN stating that "... We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers." Much of it is now available at VICE.com.
Content.
The network's videos feature reporting on popular culture, travel, extreme sports, and music. The site has also produced special-interest and current affairs-based shows such as an interview with Hezbollah's self-proclaimed mayor of Beirut and a show that explored allegations of environmental abuse. It has also approached drug issues, producing a documentary about the criminal use of the drug scopolamine in Colombia. Other coverage includes a series of short documentaries about Darfur, Hurricane Katrina, Liberia, and North Korea. The network also produced "Heavy Metal in Baghdad", a feature length documentary film about Acrassicauda.

Titanoboa

Titanoboa, ; meaning "titanic boa," is an extinct genus of snake that lived approximately 60–58 million years ago, during the Paleocene epoch, a 10-million-year period immediately following the dinosaur extinction event. The only known species is "Titanoboa cerrejonensis", the largest, longest, and heaviest snake ever discovered, which supplanted the previous record holder, "Gigantophis".
Size.
By comparing the sizes and shapes of its fossilized vertebrae to those of extant snakes, researchers estimated that the largest individuals of "T. cerrejonensis" found had a total length of around and weighed about .
Location.
In 2009, the fossils of 28 individual "T. cerrejonensis" were found in the Cerrejón Formation of the coal mines of Cerrejón in La Guajira, Colombia. Prior to this discovery, few fossils of Paleocene-epoch vertebrates had been found in ancient tropical environments of South America. The snake was discovered on an expedition by a team of international scientists led by Jonathan Bloch, a University of Florida vertebrate paleontologist, and Carlos Jaramillo, a paleobotanist from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.
Climate.
Because snakes are ectothermic, the discovery implies that the tropics, the creature's habitat must have been warmer than previously thought, averaging approximately . The warmer climate of the Earth during the time of "T. cerrejonensis" allowed cold-blooded snakes to attain much larger sizes than modern snakes. Today, larger ectothermic animals are found in the tropics, where it is hottest, and smaller ones are found farther from the equator.
However, several researchers disagreed with the above estimate. For example, a 2009 study in the journal Nature applying the mathematical model used in the above study to an ancient lizard fossil from temperate Australia predicts that lizards currently living in tropical areas should be capable of reaching 33 feet, which is obviously not the case. 
In another critique published in the same journal, Mark Denny, a specialist in biomechanics, noted that the snake was so large and was producing so much metabolic heat that the ambient temperature must have been four to six degrees cooler than the current estimate, or the snake would have overheated.
In popular culture.
In 2011, Charlie Brinson and his team created a electromechanical, robotic reincarnation of the "Titanoboa" snake, using twenty high-strength aluminum vertebrae and forty proportional hydraulic cylinders. There are plans to extend it to the full length.
On 22 March 2012, a full-scale-model replica of a , "Titanoboa" was displayed in Grand Central Station in New York City. It was a promotion for a TV show on the Smithsonian Channel called "Titanoboa: Monster Snake" which aired 1 April 2012.

His follow-up, "Hello! I'm Tommy Reilly", was released less than a year later on 14 June 2010.
Orange unsignedAct.
Reilly entered the television talent show "Orange unsignedAct" after hearing that his friends entered the competition themselves. After the first round in the open auditions, Reilly was picked out, however he flew from Glasgow to the auditions and made it through with four 'yes's from the judges. Reilly almost did not make it to the first auditions. Jo Whiley at first decided at the open auditions he did not have enough experience, but later re-thought her decision. After that slight hiccup, Reilly carried on, impressing Amanda Ghost. This led to him receiving a place on the Unsigned act tour, winning over judges Lauren Laverne, Simon Gavin and Blur bassist Alex James.
Reilly then went to win the competition via public vote with Hip Parade coming second and Scarlet Harlots coming third place. Reilly received a £60,000 advance, a recording contract with Universal Music, a single release, an album deal and a multi-media marketing campaign.
"Words On The Floor".
After winning Orange UnsignedAct, Reilly released his debut single, "Gimme A Call", which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart.
Soon after he began recording his debut album, "Words On The Floor", which was released on 3 August 2009. The album proved commercially unsuccessful, and only managed to reach number 79 in the UK Albums Chart.
Reilly headlined the T Break Stage at 2009's T in the Park, and appeared on the main stage of Lovebox Festival 2009 in Victoria Park, London. Soon after, he toured the UK in support of the album.
"Hello! I'm Tommy Reilly".
Shortly after the release of "Words On The Floor" A&M ended Reilly's recording contract, soon after this he signed with Euphonios and recording began on the follow up to Tommy's debut release. The second studio album, titled "Hello! I'm Tommy Reilly", was produced by Roddy Hart who supported Reilly on the "Words On The Floor" Tour.
The album, "Hello! I'm Tommy Reilly", was released on 14 June 2010 with the first single taken from the album, "Take Me Away For the Night" released the week before on 7 June. To promote the new album ahead of its release, Reilly went on tour in the UK supporting Justin Currie and The Proclaimers throughout May and June 2010. Following this Reilly announced that he would tour again, this time as the headline act throughout September 2010.
Waking A Sleepwalker.
On 23 April 2012, Reilly started a PledgeMusic project with the aim to raise funds to enable him to record and independently release his third studio album. On 26 July 2012 the project had reached 100% of its target and had been completely funded by fans' pledges. The album was release to pledgers on 24 July titled Waking A Sleepwalker.

Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and Parsonage

Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and Parsonage is a historic Presbyterian church located at 100 West Franklin Street at Cathedral Street, northwest corner in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The church is a rectangular Tudor Gothic building dedicated in 1847, with an addition in 1865. The front features two 60 foot flanking octagonal towers are also crenelated and have louvered belfry openings and stained glass Gothic-arched windows. The parsonage has walls of brick, heavy Tudor-Gothic window hoods, and battlements atop the roof and was built in 1857. This church was incorporated in 1844 by a group of men from the First Presbyterian Church then located at the northwest corner of East Fayette Street and North Street (now Guilford Avenue) in downtown (later relocated in 1854 to West Madison Street and Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood after selling their previous third church building of 1790-95 to the Federal Government which built a U.S. Courthouse there 1889, replaced again 1932 dedicated in 1860 by President James Buchanan). They felt the need for a new church in that fast-growing northern section of the city formerly "Howard's Woods" of Col. John Eager Howard's (Revolutionary War commander of the famed "Maryland Line" regiment of the Continental Army) country estate "Belvedere" (mansion located at intersection of North Calvert and East Chase Streets, razed 1875) where the Washington Monument was erected with its four surrounding park squares just two blocks from their new building. Franklin Street Church was also located on "Cathedral Hill" in the southern part of the community bordering downtown and across the street from the old Baltimore Cathedral (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) erected 1806-1821 and designed by Benjamin Latrobe. Later in 1882-1886, philanthropist Enoch Pratt founded his central library for the new Enoch Pratt Free Library then facing West Mulberry Street at Cathedral, a block south which was replaced in 1931-33 by a new central library building encompassing the entire block and now directly across Franklin Street from the F.S.P.C. In 1973, the two historic congregations reunited to form The First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and was centered at the First Church site on West Madison and Park. The Franklin Street building was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist independent Protestant congregation and later re-sold to the present "New Unity Church Ministries". Across Cathedral Street to the northeast was the 1820s era Greek Revival home designed by Robert Mills (who also did the Washington Monument two blocks away) which later was occupied by the original Maryland Club, an exclusive Southern-leaning dining and leisure society of gentlemen, founded 1857 that was once threatened by Massachusetts Militia Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, U.S.A. when he occupied Baltimore at the beginning of the Civil War on May 13, 1861, and fortified Federal Hill with a Fort and cannons overlooking the harbor and city, "to put a shot into it" if he spied a reputed rebel flag flying or any discontent to declared martial law. The Club later moved to North Charles and East Eager Streets in 1892 and mansion was later replaced by the former Central Building of the Young Men's Christian Association of Central Maryland (YMCA) which was closed in the 1980s and the building renovated as the Mount Vernon Hotel and Cafe.
The church is no longer used by a Presbyterian congregation. John Gresham Machen, the founder of Westminster Seminary attended the church as a child.
The church and parsonage were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 5, 1971. They are included within the Cathedral Hill Historic District and the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

Jackson v Royal Bank of Scotland

Jackson v Royal Bank of Scotland [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050127/jack-1.htm UKHL 3 is an English contract law case, which concerns remoteness of damage.
Facts.
Mr James Jackson was a partner with Barrie Stewart Davies (by the time, passed on), trading under the name "Samson Lancastrian". They imported dog chews from Thailand and sold them to a firm called "Economy Bag". They both had the same bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland. By mistake, RBS sent Economy Bag a document showing that Jackson was making a 19% markup on every transaction. Feeling cheated, they cancelled the business relationship with Jackson and Davies. Jackson sued RBS for the loss of the opportunity to make further profits.
At first instance, Jackson won, since the relationship would have continued for four more years on a decreasing scale, and after then further dealings would just be speculative.
The Court of Appeal held that damages should be limited to one year of the breach, and all other losses were too remote. Jackson appealed, arguing that one year was based on an error of principle, and in fact RBS's liability was open ended. RBS argued that no loss at all was foreseeable, because it was not within its reasonable contemplation that accidental disclosure would lead to the relationship being terminated.
Judgment.
The House of Lords held that the loss of future orders was not too remote, and that Jackson had an obvious commercial interest in retaining confidential information. The point of damages for breach of contract with RBS, to which Jackson was entitled, was to put him in the position as if there had been no breach.
On the issue of remoteness, the judge's assessment was a good one, in that it was increasingly likely as time passed that Economy Bag would want to squeeze Jackson's profit margins. To avoid further cost, that award (four years) would be restored.
Lord Walker made some interesting observations on the rule in "Hadley v Baxendale".

The institute hopes to bring in scientists from Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a level I trauma center which is the largest teaching hospital affiliated with the Harvard University Medical School.
The Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute was officially established in February 2009 at MGH, MIT and Harvard with a dual mission: to contribute to the accelerated discovery of an HIV/AIDS vaccine and subsequently to establish itself as a world leader in the collaborative study of immunology. Founded with a commitment of $100 million from the Ragons, the institute is structured and positioned to significantly contribute to a global effort to successfully develop an HIV/AIDS vaccine through: 
The Ragon Institute’s scientific leadership comprises a diverse group of world class immunologists, geneticists, infectious disease specialists and computational and systems biologists from the MGH, MIT, Harvard, the Broad Institute, Harvard-affiliated hospitals in Boston and from other leading institutions housing satellite collaborators around the country. The fusion of expertise represented in this partnership is unique in the HIV/AIDS research effort. Collectively and individually it is expected to bring out the best in each institution's and each investigator’s research.
The Institute will be housed initially within the MGH. Once fully established, it is expected to occupy its own building and function as a catalyst for collaboration across these institutions. From the outset the Ragon Institute will create a singular opportunity and environment to engage scientists, engineers and clinicians in challenging research for which there may be no greater benefit – saving lives and curing the ill.

Konterra.
In 1981, Gould and other members of his family purchased of gravel pits straddling I-95 near Laurel, Maryland. The following year, Gould proposed building a model mixed-use community named Konterra at the site. Gould broke ground in 1991 on three speculative buildings in Konterra.
The development stalled due to a lack of transportation infrastructure at the site. Gould asked Maryland state and local officials to build an off-ramp from I-95 to the planned community, extend the Metro's Green Line to the site, and build Maryland Route 200 (the "Intercounty Connector") through the community. Gould had been a steady financial backer of Parris Glendening, a Democrat who was elected Governor of Maryland in 1994.
But when the Glendening administration refused to approve the Intercounty Connector, Gould threw his backing behind Republican challenger Robert Ehrlich, who was elected in 2002. Although Maryland law limits donations to state candidates for office to just $4,000 per election cycle, the law does not prevent a business person from making donations through corporations they own. Using this loophole, Gould gave Ehrlich $50,500 between 1999 and 2006, $21,000 Ehrlich's running mate Michael Steele, and $163,100 to Maryland Republican candidates for state and federal office. During the same period, he gave just $750 to Martin O'Malley, mayor of Baltimore (who was elected governor in 2006). Gould declined to comment on the donations for the "Washington Post", and Ehrlich defended them by noting that his wife was a long-time friend of Gould's sister-in-law. Ehrlich admitted that he met with Gould about Konterra several times.
On July 12, 2005, Ehrlich approved construction of the $2.4 billion, Intercounty Connector.
In October 2007, Gould Property said Konterra would be a $3 billion development containing luxury homes, townhouses, and condominiums; a business district; and central entertainment, office, and retail space. The project's two phases, Konterra and Konterra Town Center, would break ground in 2009. The Prince George's County Planning Board approved preliminary designs and plans for Konterra Town Center East in August 2008. These plans laid out 4,500 residential units and of office and retail space. Prince George's officials said that more detailed plans would be considered in the fall of 2009, with an eye toward breaking ground in late 2009 or early 2010, and completion of the community within 12 to 20 years.
Other notable projects.
In 1989, CSX Transportation proposed removing the Georgetown Branch railroad track line and using the property to build several large, luxury homes. The line ran through the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historic Park, and when it came up for sale the National Park Service was unable to obtain a congressional authorization to purchase the land. Gould loaned the agency $12 million to hold the land for a year, at which time the federal money came through. The land now forms part of the Capital Crescent Trail.
In 1990, Gould partnered with Boston Properties to construct Market Square, a development in the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site which was completed in 1997.
In 1996, Gould's Laurel Sand and Gravel company which includes Fairfax Materials, Allegany Aggregates, Laurel Asphalt and S.W. Barrick & Sons purchased the 600 acres chase property north of the historic town of Savage, Maryland. The site is home to the Savage Stone quarry, mining Baltimore Gabbro for road bed construction. The facility started operations in 2005 after special zoning approval with a 25 year reserve in materials.
Gould then partnered with his brother, Caleb Gould, and local developers David Costello and Richard B. Talkin to form Kincade LLC. In September 2000, Kincade broke ground on the $11 million Columbia Lakeside, a six story, office building facing Lake Kittamaqundi. It was the first new office building in Columbia Town Center since 1998.
In 2001, Gould embarked on a six-year-long land swap deal with the District of Columbia. Gould owned a lot on the southeast corner of 9th Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW. Gould joined with Marriott International, a hotel company, to propose that a 1,500-room hotel be built on this site to function as a "headquarters hotel" for the Walter E. Washington Convention Center (then under construction). Gould hired the law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi to assist with his plans. There was extensive debate among city officials and developers over whether the Gould parcel was too small for the hotel, and whether the old Washington Convention Center site (a few blocks away) would be more appropriate. D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams appointed Gould to an advisory board in October 2004, and charged the advisory board with studying all proposed sites and recommending one for the hotel to the city. In August 2005, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority put a $900,000 down payment on two lots (which included the historic former headquarters of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry adjacent to the Gould parcel. On January 26, 2005, Gould swapped his parcel on 9th Street NW for a similar-sized lot at the site of the old convention center. With the land swap, the city was able to move ahead with plans to build the Washington Marriott Marquis, the 1,430-room "headquarters hotel" long-desired by the city. On November 1, 2007, the deal to swap land with Gould was finally approved. Although the City Council had signed off on the deal in June 2005, the city took another 25 months to change local zoning regulations so that Gould was exempted from building housing on his new site. Gould said he still had not decided what should be built there.
In 2003, Gould partnered with local residents in Baltimore to purchased the MacGillivray building at Charles and Read Streets to keep it out of the hands of a competing developer. Gould and the others hoped to renovate the structure into a mixed-used apartment building with upscale retail space on the ground floor.
In April 2007, Gould proposed a major redevelopment of an area bounded by Massachusetts Avenue NW, I Street NW, 6th Street NW, and 7th Street NW (a trapezoidal city block just southeast of Mount Vernon Square). Although 650 Massachusetts Avenue NW and 901 Seventh Street NW were modern office buildings on the western end of the parcel, surface parking lots and several historic townhouses facing I Street NW occupied the remainder of the block. Gould proposed construction of an 11-story, office building with retail space on the ground floor and 300 underground parking spaces on the area currently occupied by the parking lots and townhouses. The office building's facade would be decorated with Chinese motifs, in keeping with the nature of the nearby Chinatown neighborhood. He proposed moving 621 I Street NW and 623 I Street NW (both constructed in 1852 and never renovated) to form a cluster with three other historic townhouses on the southeast corner of the parcel, and demolishing 627 I Street NW (which had been renovated as recently as 1946 and was no longer considered to have retained its historic character). The District of Columbia Historic Preservation Review Board began reviewing his proposal.
Gould took several steps to help win local support for his proposal. He worked with the Chinatown Steering Committee and the Chinatown Revitalization Council, and offered to contribute $1 million toward the construction of affordable housing in Chinatown, to turn over of space in the new building for community use, contribute $100,000 to neighborhood programs, and give free parking space in his building to members of both groups. However, Gould also proposed closing part of the alley serving the block. Steering committee members opposed this, because the closed area would be behind their condominium homes and they feared an increase in crime. D.C. Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray attempted to mediate the dispute. Gould abandoned these negotiations, and his architects redesigned the office building to build a service area by reducing the community space to just . He also limited the space's use to a handful of groups he approved of. Gould also altered his community contribution plan, agreeing to donate $600,000 to the Chinese Community Church, provide rental discounts to Asian-owned retailers in the new building, and donate $850,000 to build affordable housing in Adams Morgan (a D.C. neighborhood several miles from Chinatown). Despite strong objections from the two Chinatown community groups, the D.C. City Council approved Gould's proposal by a 12-to-1 vote in August 2007.
Local roles.
In the mid-1990s, Gould was elected president of the Penn Quarter Neighborhood Association, a position he continued to hold as late as 2002.
Gould was also chairman of the Downtown Business Improvement District in Washington, D.C.

Ilpenstein

Ilpenstein (also "Het huis te Ilpendam") was the name of a ruined castle of the Free and high Lordship of Purmerend, Purmerland and Ilpendam, located in Ilpendam (Waterland) in the north of the city of Amsterdam.
History.
In the year 1618 Volkert Overlander - knight, mayor and advisor of the city of Amsterdam - bought the Lordship from the Count of Egmond. In 1622 Overlander built the castle of "Ilpenstein". After Overlanders death Frans Banning Cocq, who has married his daughter Maria, inherited his influence and properties in the north of Amsterdam with the title as "Lord of Purmerland and Ilpendam".
Since Banning Cocqs death in 1655 the castle belongs to the Amsterdam regent family De Graeff.
Joost van den Vondel wrote some brave poems about Pieter de Graeffs and Jacoba Bickers wedding in 1662 at castle Ilpenstein. Their cousin and brother-in-law Johan de Witt was also at this marriage party.
The last residents were "Christina Elisabeth de Graeff" and her husband "Jacob Gerrit van Garderen". In 1872, the castle was sold and a new building was constructed at the site.

Unisolvent functions

In mathematics, a collection of "n" functions "f"1, "f"2, ..., "f""n" is unisolvent on domain Ω if the vectors
are linearly independent for any choice of "n" distinct points "x"1, "x"2 ... "x""n" in Ω. Equivalently, the collection is unisolvent if the matrix "F" with entries "f""i"("x""j") has nonzero determinant: det("F") ≠ 0 for any choice of distinct "x""j"'s in Ω.
Unisolvent systems of functions are widely used in interpolation since they guarantee a unique solution to the interpolation problem. Polynomials are unisolvent by the unisolvence theorem
Examples:
Systems of unisolvent functions are much more common in 1 dimension than in higher dimensions. In dimension "d" = 2 and higher (Ω ⊂ R"d"), the functions "f"1, "f"2, ..., "f""n" cannot be unisolvent on Ω if there exists a single open set on which they are all continuous. To see this, consider moving points "x"1 and "x"2 along continuous paths in the open set until they have switched positions, such that "x"1 and "x"2 never intersect each other or any of the other "x""i". The determinant of the resulting system (with "x"1 and "x"2 swapped) is the negative of the determinant of the initial system. Since the functions "f""i" are continuous, the intermediate value theorem implies that some intermediate configuration has determinant zero, hence the functions cannot be unisolvent.

Michèle Rosier

Michèle Lazareff Rosier (born 3 June 1930) is a French fashion journalist and designer who founded the V de V sportswear label. In addition to this, she has worked as a film director and screenwriter since 1973.
Early life and education.
Born Michèle Lazareff in 1930, her parents were the journalists Pierre Lazareff (1907–1972) and Hélène Gordon-Lazareff (1909–1988) who between them founded "Elle " magazine. Aged 10, she was the first ever child to read "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, a close friend of her parents.
She studied at the Nightingale-Bamford School in New York.
Journalism.
Lazareff Rosier started out as a journalist for her father's daily paper, "France Soir" before becoming chief editor of the magazine "Le Nouveau Femina".
Fashion.
In the early 1960s Rosier founded "V de V" (which stands for "Vêtements de Vacance", or 'Holiday Wear'). She also designed for at least two other lines: dresses for "Chloe D'Alby", and a line of affordable furs called "Monsieur Z" which included pink and blue dyed rabbit fur coats. However, her "V de V" designs, including both fashionable sportswear and activewear such as swimwear and ski-wear, were very successful. She was noted as an early adopter of vinyl and stretch fabrics, with one New York reporter commenting in 1965 on the close similarity between her two-colour jersey dresses and Yves Saint Laurent's subsequent Mondrian dresses. Due to her love of plastics, she was nicknamed the "Vinyl Girl," and has been credited with introducing vinyl to Paris fashion before André Courrèges, to whom she was compared by the "International Herald Tribune" for her "style without nostalgia." She has also been credited with being the first designer to deliberately use outsize industrial zippers.
Rosier, herself a keen skier, produced particularly distinctive ski-wear whose streamlined design was in stark contrast to previous models. In 1966 Eugenia Sheppard proclaimed that Rosier's slimline skiwear had "defeated the old-time bulky teddy-bear look". Other suits were made in quilted nylon velvet and vivid colours with detachable face panels such as the one featured on the front cover of "Sports Illustrated" magazine for 13 November 1967. She offered helmets with rotating green-to-clear visors (designed by Monique Dofny) and her "stainless steel" and silver suits in nylon and lurex were described as "pure James Bond," and having "cosmic flair."
Rosier also designed for "White Stag" in the USA, and "Jaeger" in the UK. One of her clear PVC raincoats for "Young Jaeger" was chosen by Ernestine Carter as part of the Dress of the Year for 1966, along with a Simone Mirman hat and a "Young Jaeger" black and white dress. She designed parachute jumpsuits for Raquel Welch to wear in the 1967 film "Fathom".
In 1988, V de V was purchased by Sergio Tacchini.
Films.
Since 1973 Rosier has worked as a film director and screenwriter for French-language cinema. Her first two films "George Who?", a biography of George Sand, and "Mon coeur est rouge (Paint my Heart Red)", which deals with a female market researcher, have been described as feminist. She then produced television documentaries before returning to films with "Embrasse-moi" (1989).

The was a food supply ship of the Imperial Japanese Navy which was in service from the 1920s to the Second World War.
Construction.
The "Mamiya" was originally meant to be an oil transporter but was instead outfitted to be a food supply ship. The Navy sent her to the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Yard where she was fitted with facilities for carrying enough food for 18,000 men over three weeks, and kitchens to produce large quantities of food including yōkan, manjū, tofu, and konyaku. A number of chefs and pastry chefs were employed aboard and she became part of the Combined Fleet.
Service in Pacific War.
Already old by the outbreak of war, she continued to be part of the navy's operations in the Pacific. On 12 October 1943, she was damaged by the US Navy submarine USS "Cero" near Chichi-jima, and on 6 May 1944, was again damaged by USS "Spearfish" in the East China Sea. In both cases she was repaired and returned to service. The food supply ship was torpedoed and damaged in the South China Sea () by (). She was torpedoed again and sunk () on the 21st by .

Technetium (99mTc) tetrofosmin

Technetium (99mTc) tetrofosmin is a drug used in nuclear medicine cardiac imaging. It is sold under the brand name Myoview (GE Healthcare). The radioisotope, technetium-99m, is chelated by two 1,2-"bis"[di-(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino]ethane ligands which belong to the group of diphosphines and which are referred to as tetrofosmin.
Tc-99m tetrofosmin is rapidly taken up by myocardial tissue and reaches its maximum level in approximately 5 minutes. About 66% of the total injected dose is excreted within 48 hours after injection (40% urine, 26% feces). 
Tc-99m tetrofosmin is indicated for use in scintigraphic imaging of the myocardium under stress and rest conditions. It is used to determine areas of reversible ischemia and infarcted tissue in the heart. It is also indicated to detect changes in perfusion induced by pharmacologic stress (adenosine, lexiscan, dobutamine or persantine) in patients with coronary artery disease. Its third indication is to assess left ventricular function (ejection fraction) in patients thought to have heart disease.
No contraindications are known for use of Tc-99m tetrofosmin, but care should be taken to constantly monitor the cardiac function in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.
Patients should be encouraged to void their bladders as soon as the images are gathered, and as often as possible after the tests to decrease their radiation doses, since the majority of elimination is renal. 
The recommended dose of Tc-99m tetrofosmin is between 5 and 33 millicuries (185-1221 megabecquerels). For a two-dose stress/rest dosing, the typical dose is normally a 10 mCi dose, followed one to four hours later by a dose of 30 mCi. Imaging normally begins 15 minutes following injection.

GEICO advertising campaigns

GEICO advertising campaigns are known for using humor and satire, often featuring distinctive characters such as the company's mascot, the GEICO gecko. The advertising strategy incorporates a saturation-level amount of print (primarily mail circulars) and television parody advertisements, as well as radio advertisements. A common line used by GEICO is "15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance."
Warren Buffett, owner of GEICO parent Berkshire Hathaway, has stated that he would spend $2 billion on GEICO ads if he could, approximately double the spending in 2012, which was $1.1 billion, over twice that of second place Progressive Corporation, with 6.8% of premiums going into commercials. However, this is offset by not paying agents commissions, since GEICO uses a direct to consumer model. This has resulted in GEICO being the second largest auto insurer in the United States (behind State Farm).
Many of the most prominent TV ad campaigns, such as the GEICO Gecko, the GEICO Cavemen, the Rhetorical Questions campaign featuring Mike McGlone, Maxwell the Pig, and the GEICO Hump Day Camel were developed by The Martin Agency.
Animated advertisements.
Animated advertisements were part of the early GEICO Direct ads as well as the "Dumb Things" campaign. The 15-second long commercials, animated by Bill Plympton, featured a curious little man walking up to an object and eventually getting hurt due to his curiosity of the object. One of the commercials, for example, involved him finding a cannon and pressing a button, causing a resulting cannonball to fire out and stick to his face. The original saying in the commercial was "You could still save money on car insurance. Even if you made a few mistakes."; later modified to "We all do dumb things. Paying too much for car insurance doesn't have to be one of them."
The GEICO Gecko.
The company's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot, The Gecko, an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency, later modified to a CGI creature by Framestore CFC. The gecko first appeared in 1999 during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors. The original commercial features the Gecko, voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer, who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters "This is my final plea: I am a gecko, not to be confused with GEICO, which could save you hundreds on car insurance. So, STOP CALLING ME!", before licking his eye. Later "wrong number" ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko. In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood (which portray him as a representative of the company), the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent, because it would be unexpected, according to Martin Agency's Steve Bassett. In 2010s commercials the gecko's accent is more working-class, perhaps in an effort to further "humanize" him. "As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better, we did a few things," says Steve Bassett, creative director at The Martin Agency. "We wanted to make him a little more guy-next-door. And he looks a lot more real than he's looked before."
Maxwell the Pig.
Maxwell is an anthropomorphic talking pig and something of a recurring character in a few GEICO advertisements. Maxwell debuted in an installment of the Rhetorical Questions campaign as the "little piggy who cried 'wee wee wee' all the way home" (referencing the famous nursery rhyme "This Little Piggy") being driven home by a friend's mother, squealing along the way. While Maxwell was originally intended as a one-time character, the popularity of his debut commercial resulted in him being spun off into his own series of commercials which usually feature him as a tech-savvy, informative pig who is most concerned with his GEICO-related objects.
GEICO Cavemen.
A popular series of well-received advertisements uses cavemen as pitchmen. Also developed by the Martin Agency, the ads center on Neanderthal-like cavemen, no different from modern-day individuals (outside of the somewhat pre-historic facial features), encountering either an ad or commercial with the tagline "GEICO: so easy a caveman could do it," followed by their disgust with the supposed stereotype of caveman stupidity. The ads posit a world where cavemen are still alive and active members of society in the present day, behaving and living nothing at all like the stereotypical caveman. The main characters presented in the ads are affluent, educated, and cultured, eating at fancy restaurants, going to exclusive parties, and seeing their therapists (portrayed in the commercials by two-time Oscar-nominated actress Talia Shire). The humor revolves around the relative normality of the cavemen's presence and their reactions to the stereotype represented in the ads, and their attempts at defending themselves from the stereotype.
The ads were so successful that the commercial actors are appearing in a successful series of interactive websites written and produced by GEICO's in-house creative team at Caveman's Crib and most recently, iHeartcavemen. A spin off TV series, titled "Cavemen" and starring new actors, debuted on ABC in October 2007 to overwhelmingly negative critical reaction. It was canceled after only six episodes were aired.
Parodies.
Another common theme is misdirection, in which the commercial appears to be about an unrelated product (or, in fact, may not even be a commercial), suddenly changing to become a plug for GEICO. The commercials use a variety of fictional characters such as Speed Racer, Chatty Cathy, Jed Clampett, and Bill Dutchess. Other commercials relate to a hair loss doctor who has saved by switching to GEICO, a nature show about a fish, and a soap opera of a couple who are breaking up. Another set of GEICO ads involved a fictional reality show called "Tiny House" in which contestants were forced to live in a half-scale house.
An additional commercial theme is the promotion of fictional products. In 2006 parody ads featured such products as long distance phone service, tomato soda, fast-food, a reality TV show, dolls, and even poking fun at the Old Navy commercials - in all cases, the parody portion of the ad ends with "but it won't save you any money on car insurance." After the GEICO slogan is heard, the commercials end with "Why haven't you called GEICO?"
The parody pitch crossed over to the Caveman campaign in 2007, in a 10-second spot that appears to be a talking heads news interview, but features the popular caveman.
In response to some of the parody ads, Seth Green and Matthew Senreich wrote a sketch using the character C in a parody of one of the celebrity ads for their second "Robot Chicken" "Star Wars" special.
"MADtv" also made a sketch parodying these ads using characters of Elmo (who was performed by Frank Caeti) and Carlos Mencia (who was played by Johnny Sanchez).
Actor Scott Whyte has made a series of commercial parodies, calling the company, "Schmeiko", while performing a series of impressions.
"I've got good news".
In another ad campaign, a character would be breaking bad news to another (such as a baseball manager replacing a struggling pitcher with a reliever), but then offers helpfully, "I've got good news: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to GEICO!" That news, of course, is of no immediate use at all to the other character(s). Some of the ads were parodies and/or featured celebrities including, for example, Esteban; one featured the popular anime character Speed Racer. The exchange became parodied for a time while the ads were popular. One of the most watched "I've got good news" spots was a soap opera parody featuring television actor Sebastian Siegel.
Bland salesman.
In another series of ads, a GEICO pitchman is played by actor Jerry Lambert in an extremely bland and understated way, parodying the stereotype of an insurance man, such as reading to a group of uninterested children from a book of fairy tales about insurance. In one segment, he reads a supposed e-mail from a viewer saying it would be "da bomb" ("i.e.", something good), if the Gecko would do a dance called "The Robot". Cut to the Gecko doing that dance smoothly and gracefully (to the tune of a not-for-public-sale melody called "Sweet World" by a group called Omega Men, which was used in the arcade video game "In the Groove 2") and then back to the insurance salesman attempting to do the same dance, seemingly more stiffly than an actual robot would. The newest commercial featuring the GEICO gecko depicts the Gecko receiving a business suit from the salesman, in order to present a more professional appearance, but he declines.
Real service, real savings.
In this campaign, a real GEICO customer would present his/her testimonials, while a celebrity standing next to, or behind, the customer uses his/her signature styles to help get the customer's word across.
Some of these celebrities included
The slogan exclusive to this campaign is "GEICO: Real service, real savings".
Blueprint commercials.
GEICO also has several only blue-and-white ads, coined as "blueprint commercials", that focus on getting the point across that GEICO is "saving people money on more than just car insurance" (such as motorcycle, RV, boat, etc.), accompanied by the song "Gimme What I Want" by DCP Productions.
My Great Rides.
In 2007, GEICO also launched a social networking site, My Great Rides, for motorcycle owners. My Great Rides is a place for cycle owners to share stories about trips they have taken on their bikes, as well as post pictures of their motorcycles, and comment on other members' stories and pictures. My Great Rides was taken down on February 27, 2012. 
GEICO Racing.
The number 7 car of the NASCAR Nationwide Series is driven by Mike Wallace and was sponsored by GEICO prior to 2009. Commercials involving the race team are of a memorably disdainful young boy, played by actor Eddie Heffernan claiming to be a relative of Mike Wallace and being a better driver. The boy says, "When people see Mike Wallace and the GEICO number 7 doing well, they'll think of saving a bunch of money on car insurance. But when they see me, they'll say, 'There goes Lauren Wallace; the greatest thing to ever climb into a race car.'"
The commercials are sometimes presented in an interview fashion, where an unseen narrator speaks to the ambitious go-kart driver. "What do you think of Mike Wallace?" the child is asked, to which he responds, "Whatever, he's out there selling car insurance, I'm out there to win." When questioned on his relation to the NASCAR driver, Lauren shakes his head and concludes, "I didn't say I wouldn't go fishing with the man, all I'm saying is if he comes near me, I'll put him in the wall." To which the narrator questions him, "You don't race in the Busch Series." Lauren replies "Listen, go-kart track, grocery store, those remote controlled boats; when it comes to Mike Wallace the story ends with me putting him in the wall."
New ads in this lineup include Lauren referring to himself as being, "100 miles away and ready to strike," and "lightning in a bottle."
The success of those ads resulted in the launch of an interactive website written and produced by GEICO's in-house creative team at GEICO Garage. The site includes cameo appearances by Lauren Wallace and drivers Mike Wallace, his daughter Chrissy Wallace, Speed TV's Tommy Kendall, Paul Tracy, Christian Fittipaldi and Max Papis.

Reminiscent of the old "Stupid Things" commercials, these show videos of people doing stupid things, such as running in hallways with pillows, done YouTube style. YouTube celebrity Brandon Hardesty also appeared in one such commercial, which included a clip from one of his famous "Strange Faces" videos.
TRS: The Real Scoop.
Introduced in September, 2007, this series of ads features an "E! True Hollywood Story"-type show about famed fictional characters such as Fred Flintstone, Jed Clampett, and even a Cabbage Patch Kid named Ben Winkler claiming to have their cars (the Flintmobile, Jed's 1923 Oldsmobile truck, and a Plymouth Reliant, respectively) insured by GEICO, featuring interviews with made-up investigators (however, the Ben Winkler spot does not have an interview). These commercials were voiced over by narrator David O'Brien.
The money you could be saving.
In 2008, GEICO began airing a series of television ads featuring "the money you could be saving", in the form of two paper-banded stacks of U.S. banknotes with a pair of Googly eyes on top. In some commercials, someone discovers this character sitting nearby, and in others it simply stares at the camera while a voice-over talks about how it wants you to save money. These ads includes a remix by Mysto & Pizzi of the 1980s song "Somebody's Watching Me". During the Halloween 2009 season, GEICO tied in with HBO's "True Blood" series on bus bench ads and dressed up Kash in fang dentures.
Talking inanimate objects.
In 2009, GEICO began a series of commercials featuring talking inanimate objects doing damage to cars. So far, they have used a talking tree limb falling on a windshield and breaking it. The tree limb makes fun of the car right before a smaller limb falls on the hood.
The next one is a talking pothole with a thick southern belle accent causing a flat tire. The pothole somewhat apologizes then says she'll get her cell phone out and call a wrecker before realizing that she doesn't have one because she's a pothole.
Rhetorical Questions Campaign.
Toward the end of 2009 until early 2012, GEICO introduced another advertising campaign in which Mike McGlone walks into an empty room and queries the viewer, "Could switching to GEICO really save you 15% or more on car insurance?" After this, he pauses and then asks a rhetorical and/or obvious question which is immediately followed by a scene cut to the subject at hand.
Radio ads.
Another series of radio ads that debuted around the time of the rhetorical questions campaign air as part of two daily news factoids. One concerns business news and the other is an "on this day in history"-style piece referred to as "Today in Time." Two fifteen-second ads featuring the Gecko are played during the spots.
Short Stories and Tall Tales.
Starting in 2010, there have been TV commercials in which a nursery rhyme, being read to the audience from an illustrated book entitled "Short Stories and Tall Tales", turns into an ad for GEICO homeowner's insurance:
Xtranormal.
Near the end of 2010, a new advertising campaign began made up of amateurish computer animated advertisements, supposedly made in 15 minutes, created with the computer software program Xtranormal.
Easier Way to Save.
Starting in the summer of 2011, a new series of advertising involved people discovering unusual ways to save money.
Television commercials:
Radio commercials:
Brighter Side.
This campaign shows two people in a sticky situation. One of them is not as worried as the other, explaining "I'm looking on the bright side. I save 15% on my car insurance by switching to GEICO."
Commercials from this campaign include:
Get Happy, Get GEICO.
Starting in 2012, GEICO ran TV commercials in which bluegrass pickers named Ronny (played by director/musician Alex Harvey) and Jimmy (played by actor/comedian Timothy Ryan Cole), respectively, talk about how happy saving money on insurance can make someone, and using examples intended to be humorous:
Museum of Modern Insurance.
This campaign involves paintings in a museum talking to each other. It is also known as the "GEICO Portraits Gallery".
Did You Know?
Starting in 2013, a series of commercials was broadcast in which one person reads a GEICO "15 percent" ad and a second person says "Everybody knows that," to which the first person says, "Well, did you know..." followed by an amusing (and fictional) "fact" which is then illustrated in a cutaway scene.

Dovey Johnson Roundtree

Dovey Johnson Roundtree (born April 17, 1914) is an African-American civil rights activist, ordained minister, and attorney. Her 1955 victory before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the first bus desegregation case to be brought before the ICC resulted in the only explicit repudiation of the separate but equal doctrine in the field of interstate bus transportation by a court or federal administrative body. That case, Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company (64 MCC 769 (1955)), which Dovey Roundtree argued with her law partner and mentor Julius Winfield Robertson, was invoked by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy during the 1961 Freedom Riders' campaign in his successful battle to compel the Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce its rulings and end Jim Crow in public transportation.
Roundtree was saluted by First Lady Michelle Obama on the occasion of the release of her 2009 autobiography, "Justice Older than the Law", which Roundtree co-authored with Washington journalist Katie McCabe and which won the 2009 Letitia Woods Brown Award from the Association of Black Women Historians. In a letter made public at a July 23, 2009 tribute to Roundtree at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, the First Lady cited Roundtree's historic contributions to the law, the military and the ministry, and stated: "It is on the shoulders of people like Dovey Johnson Roundtree that we stand today, and it is with her commitment to our core ideals that we will continue moving toward a better tomorrow."
A protégé of black activist and educator Mary McLeod Bethune, Roundtree was selected by Bethune for the first class of African-American women to be trained as officers in the newly created Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later the Women's Army Corps) during World War II. In 1961 she became one of the first women to receive full ministerial status in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which had just begun ordaining women at a level beyond mere preachers in 1960. With her controversial admission to the all-white Women's Bar of the District of Columbia in 1962, she broke the color bar for minority women in the Washington legal community. In one of Washington's most sensational and widely covered murder cases, "United States v. Ray Crump", tried in the summer of 1965 on the eve of the Watts riots, Roundtree won acquittal for the black laborer accused of the murder of Georgetown socialite (and former wife of a CIA officer) Mary Pinchot Meyer, a woman with romantic ties to President John F. Kennedy.
The founding partner of the Washington, D.C. law firm of Roundtree, Knox, Hunter and Parker in 1970 following the death of her first law partner Julius Robertson in 1961, Roundtree was special consultant for legal affairs to the AME Church, and General Counsel to the National Council of Negro Women. She was the inspiration for actress Cicely Tyson's depiction of a maverick civil rights lawyer in the television series "Sweet Justice", and the recipient, along with retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, of the American Bar Association's 2000 Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award. In 2011 a scholarship fund was created in her name by the Charlotte Chapter of the National Alumnae Association of Spelman College. Roundtree also received the 2011 Torchbearer Award from the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia, the organization which she integrated in 1962. In March 2013 an affordable senior living facility in the Southeast Washington DC community where she ministered was named "The Roundtree Residences" in her honor. 
Early life and the influences.
Roundtree was born Dovey Mae Johnson in Charlotte, North Carolina, the second oldest of four daughters of James Eliot Johnson, a printer in the local offices of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and Lela Bryant Johnson, a seamstress and domestic. Following the death of her father in the influenza epidemic of 1919, Roundtree and her mother and sisters went to live with her maternal grandmother, Rachel Bryant Graham, and her husband, the Rev. Clyde L. Graham, an AME Zion Church minister. Though Rachel Graham had only a third-grade education, she wielded great influence in Charlotte's black community, and through her involvement in the colored women's club movement she formed a friendship with Mary McLeod Bethune, who at that time traveled extensively through the South as head of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, the precursor to the National Council of Negro Women. Bethune's vision inspired Roundtree to excel academically, rise above poverty and Jim Crow, target a medical career, and work her way through Spelman College from 1934 to 1938, at the height of the Great Depression.
It was Bethune to whom Roundtree turned in 1941, as the threat of war generated unprecedented numbers of jobs for African Americans in the country's "defense preparedness" program. Resigning the South Carolina teaching position she had taken up on college graduation in 1938, she sought out Bethune in Washington, D.C. for assistance in obtaining employment in the burgeoning defense industry. Bethune immediately tapped her for the select group of 40 African American women who were to become the first to train as officers in the newly created Women's Army Auxiliary Corps.
Army service.
Roundtree publicly challenged the racial discrimination she confronted in the rigidly segregated Army even as she recruited other African American women for the WAAC on assignment in the Deep South. Traveling in uniform in the winter of 1943 without Army protection, she was evicted from a Miami bus and forced under threat of arrest to yield her seat to a white Marine. She persisted in her recruiting, bringing African American women into the Corps in such numbers that although the women served in segregated units, the groundwork was laid for an interracial Army four years before President Harry Truman mandated the desegregation of the military by executive order in 1948.
Legal career.
Roundtree first entered the civil rights arena in October 1945 in a nine-month postwar assignment with black labor leader A. Philip Randolph, who was staging a national campaign to make the wartime Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) a permanent entity. Her FEPC involvement brought her into contact with the person who would inspire her to take on the law as her life's mission: Constitutional lawyer Pauli Murray,an impassioned civil rights activist and legal academic who later founded the National Organization for Women. Inspired by Murray's belief that the greatest instrument for social change was the law, Roundtree enrolled at Howard University School of Law in the fall of 1947, one of only five women in her class. From 1947 to 1950, she immersed herself in the assault on school segregation being mounted by Thurgood Marshall and Howard Law professors James Madison Nabrit, Jr. and George E.C. Hayes which in 1954 culminated in the epochal Supreme Court "Brown" decision (Brown v. Board of Education 347 US 483).
Desegregating bus travel.
In 1952, during her first year of legal practice, Roundtree, along with her partner and mentor Julius Winfield Robertson, took on a bus desegregation case that would make legal history: Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company 64 MCC 769 (1955). The case originated in a complaint by an African American WAC private named Sarah Louise Keys, who had been forced by a North Carolina bus driver to yield her seat to a white Marine, just as Roundtree herself had been in 1943 while recruiting for the Army. The Keys case challenged the right of a private bus carrier to impose its Jim Crow laws on black passengers traveling across state lines.
When the matter was dismissed by the US District Court for the District of Columbia on jurisdictional grounds, Roundtree and Robertson took their complaint to the Interstate Commerce Commission,the federal administrative body charged with the enforcement of the Interstate Commerce Act. Turned down by the Commission on their first pass, they filed exceptions, arguing that the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board, handed down in May of that same year, delegitimized segregation not only in public education, but in public transportation as well. On November 7, 1955, in a historic ruling in which the ICC departed from its long history of adherence to the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling (Plessy 163 US 537 (1896), the Commission banned separate but equal for the first time in the field of interstate bus travel. In the Keys case, and in a companion railway case that the NAACP had filed shortly after Keys (NAACP v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company 297 ICC 335 (1955), the ICC broke with its precedent and ruled that the nondiscrimination language of the Interstate Commerce Act prohibited segregation itself.
Though hailed by the press as a historic breakthrough and a "symbol of a movement that cannot be held back," the "Keys" case lay dormant from 1955 to 1961, its intent largely blunted by the ICC commissioner who had dissented from the majority opinion, South Carolina Democrat J. Monroe Johnson. It was not until the summer of 1961, when the violence resulting from the Freedom Riders' campaign prompted Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to take action against the ICC that the impact of the "Keys" case was felt. On May 29, 1961, responding to the protests of civil rights leaders, Kennedy issued a Justice Department petition in which he cited "Keys" and the companion NAACP train case, along with the 1960 Supreme Court Boynton v. Virginia ruling and called upon the ICC to enforce the ruling it had handed down itself in 1955. Under pressure from the Attorney General, the Commission at last acted upon its own rulings and in September 1961 put a permanent end to segregation in travel across state lines.
Washington, D.C..
While fighting the civil rights battle on the national level, Roundtree and her partner Julius Robertson undertook to represent black clients in civil and criminal matters in the segregated courtrooms of Washington, DC. At a time when black lawyers had to leave the courthouses to use the bathrooms and black clients were routinely referred to white attorneys in order to maximize their chances in court, Roundtree and Robertson broke with tradition. They pressed the cases of black clients before white judges and juries and prevailed, winning sizeable recoveries in accident and negligent cases. Their 1957 victory in a negligence case against a Washington, DC psychiatric facility, which resulted in the maximum recovery allowable under the Federal Tort Claims Act at that time, was widely regarded as a turning point not only for black clients in the Nation's Capital, but for black attorneys as well.
The sudden death of her partner Julius Robertson of a heart attack in November 1961 marked a turning point for Dovey Roundtree, who as an African American woman found herself a sole practitioner in a legal community still dominated by men. "At a time when a female lawyer of any race was regarded skeptically, I'd derived a significant measure of credibility from my association with Julius," she later wrote, adding that in the wake of Robertson's death, "there were times when I felt truly vulnerable." Sustained by her ordination into the ministry of the African Methodist Episcopal Church on November 30, 1961, Dovey Roundtree went on to build a thriving law practice, working as a sole practitioner for nine years before founding a second law firm, Roundtree Knox Hunter and Parker, in 1970.
In 1962, she broke another barrier with her nomination for membership to the all-white Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia by attorney Joyce Hens Green (later an Associate Judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit). The nomination precipitated a firestorm of controversy, with several of the Association's board members vehemently opposing Roundtree's nomination. Only when Green demanded a vote by the full membership was Roundtree admitted to the Women's Bar as its first black member.
Ray Crump.
It was Roundtree's successful defense of the black laborer accused of the 1964 murder of alleged Kennedy mistress Mary Pinchot Meyer that solidified her reputation in the Washington, D.C. legal community. For a fee of one dollar, Roundtree took on the defense of Ray Crump, Jr., accused of the execution-style shooting of Meyer as she took her daily walk along the C & O Canal. Crump, who had been found by police wandering along the towpath near the scene of the crime, was arrested on the word of an eyewitness who claimed Crump resembled the black man he had seen standing over Meyer's body moments after the murder. He had then been indicted without a preliminary hearing. Convinced that Crump's limited mental capacity rendered him incapable of perpetrating a murder of such stealth and meticulousness, Roundtree took on the United States government in a July 1965 trial in which the notoriety of the victim drew record crowds of lawyers, law students, and reporters to the United States District Court.
Against the elaborate circumstantial case presented by US Attorney Alfred Hantman and his legal team, Roundtree pitted a single fact: Crump's diminutive size. At five feet three and a half inches and 130 pounds, Roundtree argued, Crump was four to five inches shorter and at least 50 pounds lighter than the man described by the eyewitness. Stunning the court with the brevity and simplicity of her thirty-minute case, Roundtree called only three witnesses, each of whom testified to Crump's good character, and she presented but a single exhibit: Raymond Crump himself.
The not-guilty verdict in the case left permanently open to speculation the possibility of CIA involvement in Meyer's murder. It also cemented Roundtree's reputation among Washington trial lawyers and judges, and resulted in her appointment to high-profile murder cases, including the 1977 defense of John Griffin in a sensational retrial for his alleged role in the murder of a group of Hanafi Muslims at a DC temple.
Advocacy for children and the family.
In the latter years of her practice, Roundtree forged a unique role for herself, melding her ministerial duties at Washington's Allen Chapel AME Church, located in one of the city's most violent neighborhoods, with her legal practice, concentrating her focus on family and ecumenical law. Through religious organizations and legal groups, she became a public advocate for the welfare of young children, who she believed were imperiled by societal violence and the disintegration of the family. She continued in this role following her retirement from active legal practice in 1996.
Awards and honors.
Roundtree has been honored by local and national bar associations and legal and religious institutions. She received the 1995 Distinguished Alumna Award from the Howard Law Alumni Of Greater Washington, the 1995 National Bar Association Charlotte E. Ray Award, the 1996 Spirit of Spelman College Founder's Day Award, the American Bar Association's 2000 Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award, the 2004 Living Legacy Award from the Howard University School of Divinity, and the 2006 Award of Excellence from the Charlotte, North Carolina Chapter of the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund.
Following her retirement to her home in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1996, Roundtree joined such distinguished black elders as John Hope Franklin, Coretta Scott King and Maya Angelou in creating an oral history of her life for the Internet through the National Visionary Leadership Project, founded by activist Camille Cosby and journalist Renee Poussaint. Her 2004 interview with Poussaint appears on the Project's web site at

External commercial borrowing (India)

An external commercial borrowing (ECB) is an instrument used in India to facilitate the access to foreign money by Indian corporations and PSUs (public sector undertakings).
ECBs include commercial bank loans, buyers' credit, suppliers' credit, securitised instruments such as floating rate notes and fixed rate bonds etc., credit from official export credit agencies and commercial borrowings from the private sector window of multilateral financial Institutions such as International Finance Corporation (Washington), ADB, AFIC, CDC, etc.
ECBs cannot be used for investment in stock market or speculation in real estate. The DEA (Department of Economic Affairs), Ministry of Finance, Government of India along with Reserve Bank of India, monitors and regulates ECB guidelines and policies.
For infrastructure and greenfield projects, funding up to 50% (through ECB) is allowed. In telecom sector too, up to 50% funding through ECBs is allowed.
Recently Government of India has increased limits on RBI to up to $40 billions and allowed borrowings in Chinese currency yuan.
Borrowers can use 25 per cent of the ECB to repay rupee debt and the remaining 75 per cent should be used for new projects. A borrower can not refinance its existing rupee loan through ECB. The money raised through ECB is cheaper given near-zero interest rates in the US and Europe, Indian companies can repay their existing expensive loans from that.

Stones in Water

Stones in Water is a 1999 Young Adult novel written by Donna Jo Napoli. It is set during World War II and tells the story of two Italian boys, one who's Jewish, who are sent to a work camp. Their struggle to survive, hide the Jewish boy's nationality, and the defeat of one and escape of another is chronicled. The book won the Golden Kite Award.
Plot.
The story begins with a young Italian boy named Memo asking his friend Roberto if he wants to see a western movie. Roberto has no means of paying for it, so Memo offers to pay in exchange for a ride on Roberto's father's gondola. Roberto accepts, and their Jewish friend Samuele is also invited, and accepts. They decide to meet a bridge in their town, and walk to the movie theater. As Roberto is getting ready, he is discovered by his brother, Sergio, and Sergio decided to accompany Roberto to the movie theater, and Roberto has to compensate for it by agreeing to give Memo two gondola rides, instead of one. When Sergio and Roberto get to the bridge, Sergio is angered that they are bringing someone who is Jewish. Sergio decides to take off Samuele's Star of David and decides that they will walk in two groups, one with Memo and Roberto, and one with Sergio and Samuele, in order to not raise suspicion. They get to the movie theater without arising suspicion, and get seated. Before the movie starts, the Nazi army storms the theater. The movie goers are split into groups based on age and filed into trains heading North to an unknown destination. The trucks stop many times, each time, gathering more Italian boys. These boys speculate over where they are going. During this Samuele gets up, followed by Memo and Roberto. Memo motions to go to the bathroom, and the boys file into the bathroom. Samuele reveals he was going to leave the trains, which Memo thinks is a bad idea. Roberto notices Samuele is circumcised,and acknowledges if this is discovered, Samuele will be caught breaking the law. The boys decide to nickname Samuele Enzo, so that he can have a more Italian sounding name, and Roberto gives Samuele his St. Christoper medal. The boys are taken to a labor camp, where they work on an airstrip. They are only fed bread and sausage, and strip dead boys for warmer clothing. One boy finds out Enzo is Jewish and blackmails Enzo for more food. There is more than this.

The Fairchild Challenge

The Fairchild Challenge is an environmental education outreach program of Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Florida, USA.
Mission.
The Fairchild Challenge is designed to promote environmental awareness, scholarship and stewardship in students in grades pre-K through 12th, and by extension in their families, schools and communities, through a combination of hands-on research, creativity and a variety of competitive projects.
Basic Facts.
Launched in fall 2002, The Fairchild Challenge was developed by scientific and educational experts in botany and biology.
The interdisciplinary nine-month program is offered free every academic year to public and private elementary, middle and high schools throughout South Florida. It is financed by numerous private and public sources, as well as by fundraising by the Fairchild Garden’s young professionals’ organization, Fairchild Palms. During the 2012-2013 school year, participants included 125,000 students from 263 K-12 schools.
Many thousands more participate annually in partner site programs run by educators trained by The Fairchild Challenge personnel at museums, zoos and other institutions throughout the United States and abroad. The program makes special efforts to support the participation of disabled and economically disadvantaged students.
The program.
The Fairchild Challenge consists of three parallel programs for elementary, middle and high schools. Individual schools compete on up to a dozen projects aligned with Florida's Sunshine State Standards. In addition to the sciences, the projects cover social studies, English, art, music and vocational classes. They include generating newsletters, oral histories, and opinion and research papers; creating artwork, postcards, political/environmental cartoons, posters and T-shirts; performing songs and skits on stage; creating and/or restoring gardens or designated habitats; conducting oral debates; preparing “green cuisine” meals; designing solar-powered devices; and undertaking ecological initiatives such as recycling, conducting waste and energy audits, and initiating tree plantings at home, at school and in their communities. Every project completed scores points, and top-scoring schools are recognized with Fairchild Challenge Awards at a ceremony at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden at the end of each school year.
Impact.
Since its founding in 2002, The Fairchild Challenge has spread beyond South Florida by conducting partner site trainings for dozens of museums, zoos, botanical gardens and other institutions throughout the U.S. (Chicago and Utah) and as far as Singapore and South Africa. These institutions provide their own customized Fairchild Challenge programs for their area schools based on the original South Florida model.
Recognition.
In November 2008, The Fairchild Challenge was endorsed by the Conservation Fund’s National Forum on Children and Nature (NFCN) as a worldwide model for connecting youth with the environment in new and creative ways. The NFCN, composed of leaders from the public and private sectors, selected the Fairchild Challenge from among 560 competing programs based on relevance, impact and sustainability. The endorsement also was given to 29 other organizations in 2008.
The endorsement by the NFCN was featured in the Environment section of The Miami Herald on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2009.

Typecasting (blogging)

A typecast (blogging) (a.k.a. typecasting or typecasting blog) is a form of blogging by media type and publishing in the format of a blog, but differentiated by the predominant use of and focus on text created with a typewriter and then scanned rather than text entered directly into a computer. Typecasting (the action of posting scanned typewritten images to a typecasting blog) is still a relatively rare form of a media type blog similar to vblog and photoblogs.
Construction.
There are several reasons to create typecasting blogs. For writers who prefer the use of typewriters to write text manually it remains the best way to post electronic copies of their original text. These texts or portions of texts may include unedited text, handwritten edits, notes or signs of proofreading that allow the reader to see the raw text complete with typos, errors and corrections. Typecasting may appeal to fans of or collectors of typewriters and some typecasters employ the use of several different machines or styles of machines to create their posts. Some typecasters are writers who dislike word processors or who reject computers use as a writing tools even if they use them for revisions. Other typecasters pay tribute to manual forms of writing and like the appeal of typecasting, including writers "...who like the sound of a typewriter bell at the end of a sentence". Lastly, many people that typecast do so in order to preserve typewriting as a means of creating texts, a means of remembering a vanishing skill or as a form of manual communication. 
Typecast blogs may be posted on individual domains, typecast blogs on blogging services such as Blogger that were designed primarily for electronically entered text content, and sketchblogs or image specific blogging services.

Roger Williams (organist)

Dr Roger Bevan Williams, MBE (born 30 August 1943) is a British (Welsh) organist and musicologist. In 2010, he retired as Master of Ceremonial Music and Organist to the University of Aberdeen, a Music department in which he had been a member for over 30 years.
Biography.
Born in Swansea, Williams began his musical education at the Huddersfield School of Music (now part of the University) where he studied Piano, Organ, Harpsichord, Harp, Viola, Conducting and Composition. He graduated with BMus Honours from the University of Wales (University College Cardiff) before proceeding to Goldsmiths' College, University of London, for a Post Graduate Certificate in Education. At King's College Cambridge he gained PhD for his research into the early works of Arnold Schoenberg.
Williams spent eight years in London as a free-lance conductor, organist, harpsichordist, singer and composer. He held various church posts while also running a small opera company, singing as an ad hoc singer with the BBC Singers and performing at major London concert venues (Royal Festival Hall, Royal Albert Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room, Wigmore Hall).
He was, briefly, Head of the Chiswick Evening Music Centre and Lecturer at the West London Institute. In 1978 he took up the post of Lecturer in the Music Department at Aberdeen University and was later appointed Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. Following the closure of the Music Department in Aberdeen (now re-established) he was appointed Music Director and Organist to the University.
Williams continues to teach and work in Aberdeen where he has enjoyed a long association with the Haddo House Choral & Operatic Society and the North East of Scotland Music School. He was made MBE in the UK Honours list of 2009. Recognising his many years of service and astounding number of recitals at their institution, Williams was made an honorary Doctor of Music from the University of Aberdeen in July 2011.
Professional life.
For the first 15 years of his appointment in Scotland Williams also held the post of Organist at the Church of Our Lady of Victories, Kensington High Street where he advised on the rebuilding of an 1870s Willis organ. Previously he had been an Assistant Organist at Holy Trinity Church Brompton, then Organist at St. Patrick’s Soho Square, and Music Director and Organist at the Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon.
During the 1980s he was Chorus Master to the Scottish National Orchestra (now RSNO), working with conductors such as Alexander Gibson, Neeme Järvi, Yuri Ahronovich, Gary Bertini, Norman Del Mar, Christopher Seaman, Simon Rattle, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Bryden Thomson, Richard Hickox, and Yan Pascal Tortelier. The chorus gave the first broadcast of Britten's War Requiem on Italian radio on a tour to Turin and, on a tour to Jerusalem, the world premier of its first commission, "Pipes of Peace" by Eddie McGuire.
In 1990 he was appointed Organist to the University and had the Harrison and Harrison organ in the Chapel at King's College revoiced and tuned to an unequal temperament. As Master of Ceremonial Music he helped to acquire the new Aubertin - the first in the UK. He has since commissioned several leading composers to write pieces specially conceived for this instrument.
On 31 August 2010, he retired as Master of Chapel and Ceremonial Music to the University of Aberdeen. He celebrated this with a concert of organ works at the University Chapel, including the famous Bach Toccata in d minor.
On 16 September 2010, Williams performed during the Papal Mass at Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, as part of Pope Benedict XI's tour of the United Kingdom.
Currently, Williams remains a visiting pianoforte and organ tutor to students at the University of Aberdeen and the North East of Scotland Music School. He continues to perform across Aberdeenshire, to direct ensembles including the Aberdeen Diocesan Choir and undertaking further academic research on the music collections of Scottish castles and country houses.

Ishikawa Toyonobu

A pupil of Nishimura Shigenaga, Toyonobu produced many monochrome "lacquer prints" ("urushi-e") which reflected the influence of Okumura Masanobu as well. Many of these were "yakusha-e" (actor prints) and "bijinga" (images of beautiful women), including images of standing courtesans, whose faces conveyed an impassivity typical of the works of the Kaigetsudō school.
Toyonobu also experimented with semi-nude forms, something his chief predecessors also did, but never succeeded in developing it into a trend or sub-genre within "ukiyo-e". Art historian Richard Lane points out that these images, depicting women with the top half of their kimono open and let down to reveal their chests, were intended as suggestive and erotic, and were not "glorification of the human form such as we find in Greek art."
Later in his career, Toyonobu became one of the leading producers of color prints, chiefly "benizuri-e" ("rose prints"), but stopped producing "ukiyo-e" shortly after Suzuki Harunobu pioneered the full-color print ("nishiki-e") in 1765.
He had one notable pupil, Ishikawa Toyomasa, who is known chiefly for his depictions of children at play, and who may have been Toyonobu's son.

Cesvaine Palace

Cesvaine Palace (; ) is located in the town of Cesvaine, Latvia in the Madona District. Next to the palace are the old medieval castle ruins, remains from the old bishops castle.
History.
Cesvaine Palace was built in 1896 for the German baron Emil von Wulf (not to be confused with the von Wolf baronial family). Authors of the project were architects Hans Grisebach and August Dinklage from Berlin. The palace is built in the late Tudor Neo-Renaissance style. It is a very impressive palace in this style.
At the end of the 19th century, Germany abandoned the reproduction of old German prototypes and turned to England in search of inspiration, namely to late Tudor-style architecture. The style had preserved certain Gothic elements. Picturesque frames, towers and turrets of different forms and sizes, high decorative chimneys and steep roofs were all characteristic features of the style.
The palace has survived all revolutions and wars of the twentieth century, so interiors were almost in perfect condition. Unfortunately in 2002 the palace suffered heavily in a fire. All of the roof and second floor was destroyed and the first floor was seriously damaged. But, many interior elements survived and will be restored. Although restoration works has started, due to the lack of finances they are proceeding very slowly. The last few decades there was a local secondary school housed in the palace.

Fernando and Greg in the Morning

Fernando and Greg in the Morning is a San Francisco-based morning radio program on KMVQ-FM / 99.7 Now featuring the first openly gay duo to host a morning broadcast on American commercial radio. The show is hosted by Fernando Ventura and Greg Sherrell and features producer, Jason Dahlstedt as a third and ‘straight’ voice on the show.
Show origin.
The comedy duo have been paired on the air in some fashion since March 2005, when Ventura became the first morning show host at now defunct dance station KNGY–FM / Energy 92.7. Sherrell initially joined the show as a once-a-week call-in contributor as Greg the Gay Sportscaster hosting the Sassy Sports segment, which later become a show benchmark.
Background.
Fernando grew up in suburban Philadelphia and has worked for major Top 40 stations in New York, Philadelphia, Dallas and San Francisco. Before doing mornings in San Francisco, Fernando was most recently music director and assistant program director at top-rated KHKS KISS in Dallas, TX. 
Greg, a Texas native, grew up near Fort Worth and then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he met Fernando in 1996 at then – Top 40 powerhouse KHFI. Greg worked in promotions at KHFI before moving on to Clear Channel San Antonio where he was the promotions director for the FM stations before reuniting with Fernando at KHKS Dallas in 2004, where he served as the promotions director. 
Jason is a Bay Area native from Hayward, California. He attended Sonoma State University. Before working with Fernando and Greg, Jason worked with Sarah and No Name at Alice 97.3, and was an on air personality at KEZR Mix 106.5 in San Jose, California. Jason joined Fernando & Greg in the Morning as producer in June 2007.
About the show.
In addition to Sassy Sports, Fernando and Greg in the Morning features a bi-weekly game called “Homo vs. Hetero”, putting one gay player against one straight player in a battle of wits. A weekly phone call from Greg’s mother, Ginger, is another show feature. When doing sassy sports, at the end, Fernando and Greg would say "If they're playing with balls, I'm all over them."
Fernando & Greg on Energy 92.7.
The two first made waves at independently-owned dance station KNGY in 2006 when they had an on air confrontation with San Francisco Pride who would not let the duo in as a part of the Pride Parade due to a commitment to another radio group. The confrontation played out on the air and the duo was later allowed in to the parade. The relationship between Fernando and Greg and Pride continues to be amicable. In 2007, the show also made local headlines after an on-air fight with members of the organization GLAAD. 
Fernando and Greg in the Morning was off the air briefly in 2009 when KNGY was sold to Golden State Broadcasting (formerly Silver State Broadcasting) on September 10, 2009 and the station changed formats. Outraged fans of Fernando & Greg and Energy 92.7 voiced their anger on social networks and other media outlets. The campaign eventually culminated in the San Francisco board of supervisors passing a resolution urging the new owner of 92.7 to reinstate the popular morning show hosts and dance format.
Fernando & Greg on Movin 99.7.
The duo returned to the air on November 12, 2009 as the new morning show at KMVQ-FM.
Fernando & Greg on TV.
In 2008, Meg–TV, a Bay Area production company approached Fernando and Greg to develop a reality show. Logo TV agreed in 2009 to shoot a pilot, but later declined to pick it up as a series.
In March 2009, Fernando & Greg began hosting Fabulous Flicks on KOFY-TV. The show, airing Sunday nights at 9 p.m. features camp movies with commentary from Fernando & Greg.
Awards and accolades.
In 2007, Out Magazine named Fernando and Greg in their “Top 100 People of the Year” edition and in 2008 they received the Fall Honors award from northern California chapter of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association. In 2009 “Fernando and Greg in the Morning” was named as SF Weekly’s Best Morning Show and as favorite morning show in SF Magazine’s Readers Poll.

Scene statistics

Scene statistics is a discipline within the field of perception. It is concerned with the statistical regularities related to scenes. It is based on the premise that a perceptual system is designed to interpret scenes.
Biological perceptual systems have evolved in response to physical properties of natural environments. Therefore natural scenes receive a great deal of attention.
Natural scene statistics are useful for defining the behavior of an ideal observer in a natural task, typically by incorporating signal detection theory, information theory, or estimation theory.
Within-domain versus across-domain.
Geisler (2008) distinguishes between four kinds of domains: (1) Physical environments, (2) Images/Scenes, (3) Neural responses, and (4) Behavior.
Within the domain of images/scenes, one can study the characteristics of information related to redundancy and efficient coding.
Across-domain statistics determine how an autonomous system should make inferences about its environment, process information, and control its behavior. To study these statistics, it is necessary to sample or register information in multiple domains simultaneously.
The image above was generated from a database of segmented leaves that simultaneously registers natural images (scene information) with the exact locations of leaf boundaries (information about the physical environment). Such a database can be used to study across-domain statistics.
Many papers have been published in the area of scene statistics.

It is within the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County and is managed by the US Forest Service. It was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System when the US Congress passed the California Wilderness Act of 1984.
The Russian Wilderness protects the Russian Mountains, a portion of the high crest of the Salmon Mountains, which are composed of metamorphic and granitic rock. There are over twenty named lakes at different elevation levels as well as the major watersheds of the Scott River and North Fork Salmon River.
The Russian is one of three wilderness areas that form an almost continuous chain, from the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the south, and the Marble Mountain Wilderness in the north, these areas provide an important corridor for wildlife such as the migrating herds of black-tailed deer. The Russian Wilderness is part of the largest nearly roadless complex in northwestern California.
Elevations range from to the high point of the wilderness, Russian Peak, at [].
Flora and fauna.
There are several stands of conifers that are rare for California, including subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce in the wilderness. The region gained prominence amongst botanists in the 1970s when Dale Thornburgh and John Sawyer began conducting studies in Sugar Creek. In addition to discovering the first stands of subalpine fir in California, the diversity of other conifers they found here was reason for pause and then return studies. In all, after several years of research, they discovered 17 species of conifers in one square mile—of varied terrain—below the peak. Those conifers are: foxtail pine, whitebark pine, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, sugar pine, white fir, Shasta fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, Brewer spruce, mountain hemlock, Douglas-fir, incense-cedar, common juniper, and Pacific yew. An 18th conifer, the western juniper, was documented and reported by Richard Moore in 2013.
Rare perennials include the Siskiyou fireweed ("Epilobium siskiyouense"), and several types of lousewort ("Pedicularis"). The rare annual Siskiyou phacelia ( "Phacelia leonis"), was observed by John O. Sawyer and J. Smith in 1988. Siskiyou phacelia has bell-shaped blue-purple flowers, blooms in summer, and grows in serpentine soils.
The wilderness protects habitats for American black bear, deer, Douglas squirrel, California quail and rattlesnakes. Less common animals include the fisher, marten, wolverine, pileated woodpecker, beaver, coyote and mountain lion. Rainbow trout, eastern brook trout and brown trout are found in the lakes and streams.
Geology.
The wilderness is dominated by glacier-carved granite crags, dating from the Mesozoic, similar to the Sierra Nevada. This results in similar surface topography, including cirques and U-shaped glacial valleys. Similar to the Ritter Range, a chain of dark metavolcanic rock is dominant in the mountains along the edge of the wilderness.
Recreation.
The Pacific Crest Trail travels along the Salmon Mountain crest. The Bigfoot Trail passes through the wilderness for where it crosses the Salmon Mountain crest, from Syphon Lake to Russian Creek. Because of the small size of the wilderness, visitors can reach the highlights in less than two hours of hiking or horseback riding.
Ski and snowshoe trips are possible with four cirque (glacial lake) basins providing good telemark skiing. Major drainages are the North Fork Salmon and Scott rivers and have populations of rainbow trout and steelhead salmon.
Roadless areas.
There are three separate units totaling adjacent to the wilderness. These roadless areas have stands of old growth forests of oak and madrone growing in a terrain of glacially modified landscape, with U-shaped valleys and granite crags.

Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Solomon Islands)

The Solomon Islands Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is a commission officially established by the government of Solomon Islands on April 29, 2009. It has been formed to investigate the causes of the ethnic violence that gripped Solomon Islands between 1997 and 2003. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is the first of its kind in the Pacific Islands region. 
The purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to "address people's traumatic experiences during the five year ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal (1999–2004)". Its goal is to promote national unity and reconciliation. The members of the TRC will hear testimony from witnesses and victims of the violence, which killed over 100 people and displaced more than 20,000 internal refugees nationwide.
It is modelled after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, which was chaired by then Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has taken an active role in the establishment of the TRC in Solomon Islands.
Background of the conflict.
The Solomon Islands descended into ethnic violence between 1997 and 2003. Much of the violence was committed by rival ethnic gangs from the islands of Guadalcanal and Malaita. The gangs took advantage of ethnic tensions between Malaitan settlers on Guadalcanal and the island's indigenous residents. The Isatabu Freedom Movement, which was made up by indigenous residents of the island of Guadalcanal, fought for several years with the Malaita Eagle Force, a militia group consisting mainly of residents and settlers from Malaita. The two groups fought for political power, jobs and land rights, especially on the island of Guadalcanal.
The violence was finally quelled by the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which was invited into the country by the government of former Prime Minister Allan Kemakeza in 2003. RAMSI finalised operations in the Solomon Islands as of September 2013.
Formation of the Commission.
In late August 2008, Sam Iduri, Minister for Peace and Reconciliation, introduced a Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill to the National Parliament of Solomon Islands. In February 2009, it was reported that Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, would visit the Solomons in April to assist in setting up the Commission.
Australia has contributed approximately 500,000 towards the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
Commission members.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is composed of five members, three of which are citizens of the Solomon Islands, while two others were chosen from outside of the country. There are three men and two women.
The National Selection Committee was charged with choosing the five members of the TRC. The Chairman of the National Selection Committee, Chief Justice of the Solomon Islands Supreme Court Sir Albert Palmer, submitted the names of the proposed members to the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands on April 22, 2009, as required by the Truth and Reconciliation Act of 2008 (TRC Act, 2008).
The Prime Minister of Solomon Islands Derek Sikua announced the five members of the TRC on April 27, 2009, two days before the launch of the Commission. Sikua thanked the selection committee for working to choose the members of the commission. "I also wish to thank our people for their participation and in thanking them, I wish to call on our people to help the Truth and Reconciliation Commission because without the Truth there can be no true reconciliation and thus no lasting national peace, unity and healing."
By law, the members of the TRC must begin their investigations within fourteen days of their appointment by Prime Minister Sikua.
The five members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) are:
Opening of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
The Commission was officially launched on April 29, 2009, at the Lawson Tama Stadium in Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands. 
Thousands of Solomon Islanders attended the opening, which included a speech by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu spoke of the need for forgiveness in the country to achieve a long term, sustainable peace. Prime Minister Derek Sikua told the crowd that the TRC marked an important day in the history of Solomon Islands and the years of ethnic violence which engulfed the country, "The launching of the Commission is a vital part of the efforts as Solomon Islands continue to work towards closure of a most challenging chapter in the history of the country, when disputes led to conflict and conflict erupted into violence between communities."
Tutu is also hosting a conference called the Winds of Change, which will bring together former combatants from Malaita and Guadalcanal for reconciliation talks.
Beginning of public hearings.
The Commission's first public hearings were held in March 2010, with victims called upon to describe their sufferings during the violence. The Commission explained that the aim of the process was to provide victims with an opportunity to be heard, "end thsilence and make the whole country to give recognition to their sufferings" : "Above all, it will help to restore the dignity of the victims, to retrieve the memory of those who were killed, and to hear the voice of those who were humiliated and abused in countless ways." Victims were permitted to name groups who had caused their suffering, but not individuals. The Commission would not pass judgement, but treat the hearings as "moments to listen with respect and compassion".
The opening of the hearings was attended by Governor-General Frank Kabui, Prime Minister Derek Sikua, Speaker of Parliament Sir Peter Kenilorea and the Chief Justice.

Croes-goch

Croes-goch is a village in North Pembrokeshire, West Wales. It is situated on the A487 between Fishguard and St David's. It lies some 5 miles north east of St Davids on the
junction of the A487 St Davids to Fishguard road with the B4330 Llanrhian to Haverfordwest. The village, which has a
population of about 400, lies within Llanrhian Community Council area and lies 2 miles to the south of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.
History.
There are a number of ancient burial mounds in the general vicinity and a previous site of a windmill. An old private tollgate still stands and is now used as a holiday cottage. Croesgoch lies on one of the pilgrimage routes to St Davids. The special carved stone, Mesur y Dorth, indicates a spot where people shared their bread before the last stage of their journey.
The name of the village is thought to originate from a battle which occurred near the village and resulted in a slaughter and a mythical river of blood that formed a cross - Croes-Goch. The oldest archaeological remains that have been found in the village is a cist burial tomb carbon dated c 500 AD unearthed during building work.
The Baptist Chapel, which is situated near the village centre, was built in 1858 and played a crucial role in village life. Local churches include Llanrhian and Llanhywel.
On an 1842 Tithe Map is shown only a small group of three or so cottages with a building designated as a Chapel. Similarly the 1841 census shows only a small group of 3 cottages.
Over the years the village has grown with building mainly taking place on the Llanrhian,Abereidy and Trefeigan roads.
The Modern Village.
The village now has various amenities. There is an extremely modern, successful and bilingual primary school, Ysgol Gymunedol Croesgoch. The Chapel is still functioning with services on a fortnightly basis. There are two art galleries run by well-known artists (one being John Knapp-Fisher). There is a garage (Forge Garage) for vehicle maintenance and MOTs and a large farm store (Croesgoch Farm Stores). The local pub, The Artramont Arms, offers takeway meals as well as a friendly drinking environment. It also offers Post Office services. The post office is temporarily closed, but with regular collections. There is a village general carpenter, metal worker and undertaker. Village people are employed in these activities and many travel further afield for their employment and others are employed in holiday and service industries in the locality. A construction company (Carreg Construction) is based in the village and building work is carried out in the village also employing some local people.
Croesgoch was the first North Pembrokeshire village to have broadband enabled back in April 2004 which has enabled local businesses, residents and the school to connect to the World Wide Web at much faster speeds than previously experienced on dial-up.
Culture.
The Croesgoch Garden Show committee organises the annual show which takes place at the school. This has been running for 65 years. Other events include fireworks (which is organised by the pub in the field next to Felinwynt), carol singing, the nearby church fete in Llanrhian which takes place in August and Llanhywel Church Strawberry Fair and the school summer fete in July, and women come together to recite poetry. Every year in the month of June a vintage tractor run is held in Croesgoch and it attracts much local interest.

Risk appetite

Risk Appetite is a method to help guide an organisation’s approach to risk and risk management.
Definition.
The level of risk that an organization is prepared to accept, before action is deemed necessary to reduce it. It represents a balance between the potential benefits of innovation and the threats that change inevitably brings.
Levels of risk appetite.
The appropriate level will depend on the nature of the work undertaken and the objectives pursued. For example, where public safety is critical (e.g. operating a nuclear power station) appetite will tend to be low, while for an innovative project (e.g. early development on an innovative computer program) it may be very high, with the acceptance of short term failure that could pave the way to longer term success.
Below are examples of broad approaches to setting risk appetite that a business may adopt to ensure a response to risk that is proportionate given their business objectives. 
Averse Avoidance of risk and uncertainty is a key organization objective.
Minimal Preference for ultra-safe options that are low risk and only have a potential for limited reward. 
Cautious Preference for safe options that have a low degree of risk and may only have limited potential for reward. 
Open Willing to consider all potential options and choose the one most likely to result in successful delivery, while also providing an acceptable level of reward and value for money.
Hungry Eager to be innovative and to choose options offering potentially higher business rewards, despite greater inherent risk.
The appropriate approach may vary across an organization, with different parts of the business adopting an appetite that reflects their specific role, with an overarching risk appetite framework to ensure consistency.
Measuring risk appetite.
Precise measurement is not always possible and risk appetite will sometimes be defined by a broad statement of approach. An organisation may have an appetite for some types of risk and be averse to others, depending on the context and the potential losses or gains. 
However, often measures can be developed for different categories of risk. For example, it may aid a project to know what level of delay or financial loss it is permitted to bear. Where an organization has standard measures to define the impact and likelihood of risks, this can be used to define the maximum level of risk tolerable before action should be taken to lower it.
Purpose and benefits.
By defining its risk appetite, an organisation can arrive at an appropriate balance between uncontrolled innovation and excessive caution. It can guide people on the level of risk permitted and encourage consistency of approach across an organisation. 
A defined acceptable levels of risk also means that resources are not spent on further reducing risks that are already at an acceptable level. 
Main areas of risk appetite.
In literature there are six main areas of risk appetite:
There is often a confusion between 'risk management' and 'risk appetite', with the rigor of the former now recovering some of its lost ground from the vagueness of the latter. Derived correctly the risk appetite is a consequence of a rigorous risk management analysis not a precursor. Simple risk management techniques deal with the expectation values of the consequences of hazardous events, but this ignores the possibility of collateral effects of a bad outcome, such as for example becoming technically bankrupt. The quantity that can be put at risk depends on the cover available should there be a loss, and a proper analysis takes this into account. The 'appetite' follows logically from this analysis. For example an organization should be 'hungry for risk' if it has more than ample cover compared with its competitors and should therefore be able to gain greater returns in the market from high risk ventures.

Vaudreuil-sur-le-Lac, Quebec

Vaudreuil-sur-le-Lac is a village municipality in Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality in the Montérégie region of Quebec, Canada. It is located on the western portion of the Vaudreuil Peninsula, which projects into Lake of Two Mountains. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census was 1,359.
Vaudreuil-sur-le-Lac is predominantly residential (90%), and only 10% industrial and commercial. The Club Nautique des Deux-Montagnes attracts a large number of sailing enthusiasts.
History.
Early in the twentieth century, the first vacationers arrived here, attracted to the beauty of the lakeshore. May 19, 1920, marked the date of the incorporation of the village Municipality of Belle-Plage (meaning "beautiful beach"), with Ludger Dupont as first mayor. Belle-Plage was then primarily known as a vacation destination: there were 77 owners for a total of about 300 people but only seven families residing here permanently.
On January 4, 1960, the Municipal Council changed the name of "Belle-Plage" to "Vaudreuil-sur-le-Lac". The new village name is a reference to the historic Vaudreuil Seignory, granted to and named after Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, Governor of New France from 1703 to 1725.
In the early 1960s, the region began to be transformed into a residential suburb of Montreal City following the construction of the Île aux Tourtes Bridge and Highway 40, which passes Vaudreuil-sur-le-Lac just to the south. Consequently, in the late sixties the village began to witness a perceptible increase in population.

Liao Yiwu

Liao Yiwu (; also known as Lao Wei) (born 1958 in Sichuan), is a Chinese author, reporter, musician, and poet. He is a
critic of China's Communist regime, for which he has been imprisoned. His books, several of which are collections of interviews with ordinary people from the lower rungs of Chinese society, were published in Taiwan and Hong Kong but are banned in mainland China; some have been translated into English, French, German and Polish.
Life and career.
Becoming a state writer.
Liao was born in 1958, the same year as The Great Leap Forward. During the famine of The Great Leap Forward, he suffered from edema and was close to dying. In 1966 his father was branded a counter-revolutionary during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Liao's parents filed for divorce to protect the children. His mother was arrested for attempting to sell government issued coupons on the black market.
After High School, Liao traveled around the country. In his spare time he read banned Western poets such as John Keats and Charles Baudelaire. He also started composing his own poems and was getting published in literary magazines. 
He failed the university entrance exams and began to work for a newspaper. When his poetry was noticed, the Chinese Ministry of Culture gave him a paid position as state writer.
Criticism of the system and imprisonment.
In Spring 1989, two magazine companies took advantage of the relaxed politics and carried Liao's long poems "The Yellow City" and "Idol." In the poems, he criticized the system, calling it paralyzed and eaten away by a collective leukemia. The poems were deemed anti-communist and he was questioned and detained and his home was searched.
On June 1989, after hearing about the Tiananmen Square protests, Liao composed a long poem entitled "Massacre." Knowing that it would never be published, he made an audiotape and recited the poem by using Chinese ritualistic chanting and howling, invoking the spirits of the dead. Liao and friends made a movie, the sequel of Massacre, "Requiem."
He was arrested in February 1990 as he was boarding a train. Six friends and his pregnant wife were arrested separately. Liao received a four-year sentence. He was placed on the government's permanent blacklist. While in prison, due to torture and abusive punishment, he suffered several mental breakdowns and twice attempted suicide. He was known as "the big lunatic." From a fellow prisoner, an elderly monk, he learned to play the Xiao. He then began to interview other prisoners about their lives.
When he was released from prison, his wife and their daughter left him, and his former literary friends kept their distance. He lived for a while as a homeless street musician in Chengdu, collecting stories.
Work after his release, and international success.
Liao processed the time in prison with his book "Testimonials". A German translation of this work is planned for 2010.
In 1998 he compiled "The Fall of the Holy Temple", an anthology of underground poems from the 1970s, mainly from Chinese dissidents. One of China's vice premiers called it a "premeditated attempt to overthrow the government, and is supported by powerful anti-China groups."
In 2001 his multi-volume "Interviews with People from the Bottom Rung of Society" was published in Taiwan. The book consists of transcribed interviews with people on the margins of Chinese society, from "hustlers to drifters, outlaws and street performers, the officially renegade and the physically handicapped, those who deal with human waste and with the wasting of humans, artists and shamans, crooks, even cannibals." Although it is currently banned in China, the book is easily found on Chinese file sharing websites. He was arrested several times for conducting "illegal interviews" and for exposing the dark side of the Communist Party.
A French translation of some of these interviews titled "L'Empire des bas-fonds" appeared in 2003. An English translation of 27 of the interviews was published under the name "The Corpse Walker" in 2008. A German translation, "Fräulein Hallo und der Bauernkaiser", appeared in 2009.
In 2008 he signed the Charter 08 of his friend Liu Xiaobo, although he says of himself that he is not really interested in politics, just in his stories.
In May 2008, after the Sichuan earthquake, Liao went to the disaster region and interviewed survivors fighting corrupt officials. This material was published as "Chronicles of the Big Earthquake" in Hong Kong in 2009. The French translation "Quand la terre s’est ouverte au Sichuan : Journal d’une tragédie" appeared in 2010.
After having been denied permission to leave the country many times, he wrote an open letter to Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel in February 2010. Later that year he was allowed to leave the country for the first time. He visited Germany accepting invitations to literary festivals in Hamburg and Berlin as well as to an event in Cologne. He held numerous readings and gave interviews. On stage, he sang songs, played the flute and drank hard liquor.
Prior to his departure from China, he lived under police surveillance with his wife in Chengdu, supporting himself with the royalties from his books published abroad.
April 2011: Travel Ban for "National Security" Reasons, Arrival in Germany.
Liao Yiwu in an email dated April 1, 2011 wrote:
Friends:
I originally planned to leave for the United States on April 4 in order to make a publicity tour for my book God is Red which will be published in English translation by Harper Collins and for my book The Corpse Walker which was published by Random House.
Unexpectedly, on March 28th, the police issued an order forbidding me to leave China.
I had originally planned to travel to San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, New York, Washington and other cities and to give lectures, readings and musical performances at Harvard, Yale and other universities as well as participate in the New York Literary Festival where I was to make a speech and perform, and to have a dialogue with writers from around the world on the theme "Contemporary Writer and Bearing Witness to History". Now all this has been canceled.
My new book is also going to be published in Australia. My plan to travel from the United States to Australia has also been canceled.
Ever since my return from Germany last year, I have been closely monitored. The police have "invited me to drink tea" many times. My writing has been repeatedly interrupted.
I have once again been forbidden to travel abroad for national security reasons.
Over the last ten or so years I have strived to get the right to travel abroad 16 times. I succeeded once and failed 15 times.
Thank you all for your concern for me over the years.
Liao Yiwu
Liao arrived in Germany on July 6, 2011, having left China overland by crossing the border with Vietnam.
Awards.
In 2003, he was awarded a Human Rights Watch Hellman-Hammett Grant. In 2007, he received a Freedom to Write Award from the Independent Chinese PEN Center. Authorities prevented him from attending the award ceremony in Beijing. In 2011 he was awarded the German Geschwister-Scholl-Preis and in 2012 the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade.
In his address at the price ceremony in the Paulskirche, Liao Yiwu described China as "the source of global disasters" and an "ever-expanding garbage dump". He concluded his speech with the wish that "for the peaceful well-being of all humanity, this empire (China) must break apart".

Court–Cowan Ministry

The Court–Cowan Ministry was the 32nd Ministry of the Government of Western Australia, and was led by Liberal Premier Richard Court and his deputy, the Nationals' Hendy Cowan. It succeeded the Lawrence Ministry on 16 February 1993, following the defeat of the Labor government at the 1993 election ten days earlier. The Ministry was reconstituted on 9 January 1997 following the December 1996 election, due in part to the retirement and resignation of several ministers—Richard Lewis, Kevin Minson, Roger Nicholls and Bob Wiese. The ministry was followed by the Gallop Ministry on 16 February 2001 after the Coalition lost government at the state election held on 16 February.

Derby Philosophical Society

The Derby Philosophical Society was a club for gentleman in Derby founded in 1783 by Erasmus Darwin. The club had many notable members and also offered the first institutional library in Derby that was available to some section of the public.
History.
Clubs and societies were one of the most important aspects of public and semi-public life in Georgian Britain, although women were excluded from many of the more formal. Many took a keen interest in science, or natural philosophy as it would have been called, and so should be seen as important local centres for the production and dissemination of ideas as part of the European enlightenment. Some were informal associations but others were highly organised with rules and regulations and sometimes their own rooms or buildings. Quite a few acquired collections of books, scientific instruments or natural history exhibits, either through purchase or bequest.
A Derby Philosophical club or society met in the eighteenth century and may have included amongst its members individuals such as John Whitehurst, the Lunar Society member, before he moved to London in 1775. The society was meeting until at least 1779 although other clubs or coteries existed in the town prior to this. Another of these, also associated with Whitehurst seems to have included the artist Joseph Wright, his friend Peter Perez Burdett and Rev. Joshua Winter of All Saints Church.
The Derby Philosophical Society was started by Erasmus Darwin and a group of his associates in 1783 just after he moved to Derby from Lichfield, and after living for a short period at Radburn Hall with his new wife Elizabeth and her family. The club was formally inaugurated in 1784 at Darwin's house in Full Street, Derby. He delivered an address to the members which explained what he hoped the society would achieve, including the acquisition of a library and perhaps the production of publications. It seems that he also hoped the Derby Society would be able to hold joint meetings with the 'Lunatics'.
The purposes of the club were several. However the club did create a notable collection of books and entertained guests, some of whom are listed in the records. Its members participated in a collective translation of the works of Linnaeus from Latin to English. The translation of "A System of Vegetables", annotated by the most eminent of them, was the first book where the name of Erasmus Darwin ever appeared.
The society met at the King's Head Inn in the Cornmarket in Derby not far from Darwin's house at 3, Full Street.
The founding members were at various times said to be seven, eight or ten people listed as Richard French, Sneyd, Dr John Hollis Pigot, Dr John Beridge, Dr Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Gisborne, Mr. Fox and William Strutt. However Gisborne and Sneyd did not live in Derby so this leaves seven plus Erasmus Darwin who is considered the main reason for the club's existence. The records of the club exist but frequently refer to people only by surname so researchers have had to consider which particular person was intended. The purpose of the club involved meeting socially but there was a variety of interests although many of the members, like Darwin, were associated with medicine. Later members included Josiah Wedgwood, the Rev. William Pickering, the Rev. Charles Hope, Dr Peter Crompton, Erasmus Darwin Jr, Robert Darwin, Richard Leaper and Henry Hadley, Mr Haden, Mr Fowler, Mr Johnson, Sacheverell Pole, William Duesbury jr, Robert Bage and Richard Archdale. About half of the membership was medical like William Brooks Johnson MD, but others included men of great influence like Sir Robert Wilmot, the engineer Jedediah Strutt, the poet and gentleman Sir Brooke Boothby, the chemist Charles Sylvester, and landowners Charles Hurt, Reverend D'Ewes Coke and Thomas Evans. Crompton, Leaper, and C. S. Hope all went on to become Mayor of Derby, and the first Lord Belper was among the later members.
William Strutt and Richard Forester were both to go on to be presidents of the society following Darwin's death in 1803. Strutt had been a founding member and Forester was the son of Richard French, another founding member. The local schoolmaster and philosopher William George Spencer was secretary of the society from 1815 and his son the philosopher Herbert Spencer gained much inspiration from Derby literary and scientific culture. Significantly it was Spencer who coined the phrase "survival of the fittest", after he read Darwin's grandson's work on evolution. Another notable associate of the society was Abraham Bennet although he was never a member, unlike James Pilkington, the radical minister and the author of a "A View of Derbyshire".
During Darwin's time as the leading light of the society he had a house on Full Street in Derby. Although this house is now demolished a plaque was placed on the site in 2002 to recognise Darwin's contribution and that he had founded the Derby Philosophical Society.
The Derby Philosophical Society was just one of a number of literary and scientific associations that existed in the town during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries reflecting the importance of public scientific culture in the English provinces at this time. Other examples include a Derby Literary and Philosophical Society c1808-1816, the Derby Mechanics' Institute, the Derby Town and County Museum and Natural History Society founded in 1834, and another Literary and Scientific Society that flourished during the 1840s and 1850s. To these should be added the innovative Derbyshire General Infirmary opened in 1810 and John Claudius Loudon's Derby Arboretum opened in 1840, both of which were strongly associated with the activities of the Derby philosophers and helped to create a public platform for science.
In 1858, the Derby Philosophical Society moved to a house on the Wardwick in Derby as it merged with the Derby Town and County Museum and the Natural History Society. This move included the society's library of 4,000 volumes, Mathematical and scientific apparatus and its collection of fossils.

Vernon Oxford (b. June 8, 1941, Rogers, Arkansas) is an American country music singer and guitarist.
Biography.
Oxford was raised in Wichita, Kansas, where his father played old-time fiddle. He began playing professionally in Utah in 1960, mostly playing in the Kansas area in the early 1960s, then relocated to Nashville in 1964. In 1965 he met Harlan Howard, who got him signed to RCA Victor and helped him find material to record. He then released seven singles and one LP, "Woman Let Me Sing You a Song"; none of them charted, and he was soon dropped from RCA.
His career saw a resurgence in Britain, where he was first rediscovered in the middle of the 1970s. A best-of was issued there in 1974, and RCA signed him again to tour there. His hit singles "Shadows of My Mind", "Redneck (The Redneck National Anthem)", and "A Good Old Fashioned Saturday Night Honky Tonk Barroom Brawl" (U.S. Country No. 55, 1977) reinvigorated his career in America; in Britain, he was well known for "I've Got to Get Peter Off Your Mind" and "Field of Flowers". After a break of several years, he began a career as a gospel singer in 1981.

<doc id="21397373" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21397373" title="Gryllus veletis">
Gryllus veletis

Gryllus veletis, commonly known as the spring field cricket, is abundant throughout eastern North America. "G. veletis" is a solitary, aggressive, omnivorous, burrow-inhabiting species of field cricket. This species is commonly confused with "Gryllus pennsylvanicus" (fall field cricket), as they inhabit the same geographical area. However, the two species are easily distinguished through examination of life history, ovipositor and behavioural differences. Predators of "G. veletis", and most field crickets, include: American toads, wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, wolf spiders and the red back salamander.
Identification.
Adult body length measures approximately 22.0 mm (0.87 inches). Males of this species are black with dark brown or black appendages. Females are similar in colour and have a dark brown ovipositor, measuring approximately 14 mm (0.55 inches). Female colouration differs from males as they have lighter, more reddish legs.
All species of field crickets generally look similar, with minor distinctions in morphological characteristics (i.e. coloration, ovipositor length, etc.) aiding in species identification. However, the male cricket's song play an important role in species identification. For an individual cricket, the species specific song helps distinguish mates and conspecifics from other species of crickets that might reside in the area. A recording of the spring field cricket's song can be heard here.
Natural history.
Distribution.
"Gryllus veletis" is abundant throughout eastern North America. It ranges from southern Canada to northern Georgia, and as far west as Washington and Oregon "G. veletis" occurs in the same areas as "G. pennsylvanicus" but the spring field cricket does not reach as far north as Nova Scotia, Canada. "G. veletis" can be found in disturbed habitats such as old fields, and weedy roadsides.
Life cycle and mating behaviour.
Spring field crickets are sexually mature from late May to early August. Males of the species attract sexually receptive females by acoustic signals, known as stridulation. This process occurs by rubbing two rigid veins on the wings against one another. One vein is a "scraper" (smooth surface), the other a "file" (rough surface). The wings are held at a 45 degree angle above the thorax to amplify the sound.
Calling tends to peak at sunrise and lasts between 1.3 to 1.8 hours per night. However, if nighttime temperatures drop below 10 °C (50 °F), calling will switch to the daytime. At 29 °C (85 °F), the cricket will call at 120–370 chirps per minute, in a series of 3 to 5-pulse chirps. When a female is within the vicinity of a male’s territory, a quieter song (known as a courtship song) is used to reduce the risk of predation and attraction of male competitors. Both males and females have directional hearing. Tympanums on the front legs pick up the vibrations created by the chirps. Depending on the strength, and on which leg the vibration is received, the location of the caller can be determined.
Once mating occurs, females use their ovipositor to lay eggs into a soil substrate. The eggs will mature between June and September. The immature spring field cricket will continue to develop into a late-instar nymph and overwinter in this stage until emergence as adults in late May. "G. veletis" therefore undergoes one generation per year.
Human Impact.
Spring field crickets are often grouped with the other species of field crickets when discussing their possible impacts on humans.
Field crickets, including "G.veletis", are generally omnivorous scavengers. Their diet normally consists of plants, both fresh and decaying, other dead insects and in some cases predation of other field crickets or live insects may occur. An example of field cricket predation is seen in the consumption of fly pupae, which helps reduce the population of flies, often viewed as pests by humans. Consumption of plant matter helps ensure that fallen leaves and other material does not accumulate. Along with other scavengers (i.e. earthworm, beetles, etc.) decomposition of plants into fertile soil helps maintain a balanced ecosystem in forests and fields.
Unlike house crickets ("Acheta domesticus"), field crickets are not able to adapt to a residential environment due to constraints in their life history traits and consequently, the insect will not live through the winter.Though field crickets are not normally found in home environments, they may invade a home to seek refuge from poor weather, attraction to light, or in search of foodstuffs (i.e. grains, seeds, etc.). Entrance can be gained through small cracks and crevices leading into a building. Once inside, damage to nylon, wool, plastic and leather fabrics may occur. The field cricket does not consume these materials, but "cuts out" a path through which it may pass. The human inhabitant may be aggravated by the field cricket's nocturnal chirping.

Centre for the Advanced Study of the Arab World

The Centre for the Advanced Study of the Arab World (CASAW) (Arabic: مركز الدراسات المتقدمة للعالم العربي) is a government funded, research based initiative which is at the forefront of UK expertise in the Arab World.
Foundation.
CASAW is the result of a UK government initiative to build crucial expertise on the Arab World based on a knowledge of the Arabic language coupled with advanced research methods skills in the social and political sciences, arts and humanities.
The Centre is a collaborative initiative between the Universities of Edinburgh, Durham, and Manchester, and is funded by the joint government research councils, with an initial grant of £5 million.
CASAW is one of the five inter-instituitional Centres of Excellence set up as part of the ESRC, AHRC, SFC and HEFCE's Language Based Area Studies Initiative.[http://www.www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/opportunities/postgraduate/fundingopportunities/LanguageBasedAreaStudies.aspx?data=%2fFrXHTl993p9fjzYhY4Jyp6N9GDM4%2bsGMr4zAN9MeBebJCRMWx8UGeClgbbCt%2fMSBavp67PHdNm6zU6FRILDnl%2bL9ICVFyjiYSj4pawDdWnsg%2b6TIye5vnzc5NxsJ2AeZQ%2fAdZLGgRTGh6q3pd5U6%2bai5B7i5PHjhj5bvqwN%2b9V0TJn7smWQPQ%3d%3d&xu=0&isAwardHolder=&isProfiled=&AwardHolderID=&Sector] CASAW brings together some 50 full-time members of staff and postdoctoral fellows drawn from a variety of departments in the arts, humanities and social and political sciences, all working on areas directly related to the Arabic speaking world.
Objectives.
CASAW's aim is to ""serve national strategic interests by safeguarding the future health of Arab World expertise in the UK, training the next generation of academics and providing a vital flow of expertise to sustain the needs of the public and private sectors""
Additionally, the creation of the UK's leading resource for Arab World expertise, the creation of opportunities for academic cooperation and collaboration, as well as the creation of a world class cadre of researchers are key aims.
Masters and Doctoral Programmes.
CASAW offers a number of 2 year Masters and 4 year PhD awards. Regardless of the end qualification, all students who do not yet have Arabic expertise undertake a specially designed, intensive, one year course in Arabic language "ab initio" at the University of Edinburgh. This consists of a full academic year at the University of Edinburgh, followed by four months of language training in an Arab World university in order to develop Arabic language ability. During this time, students undertake qualitative, quantitative, and area-specific advanced research methods at the University of Edinburgh.
Masters students continue intensive Arabic tuition in their second year, and undertake additional modules at their host institution, as well as beginning dissertations.
PhD students are placed in the institution most appropriate for the supervision of their specific project, yet also benefit from some cross-institutional supervision. During the remaining 3 years of their course, PhD candidates continue to receive language tuition and are expected to conduct 12 months of fieldwork in the Arab World.
Other activities.
In addition to its academic obligations, CASAW undertakes a number other activities, including consultancy to government, media, and business, tailor made language programmes for public and private sector users, and flagship events. These events have included a partnership with the Royal Society of Edinburgh to present the lecture series entitled ""Perspectives on the Arab World"", a Careers Workshop for students of Arabic throughout the UK, an Islamic finance summer school, as well as numerous one day symposia, film showings, discussion groups and addresses from eminent politicians and public figures, as well as conferences, such as the international conference on “Re-Thinking Jihad” held 7–9 September 2009.

<doc id="21397446" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21397446" title="Free plan">
Free plan

The free plan, as it relates to architecture refers to an open plan with non load-bearing walls dividing interior space. In this structural system, the building structure is separate of the interior partitions. This is made possible by replacing interior load-bearing walls with moving the structure of the building to the exterior, or by having columns that are free from space dividing partitions.
Definition.
Free plan, in the architecture world, refers to the ability to have a floor plan with non-load bearing walls and floors by creating a structural system that holds the weight of the building by ways of an interior skeleton of load bearing columns. The building system carries only its columns, or skeleton, and each corresponding ceiling. Free plan allows for the ability to create buildings without being limited by the placement of walls for structural support, and enables an architect to have the freedom to design the outside and inside façade without compromise.
Influences.
Le Corbusier became the pioneer of free plan during the 1914 through 1930’s with his “Five Points of New Architecture” and his adoption of the Dom-ino System. This heavily influenced the importance of free plan and its role in the “modern era” of architecture.
Dom-ino Structural System.
The Dom-ino system refers to the structural system that allows a free floor and wall plan, due to the load bearing columns within the skeleton of the structure. Originally conceived as a two story building, six vertical columns held the two concrete, steel reinforced floors in space. This allowed for exterior walls that accommodate to the aesthetic and compositional features of the building. This also created a free floor plan, moving from the previous ideology of load bearing walls. This new technology allowed for long strips of windows that could wrap corners and stretch greater lengths, something that was never seen before in architecture. This building system became a staple for high production buildings because of its cheap and fast production rate. Ways could be fashioned in any way, restrained only by technological advancements of the time.
Corbusier and the Five Points of a New Architecture.
Corbusier adopted what he considered to be the most important five architectural points in his architecture: pilotis, free plan, horizontal windows, a free façade and roof top gardens. The ideas all surface around the main point of free plan and the use of the Dom-ino system. The piloti system carries all the weight allowing for a free plan as well as a free façade. The free exterior façade allowed for vast openings and horizontal strips of windows creating aesthetic value. All of the five points work together, being based off the premise of the Dom-ino system, varied to a degree for aesthetic purposes.
Examples.
Although Corbusier had become the pioneer of free plan in his own architecture, some other notable architects continued to follow in his footsteps, using free plan in their architecture as well. Two notable architects include Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe and Eduardo Catalano. Three of Van Der Rohe’s most notable buildings that portray the use of free plan are the Barcelona Pavilion and the New National Gallery in Berlin and the Crown Hall building at the Illinois Institute of Technology. All three of these buildings show great expanses in floor plan due to the freedom from use of free plan. Notably, the Barcelona Pavilion expresses free plan by having glass walls and large expanses and openings in the outside façade of the building. It also has a completely open free floor plan in the interior with sections divided by walls lower than ceiling height to distinguish rooms and areas, something that can be done in any fashion through the use of free plan.
Of Corbusier’s architecture, the Villa Savoye Poissy, demonstrates his five points in the most successful way, including free plan. By using free plan, the exterior façade of the building has large horizontal window bands to help achieve greater amounts of light reach the inside of the building. The interior also demonstrates free plan by not being limited by load bearing walls, but instead having large, openings and rooms in the inside façade of the building.
Eduardo Catalino achieves the ultimate free plan in his Catalano residence in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1955 by using thin shield concrete to achieve a completely free floor plan. By using the concrete in his roof, he designs a hyperbolic parabolic roof that is self-supporting with only two points touching the ground. No other points of contact support the roof. In doing this he achieves a floor plan that is completely independent of its roof structure. The roof stands by itself, and creates its own structure. This achieves, by definition, a completely independent free plan.

According to Goron and Goenka, Raja Ganesha seized control over Bengal soon after the death of Sultan Bayazid (1412–1414). Facing an imminent threat of invasion at the behest of a powerful Muslim holy man named Qutb al Alam, he appealed to the saint to call off his threat. The saint agreed on the condition that Raja Ganesha's son Jadu would convert to Islam and rule in his place. Raja Ganesha agreed and Jadu started ruling Bengal as "Jalal al-Din" in 1415 AD. Nur Qutb died in 1416 AD and Raja Ganesha was emboldened to depose his son and accede to the throne himself as "Danujamarddana Deva". Jalaluddin was reconverted to Hinduism by the Golden Cow ritual. After the death of his father he once again converted to Islam and started ruling his second phase.
Second phase (1418-1433).
Jalaluddin maintained a peaceful kingdom during his second phase. His authority stretched to eastern Bengal Moazzamabad (present-day Sunamganj) and south-eastern Bengal (present-day Chittagong). He also conquered Fathabad (present-day Faridpur) and the southern Bengal. During his reign Firuzabad Pandua became a populous and flourshing town. It is recorded in the "Ming shi" that a Chinese explorer, Cheng Ho, visited the city twice in 1421-22 and 1431-33. He later transferred the capital from Pandua to Gaur. The city of Gaur began to be re-populated during his reign. Jalaluddin himself constructed a number of buildings and "sarais" there.
Relation with non-Muslims.
He maintained good rapport with Non-Muslims in his kingdom. According to an interpretation of a Sanskrit sloka by D. C. Bhattacharya, Jalaluddin appointed Rajyadhar, a Hindu, as the commander of his army. He gained support of Muslim scholars - "Ulama" and the "Shaikhs". He reconstructed and repaired the mosques and other religious architectures destroyed by Raja Ganesha. 17th century Persian historian, Firishta, applauded him by saying: 
He upheld the principles of justice and equity and became the Naushirwan of the age.
His remark is corroborated by the evidence of the "Smritiratnahara" and the "Padachandrika". According to the "Padachandrika", a commentary on the Amarakosha in Sanskrit, Brihaspati Mishra, a Brahmin from Kulingram (present-day Bardhaman district), was promoted by Sultan Jalaluddin to the position of the "Sarvabhaumapandita" (Court Scholar). And Vishvasrai, son of Brihaspati Mishra, was also appointed a minister by the Sultan. But according to a 19th-century chronicle written by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, Jalaluddin compelled many Hindus to convert to Islam, resulting in many Hindus fleeing to Kamrup.
Relation with foreign rulers.
He also maintained good diplomatic relations. He was in correspondence with the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh of Herat, Yung Le of China and al-Ashraf Barsbay, the Mamluk ruler of Egypt. Ibrahim Sharqi attacked his kingdom but censure from Yung Le and Shah Rukh caused him to withdraw. Jalaluddin helped Meng Soamun Narmeikhla, King of Arakan, to recover his kingdom from Burma; in return he became the overlord of Arakan. He, at some point, also ruled over parts of Tripura and southern Bihar. 
Jalaluddin tried to legitimize his rule by publicly displaying his credentials as a devout and correct Muslim. Contemporary Arab sources hold that upon his conversion to Islam, Jalaluddin adopted the Hanafi legal tradition. Between 1428-31, he also supported the construction of a religious college in Mecca and established close ties with Barsbay. With the exchange of gifts, Jalaluddin requested in return a letter of recognition from the Egyptian Mamluk Sultan. Barsbay was the most prestigious Muslim ruler in the Islamic heartlands and the custodian of a remnant line of the Abbasid caliphs. The Mamluk Sultan complied with the request by sending him a robe of honor and the letter of recognition. In 1427, Jalaluddin described himself in an inscription as "Al-sultan al-azam al-muazzamin khalifat Allah 'ali al-makunin Jalal al-Dunya w’al-Din" (the most exalted of the great sultans, the caliph of Allah in the universe).
Coins.
Several undated issues of his silver coins and a huge commemorative silver coin minted at in Pandua in 1421, bear the stylized figure of a lion, the vehicle of the Goddess Chandi.
Another theory says that they were issued to celebrate the arrival of a Chinese ambassador and yet another theory says that they marked the withdrawal of Jaunpur's threatening army. Regardless, they are the most unusual and were copied by two later Bengal sultans and by the kings of Tripura. In 1430, he included "Khalifat al-Allah" (the caliph of Allah) as one of his titles on his coins. In 1431 AD he issued a new coin inscribing Kalema-tut-shahadat. Thus he reintroduced on his coins the Kalimah, which had disappeared from Bengal Sultanate coins for several centuries.
He died in Rabi 2, 837 AH (1433 AD) and was buried in Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua.

Tom Walker (1970s pitcher)

Robert Thomas Walker (born November 7, 1948) is a former professional baseball pitcher. Walker pitched all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1972 until 1977, for the Montreal Expos, Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Cardinals and California Angels.
Baseball career.
Tom posted an 18-23 record in the majors. However his greatest feat came in the minor leagues in 1971, when he played for Cal Ripken Sr. in the Texas League and threw a 15-inning no-hitter for the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs to beat the Albuquerque Dodgers 1-0. He threw 193 pitches to win the game. The last batter he faced in the majors, Lyman Bostock, lined into a triple play.
Brush with death.
In 1972, while playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, Tom helped Roberto Clemente load a plane carrying relief supplies to survivors of a massive earthquake in Nicaragua after Christmas. He offered to accompany Clemente on the trip to the Central American nation, but the plane was full and Clemente told him to stay behind and enjoy his New Year's Eve. A few hours later, Tom returned to his condo and saw the news reports that Clemente's plane had crashed off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico; he probably would have died in the crash if it weren't for Clemente's decision.
Personal.
Tom's son, Neil Walker, currently plays for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Another son, Matt, played in the minor leagues as an outfielder in the Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles systems, while another son, Sean, pitched for George Mason University. Tom is also the brother-in-law of former Montreal Expos pitcher, Chip Lang. Meanwhile Don Kelly, a utility player for the Tigers, married his daughter Carrie, a former professional basketball player, in 2007.

Vienna 1873 chess tournament

The Vienna 1873 chess tournament was a side event of the world exhibition of 1873 (the fifth since the first Great Exhibition in London in 1851).
Background.
The fair was held in the Prater in Vienna, and opened in the Rotunde on May 1. Companies of all 35 participating countries presented their state of the art products and inventions. The world exhibitions aimed to promote international trading relations and to propagate the technical and cultural progress.
Austria-Hungary aimed to present itself as a world leader and the equal of England and France, and had the intention to show the new Vienna (buildings of the Ringstrasse, parks). Unfortunately, the stock exchange crashed on May 9 (see Panic of 1873), and cholera plagued the city from July to September. Finally many guests visited the fair in October and November.
The Chess tournament.
During the epidemic, the tournament took place in the rooms of the "Wiener Schachgesellschaft" from June 21 to August 29. The time limit was twenty moves per hour. It was a twelve player tournament. Each participant played every other for a match for two points with a maximum of three games. There were eleven rounds of match competitions. Every short match had to be ended within two days. If the overall score gave no winner (1:1,=1 or 0:0,=3), the result was drawn with a half point given to each player. Wilhelm Steinitz won the tournament after a play-off with Joseph Henry Blackburne (2–0). Almost everyone now conceded that Steinitz was the strongest chess player in the world.
Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria, Baron Albert Salomon von Rothschild and Baron Ignaz von Kolisch contributed large sums to the prize fund. The prizes winners were: Steinitz 10 points & winner of playoff (1000 guldens (F) & 200 golden ducats), Blackburne 10 points (600 F), Anderssen 8½ points (300 F), Rosenthal 7½ points (200 F). Scores of the other players were: Paulsen and Bird 6½, Fleissig and Meitner 3½, Heral, Schwarz and Gelbfuhs 3, Pitschel 1.

<doc id="21397605" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21397605" title="Saxa Rubra">
Saxa Rubra

Saxa Rubra was a village and station on the Roman Flaminian Way, from Rome, Italy.
It is now the name of a neighborhood north of Rome and of the city's Roma Nord railway station. Situated on the modern Via Flaminia it is also the site of a major RAI public service broadcaster center.
The area derived its name from the redness of the tuff rocks, which are still conspicuous around Prima Porta and Grottarossa, both of which have been identified as the current site of Saxa Rubra (Grottarossa, meaning "red cave").
History.
The name is written Ad Rubras in the Peutingeriana Tabula, while Martial calls the place simply Rubrae. This form of the name is also found in the Jerusalem Itinerary although the proper reference appears to have been Saxa Rubra, which is used both by Livy and Cicero. The former mentions it during the wars between Rome and Veii, in connection with the operations on the Cremera (Liv. ii. 49); and Cicero notes it as a place in the immediate vicinity of Rome, where Marcus Antonius halted before entering the city. (Cic. "Phil." ii. 3. 1) It was also here that Antonius, Vespasian's general, arrived on his march upon Rome, when he learned of the successes of the Vitellians and the death of Sabinus. (Tac. "Hist." iii. 79.) At a much later period (312) it was also the point to which Maxentius advanced to meet Constantine previous to the battle at the Milvian bridge. (Vict. "Caes." 40. § 23.) Martial ("l. c.") states that a village had grown up on the spot, as would naturally be the case with a station so immediately in the neighborhood of the city.
On a hill on the right of the Via Flaminia, a little beyond Prima Porta, are considerable ruins, which are believed to be those of the villa of Livia, known by the name of "Ad Gallinas", which was situated from Rome, on the Via Flaminia. (Plin. xv. 30. s. 40; Suet. "Galb." 1.)

David Lamming

David W. Lamming (birth registered January→March 1936 — ) birth registered in Wakefield district, was a professional rugby league footballer of the 1950s and '60s, and coach of the 1980s, playing at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Juniors), and Wakefield Trinity, as a , i.e. number 13, and coaching at club level for Wakefield Trinity.
Contemporaneous Article Extract.
"Outlines - On David Lamming "Our spotlight again falls upon one of the many local products in our present side; one whose promise was seen in schoolboy football and developed in our own "nursery" teams. David Lamming's career began at Snapethorpe School, and it was soon evident that he was a "natural" loose-forward. He was a regular choice for the Wakefield City team and his work with them gained recognition by the County. He represented Yorkshire Boys against Cumberland and Lancashire. He came to Belle Vue and was brought along in our own Trinity Juniors team, and from there he was signed in December, 1953. After a number of "A" team appearances he made his senior debut against Keighley on April 10, 1954. He was then eighteen, and although there were only two other senior appearances for him that term, he was brought along gradually into senior company during the next campaign and shared selection at loose-forward with Colin Clifft. Unfortunately, just when he had gained permanent selection in our senior ranks, he was called away on National Service with the Army. This meant, a complete season from our first team but, on his return in 1958, he was soon in action again, and made 21 appearances. Around this time, however, Trinity's pack was being strengthened with experienced internationals. For Lamming it meant that a new challenge had to begin; and he was young enough and keen enough to accept this in the right spirit. He has come back to be a regular contender for a pack berth and, at the same time, his talents at loose-forward have been valuable when called in to deputise for Derek Turner when Trinity's captain has had international calls. He is now nearing his century of appearances for the first team and there is proof there of the experience he has gained in these recent years. he is still only 24 years of age; young enough to be one of the forwards on which Trinity's future is to be built, and with the ability for that to be done confidently. His career, in fact can hold much for the seasons ahead.""

David R. Godine, Publisher

David R. Godine, Publisher is an American book publishing company, founded in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts by David R. Godine. Many of the early titles were fine letterpress editions, using a 40" Kelly-3 flatbed reciprocating letterpress with three form rollers. The company has since grown to become a well-regarded, small, general trade publisher. The press now publishes between twenty and forty titles annually, with an eclectic list that ranges from literary fiction in translation to illustrated books on gardening. Acquisitions are driven by the tastes and passions of David R. Godine, the founder and still-active president. Several of those earliest editions are now considered collector's items, including Arthur Freeman's "Assays of Bias", Andrew Marvell's "Garden" (printed on a Vandercook press #20), and Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience" and "A Plea for Captain John Brown."
By 1975, the firm had abandoned letterpress printing and decided to focus its energies entirely on publishing. The early lists followed very much the same patterns as those of the next three decades, concentrating primarily on the founder's broad interests: fiction (especially in translation), biography, photography, the history of printing and the graphic arts, and children's books. Over the next thirty years, a number of series were created. The Nonpareil Books collection, which now numbers over 100 titles in print, brings back neglected works; Over its life the series has revived books by writers as varied as Donald Hall, William Maxwell, Francis Steegmuller, George Orwell, Laurie Lee, Will Cuppy, Flora Thompson and Gerald Durrell. The Verba Mundi series concentrates on translations of foreign fiction and has included the work of Dino Buzzati, Robert Musil, Georges Perec, and the 2000 Nobel Prize Laureate J. M. G. Le Clézio. The Imago Mundi series of finely printed illustrated books, primarily photography, has promoted work by artists as varied as Paul Caponigro, George Tice, Angus McBean and Jean Cocteau. The small format Pocket Paragons concentrate on illustrated books by authors and artsists as diverse as Marie Angel, William Heath Robinson, Lotte jacobi and Margaret Bourke-White. 
Both the press and its authors have won prestigious awards over the years, including the W.A. Dwiggins Award in 1984, the Boston Globe Literary Press Award in 1987, and the first New England Booksellers Annual Award in 1989. In 2008, J.M.G. Le Clézio, the author of "The Prospector" (Godine, 1993), was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, Godine published Le Clézio's acclaimed novel Desert in the Spring of 2009.
In 2002, John Martin, in a gentleman's agreement with David R. Godine, sold the rights, remaining stock, and back list of titles for Black Sparrow Press to David R. Godine, Publisher — this did not include Black Sparrow's most popular authors, however: Charles Bukowski, John Fante, Wyndham Lewis, and Paul Bowles. Since that time, the editors at Godine have added authors Eddie Chuculate, Kenneth Burke, Daniel Fuchs, and Linda Bamber to the Black Sparrow imprint, brought several titles by Charles Reznikoff back into print, and continued to publish and republish existing Black Sparrow authors, such as Wanda Coleman and Lyn Lifshin.
As a small, independent publisher Godine has maintained focus on areas for which the company has become known—books that demonstrate fine design and uphold production values. Godine's children's list is especially notable, with authors and illustrators as diverse as William Steig, Mary Azarian, Barbara McClintock, Joe McKendry, and Edward Ardizzone. Every year the firm issues between twenty and forty new titles and also reprints roughly the same number.

Sir Thomas Allin, 1st Baronet

Sir Thomas Allin, 1st Baronet (1612–1685) was an officer of the Royal Navy who saw service in the English Civil War, and the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars. A Royalist during the Civil War, he returned to service after the Restoration and eventually rose to the rank of Admiral after serving under some of the most distinguished military figures of the era, including Prince Rupert of the Rhine.
Family and early life.
Thomas Allin was born in 1612, the son of Robert Allin. He lived in Lowestoft for the first part of his life, where he was a merchant and shipowner. On the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, Allin sided with the Royalists, in common with most of the town. He played a significant part in the subsequent privateering operations against Lowestoft's Parliamentarian rivals at Great Yarmouth, and eventually transferred his operations to the Netherlands for greater security. He remained in the service of Prince Rupert of the Rhine in the exiled royalist fleet after the Civil War, as evidenced by the issuing of "Prince Rupert's Further Instructions for Captain Thomas Allen" . He commanded the Royalists' "Charles" in 1648 until her capture in 1649, and subsequently commanded the "Convertine" in 1650. Allin was rewarded for his loyalty to the monarchy after the English Restoration by being given command of on 24 June 1660. He went on to command and during 1661, during 1662 and during 1663. During 1663 he was made commander in chief in the Downs with the rank of commodore, flying his pennant aboard from 15 April 1664.
Command.
In 1664 Allin was nominated to succeed Sir John Lawson as commander in the Mediterranean, and sailed to take up his command aboard the "Plymouth" from 26 June, and in company with . He operated out of Tangiers initially, and while operating in the Straits of Gibraltar he and his fleet intercepted and engaged the Dutch Smyrna fleet on 9 December, capturing and sinking several of the Dutch ships. Allin returned to England in the spring of 1665, and took part in the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665. For his achievements he was awarded a knighthood on 24 June and was appointed an Admiral of the Blue squadron under the Earl of Sandwich. He flew his flag in from 19 July 1665 and became an Admiral of the White on 16 March 1666. Prince Rupert then came aboard, with orders to take the squadron into the English Channel to intercept a French fleet believed to sailing up the Channel to join with the Dutch. Rupert retained Allin as his first captain for this assignment, but the intelligence was proved to be false, and no French fleet was found. By now though the rest of the English fleet under the Duke of Albemarle had sailed out to engage a Dutch fleet under Michiel de Ruyter, and the Four Days Battle had broken out. Rupert and Allin hurried back and met up with the harried and outnumbered English fleet on the third day, managing to hold the Dutch off long enough to allow a successful disengagement and then covering the retreat.
The next engagement with the Dutch fleet took place on 4 August 1666, at the St. James's Day Battle. Allin was in command of the van squadron, and led the attack, engaging the Dutch van throughout the day, and chasing them from the battle scene the following day, greatly contributing to the English victory. Allin was then placed in command of a squadron off Dungeness, and on 17 September he captured the French ship "Rubis", which was taken into service as . Allin's next command was to take over the Mediterranean forces in 1668, after the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and to operate against the Barbary corsairs. A treaty was duly signed with the Algerians, but by 1669 Allin was employed again in chastising the pirates for breaches of the treaty, during which time he captured and destroyed a large number of pirate vessels. He returned to England after this and on 15 April 1671 he became Comptroller of the Navy, a post he held throughout the Third Anglo-Dutch War and continued to hold until 28 January 1680. On 7 February 1673 Allin was created a baronet for his services. He briefly returned to active service in 1678 when the threat of war with France emerged, and Allin became commander in chief of the fleet in the Narrow Seas, with as his flagship. He resigned the command once the threat of war had passed.
Later life.
Allin retired from active service in 1678, settling at his country seat at Somerleyton Hall, Somerleyton. He also served as Captain of Sandgate Castle, and a Master of Trinity House. He died in 1685, and was buried in the parish church at Somerleyton on 5 October 1685. He had been twice married, his first marriage producing his son and heir Thomas Allin, and two daughters, and his second marriage produced another daughter.

Pinkney City, Washington

Pinkney City or Pinkneyville was a small community outside of Fort Colville in what is now Stevens County (Washington). Originally named for Colonel Pinkney Lugenbeel, commander at the fort in the early 1860s. The town grew up around the fort around 1861, and eventually became Colville.
The civilian town just north of the military base soon became an important trading center and eventually the county seat for what would later become Stevens County. In 1863 the residents of Pinkney city petitioned the legislature to make Stevens County part of Spokane County. Instead Spokane was made part of Stevens County, and the county seat was moved (this was later split into Okanogan, Spokane and Stevens Counties). After the fort was abandoned in the 1880s, the town of Colville moved some three miles away, and Pinkney City disappeared.

Rhys ap Rhydderch

Rhys ap Rhydderch was the brother of Gruffydd ap Rhydderch, king of Deheubarth from 1044 to 1055. Both were the sons of Rhydderch ab Iestyn, who had been able to take over the Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth from 1023 to 1033. 
By 1045, he and his brother had secured control of Morgannwg, and the native chronicles mention that in 1045 the two brothers performed some treacherous action against Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, the king of Gwynedd and Powys. The exact nature of this treachery is not specified, however. Although both Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and the brothers were rivals to rule Deheubarth, in the end, the two brothers became the rulers of the disputed territory. In 1049, Gruffydd ap Rhydderch joined with an Irish and Viking raiding party that raided England. Probably, Rhys was with his brother on this raid into England. The raid was opposed by Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, but the English forces were betrayed by Welsh soldiers serving with the English army, and the Welsh and Viking raiders defeated Ealdred's defenders.
King Edward the Confessor of England ordered the killing of Rhys in reprisal for his raiding of England, the decision being made at the royal court held at Christmas, 1052. Rhys was killed, according to the D version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", because he "did harmful things". The chronicle of Florence of Worcester recorded a bit more information, stating that Rhys was killed at "Bulendun", which may be Bullen's Bank near Clyro in Radnorshire.
After his death, Rhys' head was brought to King Edward on 5 January 1053. This left his brother as the only ruler in Deheubarth, but this did not last long, as around 1055, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn attacked the south and killed Gruffydd ap Rhydderch. This left Gruffydd ap Llywelyn as the sole ruler of Wales, the first Welshman to be so.

<doc id="21397857" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21397857" title="Co-carcinogen">
Co-carcinogen

A Co-carcinogen is a chemical that promotes the effects of a carcinogen in the production of cancer. Usually, the term is used to refer to chemicals that are not carcinogenic on their own, such that an equivalent amount of the chemical is insufficient to initiate carcinogenesis. A chemical can be co-carcinogenic with other chemicals or with nonchemical carcinogens, such as UV radiation.
For example, sodium arsenite can be administered to mice at a low enough concentration that it does not cause tumors on its own, but it increases the rate of formation and size of tumors formed after UV exposure.
A chemical may act as a co-carcinogen even if it does not cause direct DNA damage such as mutation, as long as it can affect a cancer-related pathway. An example of this category includes chemicals within the phorbol ester family, which mimic a native signalling molecule. This ester is not mutagenic, but can increase the rate of cancer by promoting cell growth, a traditional hallmark of cancer.
A chemical may both have anti-carcinogenic properties and yet still be a co-carcinogen in combination with some carcinogens. Additionally, the carcinogenic modifying ability of a chemical can often be dose dependent, where low doses of the compound produce beneficial (or at least non-harmful) results (as in hormesis) while higher doses can lead to a toxic effect.
Evidence points to beta carotene being one example of such a compound, which has led researchers to caution against the emphasis on isolated dietary supplements and instead recommend a focus on promoting a diverse diet rich in fruits and vegetables.

Portrait of a Cardinal (Raphael)

The Portrait of a Cardinal is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It is housed in the Prado Museum in Madrid. 
The Cardinal has been identified as either Alidosi, Bibbiena, Cybo or Trivulzio, in the court of Pope Julius II. 
Painted in Rome, Rafael mastered the art of realism in his paintings, the ability to “paint people as more real than they really are,” as his peers put it. 
Like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, the subject is seated, with formation of a triangle pyramid by the subjects' body and arms. The contrasts are striking between the red of his hat, whiteness of his sleeve and his face. Meticulous brushstrokes give the audience a three-dimensional character, revealing Rapahel’s interest in sculpture during those years. 
While still a prince, the painting was acquired by Carlos IV of Spain (1748–1819) in Rome. 
The picture was attributed to Antonio Moro, due to its technique, considered unusual in Raphael.

Ohio League

The Ohio League was an informal and loose association of American football clubs active between 1903 and 1919 that competed for the Ohio Independent Championship (OIC). As the name implied, its teams were mostly based in Ohio. It is the direct predecessor to the modern National Football League (NFL).
A proposal to add teams from outside Ohio, such as the Latrobe Athletic Association, to form a formal league known as the "Football Association" fell through prior to the 1904 season.
Though a champion was declared by the group throughout its existence, a formal league was not founded until 1920, when several Ohio League teams added clubs from other states to form the American Professional Football Association. In 1922, the APFA became the National Football League.

Joseph Abruzzo

Joseph Abruzzo (born August 14, 1980) is a Democratic member of the Florida Senate, representing the 25th District, which includes most of Palm Beach County, since 2012.
History.
Abruzzo graduated from Lynn University with a degree in international communications in 2003, and joined the United States Coast Guard Reserve later that year, where he worked as a port security specialist. In 2006, he ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 86th District, but he lost to Maria Sachs in the Democratic primary. Abruzzo ran for the House again in 2008, but instead, in the 85th District. He was unopposed in the primary, and, in the general election, defeated the Republican nominee, Howard K. Coates, Jr., an attorney. Abruzzo was narrowly re-elected in 2010, defeating Tami L. Donnally.
Florida Senate.
In 2012, Abruzzo ran for the Florida Senate from the newly created 25th District. In a race that was targeted by the Republican Party of Florida as a potential pick-up opportunity, Abruzzo faced off against Melanie Peterson, an agricultural activist and horse broker."The Palm Beach Post", largely due to his opposition to Governor Rick Scott's proposal to eliminate the corporate income tax, endorsed Abruzzo over Peterson, and the "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", citing his "independent streak" and his record of "working with Republicans as a moderate Democrat," endorsed Abruzzo as well. In the end, the 25th District overwhelmingly elected Abruzzo, who won over Peterson with 57% of the vote.
Abruzzo sponsored legislation that would allow "a not-for-profit insurance company, like Florida Blue, to become a so-called 'mutual insurance holding company,'" which "would allow the company to own other not-for-profit insurers and corporations in Florida, which is not allowed under current law," and the legislation passed unanimously through the Florida Senate without debate. He also authored legislation with State Representative Dave Kerner that would "sever the parental rights of a rapist if a child is conceived as a result of the attack," as, in some cases, rapists could sue for custody of children that were the products of the rapes that they committed. Additionally, Abruzzo worked with State Representative Joe Saunders to propose the Competitive Workforce Act, which would "update the state's Civil Rights Act of 1992 to include protections against discrimination for reasons of sexual orientation and gender identity," which a University of Florida poll suggested that 73 percent of Floridians supported. He joined forces with State Representative Irving Slosberg to author legislation that would create a "yellow dot program," whereby drivers of cars would put a photograph of themselves and "identifying information, along with any relevant medical records" into the glovebox of their car, and would affix a "circular, yellow decal" on their cars so that, in the case of a car accident, first responders would know to look in the glovebox for the information, which could prove helpful in treating the driver, if injured. However, Abruzzo opposed controversial legislation referred to as the "parent trigger bill," whereby parents could "demand sweeping changes at struggling public schools, including having the school converted into a charter school," and the legislation ultimately failed.

Abortion in Namibia is restricted under the Abortion and Sterilisation Act of South Africa (1975), which Namibia inherited at the time of Independence from South Africa in March 1990. Abortions are allowed only when continuing the pregnancy will "endanger the woman’s life or constitute a serious threat to her physical or mental health or there must be a serious risk that the child to be born will suffer from a physical or mental defect so as to be irreparably seriously handicapped, when the foetus is alleged to have been conceived in consequence of unlawful carnal intercourse (rape or incest); or when the foetus has been conceived in consequence of illegitimate carnal intercourse and the woman is, owing to a permanent mental handicap or defect, unable to comprehend the implications of or bear the parental responsibility for the “fruit of coitus”."
The act also allows for the termination of a pregnancy in cases of rape or incest.In addition to the woman’s doctor, two other doctors are required to certify the existence of grounds for an abortion and the operation must be performed by a medical practitioner in a State hospital or an approved medical facility."
In a statement at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, then Minister of Health and Social Services Nickey Iyambo stated that 
On the question of abortion, the position of Namibia is that it can only be performed under strict medical supervision within the confines of the laws, which state that consent to abortion can only be given in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen it must be clearly understood that Namibia does not promote abortion as a means of family planning but as a public health issue.

<doc id="21397938" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21397938" title="Virtual law firm">
Virtual law firm

A virtual law firm is a legal practice that does not have a bricks-and-mortar office, but operates from the homes or satellite offices of its lawyers, usually delivering services to clients at a distance using technological means of communication. Most have a central function responsible for the accounting and administrative side of the practice. Virtual law firms are formed and regulated in the same way as traditional law firms, but their lawyers may be self-employed consultants rather than partners or employees.
History.
The first recorded virtual law firm was "Woolley & Co" set up in 1996 in England by Andrew Woolley. The term became more clearly defined in 2004 in an article written by Joe Kashi defining exactly what it meant to be a virtual law firm. Virtual law firms are also often referred to as "Law Firm 2.0". The concept has since spread globally and is finding favour with clients seeking higher quality service, value, and mobility.
Features.
According to earlier sources, a virtual law firm shares the following characteristics:
Benefits.
The advent of technology used in virtual law firms such as project management software, Virtual Law Offices and cloud computing have made it far easier for legal practices to save and manage data across geographic locations securely and efficiently and to communicate with clients at a distance, so that proximity to the client, or of the lawyers to each other in an office, has become far less important.
The virtual law firm has also come to be associated with lower prices, as they generally operate with lower overheads than traditional law firms. Lawyers find they can bill fewer hours but still make more money via a virtual firm because of the lower overheads.
Virtual law firms frequently have only senior lawyers, capable of working without much day-to-day supervision, unlike the traditional large law firm with its hierarchy of partners, associates and trainees. Many clients see a benefit in having their work done personally by an experienced lawyer, rather than having it delegated to a junior and then checked by a partner.
There are also environmental benefits to virtual law firms, many which operate as paperless offices in contrast to the traditional law firm with its rooms full of filing cabinets.
eLawyering and the Virtual Law Office.
More recently, the concept of the virtual law firm has been associated with the term, "eLawyering" referring to a law firm that delivers legal services online, either directly to consumers through their law firm websites or through legal matching platforms. The eLawyering Task Force of the Law Practice Management Section of the American Bar Association has released a statement on minimum requirements for law firms delivering legal service online. The guidelines equate the concept of "eLawyering" with the virtual practice of law and the concept of the virtual law firm. According to the American Bar Association guidelines, eLawyering or virtual law practice refers specifically to the delivery of legal services online through a section of a law firm's website that is a known as a secure "client portal." Under this definition, a "virtual law firm" is not simply a lawyer who does not have a physical office and communicates with clients by email. Instead, the law firm must have a secure section of its website where a client can log in with a unique user name and password.
The purpose of the eLawyering Task Force minimum requirements is to provide guidance to attorneys who wish to deliver legal services online on how to comply with the professional rules of conduct that govern law practice in each U.S. state. Conducting business through a log-in portal is different from conducting business over email, as the log-in portal is required to be secure and must adhere to strict regulations and standards. A completely virtual law office will conduct all business online, while some small practices choose to integrate a VLO log-in portal to provide more options to their clients.
A Virtual Law Office, or VLO, is an online law practice that exists through a secure log-in portal and can be accessed by both client and attorney anywhere an internet connection is available. In contrast to a traditional law practice, a VLO allows attorneys and clients to communicate securely over the internet, download or upload documents, and conduct other business normally conducted face-to-face over the internet.
The features offered by a virtual law office depend on the particular vendor, but basic features centre around a securely hosted, web-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that stores documents as part of a cloud computing system. By storing documents and information on an external server and allowing log-in through a secure, encrypted portal, documents can be accessed and shared by client and attorney.
A VLO allows clients and their attorneys to message and communicate securely, schedule appointments online, and upload and download documents. Attorneys running a VLO can also sync their firm’s calendars, sell documents online, and use a “virtual receptionist” service to handle administrative tasks. Attorneys also save on paper and printing costs by providing documents online, and both parties can access the VLO portal at any time of day. 
The main benefit of a virtual law office to the client is convenience and accessibility to the lawyer. The unbundled legal services of a VLO can also save clients a considerable amount of money by allowing them to handle much of the work surrounding their legal consultation themselves, with an attorney guiding them and drafting paperwork (known as “unbundling”). In turn, an attorney running a VLO will have more flexible work hours and be able to serve a much larger client base over the internet. They will also save significant overhead related to running a practice (such as office rent, paper, and assisting staff). With the rapid expansion of technology and internet use, lawyers who are able to bend their practice to serve this client base may find themselves more successful.
By 2014, there are at least 15 virtual law firms in the United States with more than 5 members and even more in Britain. An association of virtual law firms is being formed, Virtual Law Firm Association International http://vlfai.com/ so that interested parties can exchange information and promote the business model.

Simon Ellis (film director)

Simon Ellis is a British film director and winner of the International Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, the BIFA, and nominations for the BAFTA and European Film Awards for short film.
Background.
Ellis shot and processed his first black and white photographs aged sixteen, drifting away from charcoal and paintbrushes to the camera as his format of choice. Throughout his subsequent art studies in Coventry, Birmingham and eventually Nottingham, he focused on stills photography. After graduating in Fine Art (specifically Fine Art photography) and having worked as a camera operator on fellow students' film projects, Ellis wrote a handful of short scripts and started working as a volunteer at the now-defunct Intermedia Film and Video in Nottingham, providing access to camera and editing facilities. He also freelanced as a storyboard artist and occasional graphic designer, learning his filmmaking craft while working as camera operator or editor on an abundance of commissioned short films within Nottingham's thriving scene.
Films.
Ellis has received numerous international film festival awards while occasionally directing music videos, television shows and commercials. His films are perhaps best characterised by their diversity in both genre and medium, including drama, comedy, experimental, documentary and animation. 
"Ellis comes out of a strong tradition of regional British filmmaking. He is a very resourceful filmmaker who had embraced a DIY ethic even before digital technology made that option straightforward. Most importantly, he's an actor's director, and his ability to draw out convincing performances, often from inexperienced young actors and non-professionals, makes his films powerful, whatever the genre" (Shots magazine)
"Soft", commissioned by Film 4 and UK Film Council’s Cinema Extreme scheme won thirty-eight festival prizes including the International Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Best Short Film at the British Independent Film Awards, and both BAFTA and European Film Awards nominations. 
"I came across a short film recently which blew everything else I had seen that week out of the water. After it was over, there was no question of doing anything other than lying on the sofa with a cushion on my face, whimpering in fear and paranoia. 'Soft' is shocking and violent, and ingeniously, intimately upsetting in a way I can only compare to the controversial scenes in Gaspar Noé's Irréversible. The film reminded me of an essay I read by the late Alexander Walker about Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange: that the film was not merely about violence but about something deeper, darker, more unsayable: a fear of our children, and older people's fear and hatred of the young." (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian)
Over a dozen retrospectives of Ellis' eclectic catalogue have been presented at film festivals in Japan, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Romania, Netherlands and the UK. He continues to attend many festivals as either filmmaker or juror and persists working with the short form despite beginning a career in feature films. 
The films 'Telling Lies' and 'Soft' both feature on the Cinema 16 DVD collection, on 'British Short Films' and 'World Short Films', respectively. Alongside short films by Ridley Scott, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo Del Toro, Mike Leigh, Lynne Ramsay and many others, Ellis is the only director to feature twice in the series.
Music Videos.
In a major collaboration with UK beatboxing champion and loop pedal artist The Petebox, Ellis directed a video for every track from the album Future Loops for an innovative dual CD/DVD album campaign. Each video is a single-take documentary of the live recordings, initially released virally in chronological album order via YouTube, amassing millions of views. He has also directed two environmental binaural recording documentaries with Swimming.
Commercial Work.
Ellis' occasional foray into commercials include his multi-narrative, interactive anti-knife crime campaign films Choose a Different Ending and Who Killed Deon, which won over sixty awards, including several golds and the inaugural Grand Prix for Good at the Cannes Lions, plus golds at the Clio Awards, and the British Television Advertising Awards. Ellis was bestowed with the Young Director Award for Best European Web Film for Choose a Different Ending and Who Killed Deon was ranked 'most awarded TV campaign in the world' by Campaign magazine in January 2012.
"In these days of violence and shocking gornography, it's hard to be sickened by anything on TV - but when the stabbed guy realises he's dying (if you choose that option), my stomach turned. Great filming, great acting, great work." (Noel Bussey, Campaign)

John Peavey

John Peavey (born September 1, 1933) is a rancher and Democratic politician from Carey, Idaho. Peavey served in the Idaho Senate from 1969 to 1976 and from 1978 to 1994.
From a young age Peavey worked on the ranch founded by his grandfather, U.S. Senator John W. Thomas. In 1969 he succeeded his mother, Mary Brooks in the Idaho Senate as a Republican after she was appointed director of the United States Mint by President Richard M. Nixon.
In 1974, after repeated attempts to pass a Sunshine Law; a law requiring lobbyists to register and political campaign disclosure, in the legislature were unsuccessful, Peavey led a successful state wide campaign to pass one by ballot initiative. The passage of the act angered state GOP party officials who recruited a Rupert farmer to run against him in the 1976 Republican primary. When the opponent won, Peavey switched parties and ran as a Democrat in 1978 and won back his seat. In the early and mid-1990s he served as the Idaho Senate Minority Caucus Chairman. As a state senator, Peavey was noted for rarely appearing in public without wearing a cowboy hat.
In 1994 Peavey was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. He was defeated by the Republican incumbent Butch Otter, who was later elected governor in 2006.

Modern Timber Homes

Modern Timber Homes was an Irish business established in 2004 by Shaun McColgan. It built timber frame homes, roof trusses and door systems from a premises, where it employed twenty people.
The business was located at Crossan Business Park Bonagee in Letterkenny County Donegal.
Funded partly by the enterprise board, the business was highly successful, employing several natives and providing much needed local income.
In 2006, the company won the main award at the National Enterprise Awards ceremony for its focus on ecologically-friendly homes. However this joy was short lived as in June 2008 the award-winning Donegal timber frame manufacturer sought protection from its creditors after running into financial difficulties. Modern Timber Homes petitioned the High Court to appoint an examiner, in an effort to rescue the cash-strapped business. The company has liabilities of €1.5 million and was not in a position to meet its debts.
On Tuesday 4 November 2008, the company's goods were auctioned in an effort to raise money to solve debts.
The company has since gone into liquidation.

<doc id="21398022" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21398022" title="Cotonti">
Cotonti

Cotonti is a modular open source content management system and content management framework powered by PHP and MySQL.
For an end-user Cotonti is a medium-featured content management system suitable for online communities, business and personal sites in first place, that can be extended for a variety of other site kinds: blogs, E-commerce, newspapers, gaming clans, corporate portals, etc.
From a developer's point of view it consists of a minimalistic content management framework and a set of modules implementing standard behavior for exact website types. Application logic is built in conventional scripting style relying on APIs and models provided by the framework and other modules.
A typical website setup is managed completely from a user front-end and administration backend and requires no coding skills. Custom websites may require PHP, SQL or HTML/CSS coding skills depending on type of a task: content markup, layout markup, application coding and localization procedures are completely differentiated from each other which is suitable for small to medium teams.
Through the years of its evolution Cotonti has become similar to Drupal in many of its design aspects such as procedural core, bootstrapping, modular architecture and basic features found in many other systems too. But its unique tendencies are towards a harvested framework and unbound customizability in both layout and behavior.
Features.
The engine distinguishes itself from other content management systems by keeping the HTML code completely separate from the PHP. This allows graphic designers to create themes (in versions prior to 0.9 skins) without having to know much PHP. Cotonti can be skinned by editing pre-made skins supplied by the community, or easily making one's own by creating a template, and simply substituting for the TPL tags.
The engine sports the customary features of a CMS: Message boards, Administration tools, news system, polls, user file uploading, page creation, user registration; additional features can be added to the default engine via plugins.
As a CMS, it can be extremely user-driven, requiring minimal input from moderators.
Cotonti, while in some ways more basic than other content management systems, allows the possibility to be expanded and customized in every way. It is designed to be bare-bones and basic to prevent bloating of the core and leave additional features to be added at the choice of the individual website administrators. This has always been the central philosophy behind the design of the engine.
Cotonti has support for Seditio plugins as well as a growing library of its own plugins.
The design and layout of each site is supported by Web templates which allows the administrator to design a single or multiple templates to be used and chosen preference over by the users visiting the site.
Support for multilingual sites allows for templates and plugins to be customized to support a wide variety of users on a single site. In turn, this allows each site member to choose a suitable language through which to view the site.
Major Features.
For users who have experience with other systems it might be important to highlight its most important features:
Architecture.
Cotonti can be easily extended by several kinds of add-ons supported by the system. Some of them are provided in the default package, the rest can be obtained from third-party sources, including both non-commercial and commercial work.
You can imagine a building to understand the Cotonti architecture. The entire building stands on a basement which is known as Core Libraries or APIs. The basement also provides an infrastructure that can be utilized by the rest of the building. Then there are blocks standing on the basement and containing actual rooms - these are called Modules. Each module represent a special kind of space (e.g. a kitchen, a living room, a bathroom) which can be inhabited by site users. These rooms may be extended by many kinds of facilities, including furniture, domestic appliances, electronic systems - these are Plugins. And finally, you can paint the exterior, choose decorations and customize any detail in the appearance of your house - these are Themes.
Modules and Plugins are very similar technically, so they are often called together Extensions.
Standard behavior of Cotonti's building blocks can be modified in many of specific entry points called Hooks. Plugins may have specific parts which "hook" into those entry points to modify the control flow or provide more output variables and output sections.
Security.
Cotonti provides protection from many known web site attack methods: PHP includes, malformed file uploads, SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and others.
Development.
Cotonti core and basic package is developed by a team of part-time volunteers and small businesses from different parts of the world. Contributions are contained in a public source repository. Technical aspects of implementation are usually decided within the team.
New features and enhancements are proposed by the community, discussed on the public forum. Electronic voting is used when necessary.
Actual bug tracking, project management and source monitoring happens on GitHub.
History.
The history of Cotonti started in 2001 when a professional programmer Olivier Chapuis from Grenoble, France released a new PHP/MySQL Content Management System called Land Down Under (LDU). It was a modern and rock-solid site management system, especially popular among gaming portals and online communities.
In 2006 Neocrome, the company behind LDU, replaced it by a new system called Seditio, a proprietary PHP/MySQL content management system by Olivier and a small team of developers. Seditio had better support for plugins and higher extensibility than LDU. It was very lightweight and secure compared to other PHP content management systems on the market of those days. Seditio and Land Down Under projects were officially closed in 2011 but soon reopened again. Cotonti is the only actual derivative of the LDU/Seditio product line and both projects are currently developed in parallel.
Cotonti emerged as an attempt of skilled enthusiasts from Seditio community to improve the system while the official team was inactive or rejected patches to the proprietary codebase. It was started as a set of improvements to Seditio in 2008 and was first publicly released as a self-contained project on February 1, 2009, after the official permission from Neocrome to release Cotonti and its inherited Seditio code as open source code had been received.
The initial Cotonti branch was called Genesis, it consisted of releases 0.0.1-0.0.5 and included all the changes which were expected from Seditio for a long time. Then the second branch called Genoa was released, which continued the improvements requested by the community. By 2010 Cotonti 0.6.x Genoa gained extremely high stability and regular updates to this stable branch only include very minor bug fixes. There are a lot of free extensions available for 0.6.x and the system is considered very mature.
While having a rock-solid stable branch available, the Cotonti Team started working on a new branch named Siena in 2009. It has a more modern architecture with high modularity and a Content Management Framework (CMF) inside, includes several major changes which are not possible in the Genoa branch. The first official release in this branch was 0.9.0, made on April 4, 2011. Currently the Cotonti Team and Community make efforts to make 0.9.x branch as reliable as 0.6.x, provided with lots of useful extensions and widespread.
License.
Cotonti is distributed under terms of BSD License. And it has exclusive permission to use code from Seditio/Neocrome and distribute it under the same terms. As a result, Cotonti is free of charge for both non-commercial and commercial use with respect of the original copyrights.

Charles Henry Brownlow

Field Marshal Sir Charles Henry Brownlow, (12 December 1831 – 5 April 1916) was a senior Indian Army officer. He served on the North West Frontier in the Hazara Campaign of 1853 and the campaign against the Mohmands in 1854. At the start of the Indian Mutiny, Brownlow was asked to raise an infantry regiment and formed the 8th Punjab Infantry which he commanded during that campaign, the Second Opium War, the Ambela Campaign and the Hazara Campaign of 1868. He commanded a column for the Lushai Expedition and then served as Assistant Military Secretary for India for ten years. After his retirement, as senior retired officer of the Indian Army, he was promoted to field marshal.
Military career.
Born the son of George Arthur Brownlow and Cornelia Paulina Henrietta Brownlow (née Sandby), Brownlow was commissioned into the Bengal Army on 20 December 1847. He became Adjutant of the 1st Sikh Infantry, a unit formed to defend the North West Frontier, in 1851 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 10 September 1852, he fought in the Hazara Campaign of 1853 and was mentioned in despatches. He also fought in the campaign against the Mohmands in 1854 when he was wounded and again mentioned in despatches.
In 1857, in response to the Indian Mutiny, Brownlow was asked to raise an infantry regiment and formed the 8th Punjab Infantry. During the fighting he remained on the front line in command of his regiment. After taking part in the Yusafzai expedition, like other officers at the time, he obtained a commission in the British Indian Army in August 1858. Promoted to captain on 3 November 1858, he was present at the Battle of the Taku Forts in August 1860 and the subsequent occupation of Peking during the Second Opium War. He joined the Bengal Staff Corps in January 1861 and, following promotion to bevet major on 15 February 1861, he led his regiment at the Battle of Crag Piquet in November 1863 during the Ambela Campaign. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 August 1864.
Promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 5 August 1864 and substantive major on 20 December 1867, Brownlow commanded his regiment during the Hazara Campaign in 1868. Promoted to colonel on 11 August 1869 and appointed aide-de-camp to the Queen on 30 October 1869, he commanded the Right (or Chittagong) Column for the Lushai Expedition in 1871. After being given command of a brigade at Rawalpindi, he was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 10 September 1872. He returned to England in 1877 and became Assistant Military Secretary for India in 1879. He was promoted to major-general on 1 July 1881, promoted to lieutenant-general on 7 September 1884 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath 5 January 1888. He was promoted again to full general on 22 January 1889 before retiring in 1890.
Brownlow became colonel of the 20th Duke of Cambridge's Own Infantry (Brownlow's Punjabis) in May 1904 and, as senior retired officer of the Indian Army, he was promoted to field marshal on 20 June 1908. He lived at Warfield Hall at Warfield in Berkshire; he died there on 5 April 1916 and was buried at St Michael the Archangel Churchyard in Warfield.
Family.
In 1890 he married Georgiana King; they had no children.

Cloud testing

Cloud testing is a form of software testing in which web applications use cloud computing environments (a "cloud") to simulate real-world user traffic.
Overview.
Cloud Testing uses cloud infrastructure for software testing. 
Organizations pursuing testing in general and load, performance testing and production service monitoring in particular are challenged by several problems like limited test budget, meeting deadlines, high costs per test, large number of test cases, and little or no reuse of tests and geographical distribution of users add to the challenges. Moreover ensuring high quality service delivery and avoiding outages requires testing in one's datacenter, outside the data-center, or both. Cloud Testing is the solution to all these problems. Effective unlimited storage, quick availability of the infrastructure with scalability, flexibility and availability of distributed testing environment reduce the execution time of testing of large applications and lead to cost-effective solutions.
Need for cloud testing.
Traditional approaches to test a software incurs high cost to simulate user activity from different geographic locations. Testing firewalls and load balancers involves expenditure on hardware, software and its maintenance.
In case of applications where rate of increase in number of users is unpredictable or there is variation in deployment environment depending on client requirements, cloud testing is more effective.
Types of testing.
Stress test.
Stress Test is used to determine ability of application to maintain a certain level of effectiveness beyond breaking point. It is essential for any application to work even under excessive stress and maintain stability. Stress testing assures this by creating peak loads using simulators. But the cost of creating such scenarios is enormous. Instead of investing capital in building on-premise testing environments, cloud testing offers an affordable and scalable alternative.
Load test.
Load testing of an application involves creation of heavy user traffic, and measuring its response. There is also a need to tune the performance of any application to meet certain standards.
Performance test.
Finding out thresholds, bottlenecks & limitations is a part of performance testing. For this, testing performance under a particular workload is necessary. By using cloud testing, it is easy to create such environment and vary the nature of traffic on-demand. This effectively reduces cost and time by simulating thousands of geographically targeted users.
Functional testing.
Functional testing of both internet and non-internet applications can be performed using cloud testing. The process of verification against specifications or system requirements is carried out in the cloud instead of on-site software testing.
Compatibility testing.
Using cloud environment, instances of different Operating Systems can be created on demand, making compatibility testing effortless.
Browser performance testing.
To verify application's support for various browser types and performance in each type can be accomplished with ease. Various tools enable automated website testing from the cloud.
Latency testing.
Cloud testing is utilized to measure the latency between the action and the corresponding response for any application after deploying it on cloud.
Steps.
Companies simulate real world Web users by using cloud testing services that are provided by cloud service vendors such as Advaltis, Compuware, HP, Keynote Systems, Load Impact, Neotys and SOASTA. Once user scenarios are developed and the test is designed, these service providers leverage cloud servers (provided by cloud platform vendors such as Amazon.com, Google, Rackspace, Microsoft, etc.) to generate web traffic that originates from around the world. Once the test is complete, the cloud service providers deliver results and analytics back to corporate IT professionals through real-time dashboards for a complete analysis of how their applications and the internet will perform during peak volumes.
Applications.
Cloud testing is often seen as only performance or load tests, however, as discussed earlier it covers many other types of testing. Cloud computing itself is often referred to as the marriage of software as a service (SaaS) and utility computing. In regard to test execution, the software offered as a service may be a transaction generator and the cloud provider's infrastructure software, or may just be the latter. Distributed Systems and Parallel Systems mainly use this approach for testing, because of their inherent complex nature. D-Cloud is an example of such a software testing environment.
<br>
For testing non-internet applications, virtual instances of testing environment can be quickly set up to do automated testing of the application.
The cloud testing service providers provide essential testing environment as per the requirement of the application under test. The actual testing of applications is performed by the testing team of the organization which owns the application or third party testing vendors.
Tools.
Leading cloud computing service providers include, among others, Amazon, Advaltis, 3-terra, Skytap, HP and SOASTA. Some of the tools for cloud testing include :
Benefits.
The ability and cost to simulate web traffic for software testing purposes has been an inhibitor to overall web reliability. The low cost and accessibility of the cloud's extremely large computing resources provides the ability to replicate real world usage of these systems by geographically distributed users, executing wide varieties of user scenarios, at scales previously unattainable in traditional testing environments. Minimal start-up time along with quality assurance can be achieved by cloud testing.
Following are some of the key benefits:
Issues.
The initial setup cost for migrating testing to cloud is very high as it involves modifying some of the test cases to suit cloud environment. This makes the decision of migration crucial. Therefore, cloud testing is not necessarily the best solution to all testing problems. 
<br>Legacy systems & services need to be modified in order to be tested on cloud. Usage of robust interfaces with these legacy systems may solve this problem. Also like any other cloud services, cloud testing is vulnerable to security issues.
<br>The test results may not be accurate due to varying performance of service providers’ network and internet. In many cases, service virtualization can be applied to simulate the specific performance and behaviors required for accurate and thorough testing.
Current scenario.
An evolving cloud testing community is forming under the auspices of the Software Testing & Quality Assurance group hosted by LinkedIn. Testing professionals openly share their experiences and exchange ideas related to cloud testing in order to enhance each other's proficiencies.

Maryland Digital Cultural Heritage

Maryland Digital Cultural Heritage (MDCH) is a collaborative, statewide digitization program. Headquartered at the Enoch Pratt Free Library/State Library Resource Center in Baltimore, the program partners with Maryland libraries, archives, historical societies, museums, and other institutions to digitize and provide free online access to materials relating to the state's history and culture. Materials in MDCH's online digital collections include maps, manuscripts, photographs, artwork, books, and other media.
History.
The program began in 2002 with a Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant administered by the Maryland State Department of Education's Division of Library Development and Services (DLDS). The grant funded an initial survey of institutions, the goal of which was to learn about collections relevant to any aspect of Maryland's state, regional, and local culture and history. The survey gathered information on each collection regarding: content; age; condition; quantity of items; relationships to other collections; copyright issues; existing catalogs and indexes; and items of particular interest and/or value. The LSTA grant also provided the basis for the purchase of digitization equipment and the creation of a union catalog. Early on in the program, MDCH established digitization standards and metadata guidelines for its collections.
Collections and Access.
The MDCH website currently has over 40 collections of items pertaining to a variety of subjects, people, events, and geographic locations in Maryland. New collections are added on a regular basis. Collection overviews provide the location of the original items and a description of the collection. Visitors to the MDCH site are able to view digitized items and data about each item by browsing within a collection, or by performing a search.

Joseph IV (Chaldean Patriarch)

Mar Joseph IV Timotheus Lazar Hindi was the fourth incumbent of the "Josephite" line of Church of the East, a patriarchate in Full Communion with the pope mainly active in the areas of Amid and Mardin, thus being considered the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church from 1757 to 1796.
Life.
Lazar Hindi, born on 14 September 1726, educated by the Urban college in Rome, was elected patriarch after the death, happened on 23 January 1757, of his predecessor Joseph III Timothy Maroge. He was consecrated bishop on 8 February 1757 by Yohannan Basil, bishop of Mardin (died 1758), who in turn was consecrated bishop in 1741 by Joseph III. Lazar Hindi was confirmed patriarch by the Clement XIII on 25 March 1759 and received the pallium on 9 April 1759. He took the name of Joseph ("Youssef") IV.
From 1765 to 1768 he went to Rome for printing Chaldean liturgical books and Gospels.
Lazar Hindi coped with the main problem of his predecessors: the tax burdens imposed by the Ottoman authorities on his churches with any kind of pretexts. As his predecessor, in the 1770s he visited the European courts to raise founds but without results.
Back in Amid, dispirited, he resigned in August 1780, appointing as successor his nephew Augustine Hindi. The Holy See accepted the resignation in 1781 but objected the succession to his nephew. Informed of this, Lazar Hindi withdrew his resignation and remained in Amid.
In 1789 Lazar Hindi was imprisoned by the Turkish authorities for his debt of twenty thousand "piastras". He escaped in 1790 and left for Rome.
When he arrived in Rome in March 1791, he found that the Vatican was not so interested in his little patriarchate, while was working on possible unions with both the patriarchate of Qochanis, whose patriarch Mar Shimun XV Maqdassi Mikhail in 1770 wrote to Rome to establish contacts, and mainly with the ancient patriarchate of Alqosh, contended by two cousins, one of which, Yohannan VIII Eliya Hormizd, considered himself a Catholic. In 1791 the Vatican had given the government of Amid, the main town of Lazar Hindi's patriarchate, to Yohannan Hormizd. Lazar Hindi vehemently excepted, and in 1793 succeeded to have his nephew Augustine returned to be the episcopal administrator of Amid, besides being patriarchal administrator.
Lazar Hindi died in Italy in 1796.

St. Quentin (Pontormo)

St. Quentin is a painting attributed to the Italian Renaissance master Jacopo Pontormo. According to Giorgio Vasari's "Vite", one of Pontormo's pupils, Gianmaria Pichi, was commissioned by his hometown of Sansepolcro a processional standard with the figure of St. Quentin; Pontormo decided to collaborate on the work, at the extent that he finished to complete most of it. The saint's posture resembles that of the "Dying Slave" by Michelangelo: the fact that Pontormo was friend of the latter, confirms the attribution.
The position of the nails in St. Quentin's body is directly inspired to Jacopo da Varagine's "Legenda Aurea".

Students Rowing Flanders

Students Rowing in Flanders is still in its infancy. Only in 2004 the first students rowing club started up in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is envisaged that it will become an association in the near future. Below is a list of any student club or institution of higher education that operates as a students rowing club in Flanders.
Limburg County.
Xios Rowing Team of XIOS University College Limburg, the Rowing Club of the University of Hasselt, the team of Catholic University College Limburg and the Provincial University College Limburg are active since 2004 on the Albert Canal connecting
Liège (city), and Antwerp near Hasselt in the Belgian province of Limburg. 
In 2005, they bought their own boats and the rowers have their own home in the Royal Yachting Club of Hasselt. 
Each year the Student Regatta Hasselt (HSR) has massive and still growing public interest. 
The University of Hasselt also works closely together across borders with the University of Maastricht.
East Flanders County.
Ghent Students Rowing.
In East Flanders the association Ghent Students Rowing, builds a network with the University .
In Ghent, the non-profit organization got any subsidy and therefore it works together with host clubs. Although they introduce many Erasmus Students to rowing and they cooperate well will the Dutch Federation even any support from the European Union or the Benelux is helping them until today.
They were established in 2004 at the Royal Club Nautique de Gand with the mayor support of Akhenaton Rowing School Foundation from Brussels and there are still regular extra - sporting activities of S.R.G. at Club de Gand. The second and main host club and sponsor today is the Veterans Rowers Association.
Royal Club Nautique de Gand.
This club offers students rowing since the 1960s. 
They promote the sport at four local colleges, including the School of Arts and Architecture, the Catholic University College Saint-Lieven, the Ghent University College, the Artevelde University College, the University of Ghent, Ghent Students Rowing and Leuven, the MBA institute and all the Alumni associations. They row on the local urban rowing race court Watersportbaan and also in the many adjoining rivers and canals such as the Coupure, Portus Ganda and Graslei, which has urban features.
Neighboring Countries.
What Western Europe is concerned, especially Netherlands and England have a long tradition of studentsrowing. 
An upcoming country is Spain. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Students Rowing Federation (Member of the Royal Dutch Rowing Federation) NSRF is supplier of 80% of the international top athletes. But with the northern neighbors of Flanders, there is also much attention to the so-called 'non fanatical' - fun - competition of the National Discussion Organ Competition Rowing (NOOC) with its annual Opening Contest by TSR Vidar on the Rowing race Court Watersportbaan in Tilburg end of March. End of June is the Orca Students Competition Final Races and Company Eights Regatta on the Bosbaan. Another important association is close to Belgium MSRV Saurus from Maastricht. There is also the classic Varsity. 
In England you have massively many students regatta. Temple Challenge Cup is the absolute top for student associations in England and on the European continent. There is every year prime time news and international prestige with the famous Boat Race.

Pierce was critically injured when a bomb exploded in his hybrid Lexus SUV on the morning of Wednesday, 4 February 2009. The 54-year-old Pierce was badly injured, with burns on 18 percent of his body, two broken bones, the loss of his left eye and damage to the right.
Pierce was well known in his West Memphis community, but police at first had no leads in the bombing. However, Pierce was a co-defendant in a wrongful death suit against the Arkansas Supreme Court up until a few weeks prior to the bombing.
On August 7, Pierce made his first appearance at the Arkansas Medical Board since the bombing. On August 10, police announced that Dr. Randeep Mann, who had been arrested in March on unrelated weapons charges, was the "prime suspect" in the bombing. He had previously been disciplined by the Arkansas Medical Board for overprescribing pain medication . 
On January 6, 2010, a superseding indictment, with ten total charges, was issued against Mann and his wife. Mann was charged alone in six counts; one pertained to use of a weapon of mass destruction, one to malicious use of an explosive on a vehicle, three to unregistered grenades and firearms, one to unlawful possession of a machine gun, and one to possession of contraband, specifically chloroform, while in federal custody. He and his wife were charged jointly with two counts of obstruction or impedance of justice, and Sue Mann was charged with making a false declaration to a federal grand jury.
Mann was convicted on August 9, 2010, of conspiracy to carry out the bombing. His wife Sangeeta Mann was convicted of conspiring to conceal the evidence. To date there is no forensic evidence tying Randeep Mann or Sangeeta "Sue" Mann to the bombing. His conviction was based on circumstancial evidence, which carries the same legal weight as "real evidence", however is not based on the concrete.

Wards Airfield

Wards Airfield is a former World War II airfield near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The airfield was abandoned after the war and was developed into the Waigani area of Port Moresby.
The airfield was named in honor of Australian Lt. Col. K. H. Ward, who was involved with its construction and was KIA on 27 August 1942, during the fighting at Isurava on the Kokoda Trail. It was also known as "5-Mile or 5-Mile Drome" by Americans, for its distance from Port Moresby.
History.
Wards Airfield was built for heavy bombers and transport planes. By 1943, it was the busiest aerodrome in the southern hemisphere. Mainly used for Cargo aircraft and larger planes, Ward's was nearest to Jackson Airfield (7 Mile Drome), and at its height, its taxiways actually connected with those of 7-mile.
The major operational organization at Wards Airfield was the Headquarters, 54th Troop Carrier Wing (3 May 1943 – 18 April 1944). Operational C-47 Skytrain groups and squadrons assigned to the airfield were:
Several Reconnaissance groups were assigned to Wards to support Fifth Air Force operations:
In addition the 90th Bombardment Group also based two B-24 Liberator squadrons at the airfield.
Royal Australian Air Force units stationed at the airfield were the 9th Group, 22nd Squadron (A-20) and 30th Squadron (Beaufighter).
General Kenney's Headquarters, V Fighter Command was located at the airfield between December–January 1942. Reportedly, its cement slab foundations still remain today, located on a hill behind the airfield. A large 5th Air Force insignia and USAAF star, drawn into the concrete. Concrete steps, a garden and path that went up the ridge towards the HQ. In the 1980s traces of the paint still remained. Today, both the 5th AF logo and USSAF are partially broken, and the area is overgrown, but it still offers commanding views and an impressive remnant of the American era at the airfield.
This marking overlooks the Chinese Embassy. To visit the slab, drive down Sir John Guise Drive, cross the intersection with Independence Way and Godwit Street and keep going in the direction of the golf club. When that road begins to make a left turn, there is a hill on your right.
Wards Airfield was also the home of the USAAF 27th Air Depot. This group was responsible for assembling crated aircraft delivered by ship docked in Fairfax Harbor from the United States. Brand new aircraft were delivered to Port Moresby assembled and then flown to other bases. Ships continued to dock at Port Moresby until mid-1945 when transports switched to Manila Bay. For pilots wishing to pick up a brand new plane, they would have to go all the way back to Port Moresby
Current status.
One can still drive along the main runway. In the post war years, most of its aircraft revetments were bulldozed flat, and a scrap dealer operated there, melting down aluminum from aircraft remains. Locals would siphon gasoline from the aircraft fuel tanks for their own use well into the 1950s.

<doc id="21398258" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21398258" title="Scyllarus arctus">
Scyllarus arctus

Scyllarus arctus is a species of slipper lobster which lives in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is uncommon in British and Irish waters, but a number of English-language vernacular names have been applied, including "small European locust lobster", "lesser slipper lobster" and "broad lobster".
Distribution.
"S. arctus" is found throughout the Mediterranean Sea, and in eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean, from the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands as far north as the English Channel. The species is rare north of the Bay of Biscay; several specimens have been seen in British waters, but nonetheless, "S. arctus" is rarer in Britain than the giant squid, "Architeuthis dux". Until 1960, "S. arctus" was thought to be the only species of "Scyllarus" in the Mediterranean Sea, but then it was realised that the lesser known "Scyllarus pygmaeus" is also present throughout much of the Mediterranean Sea.
Description.
"Scyllarus arctus" may reach up to long, although sizes of are more typical. It is reddish-brown in colour, with a dark brown spot in the centre of each abdominal somite, although this is not sharply defined. The pereiopods have a dark blue ring around each segment. It can be told apart from its close relative "Scyllarus pygmaeus", which lives sympatrically with "S. arctus", chiefly by its larger size, but also by other features such as the shape of a tubercle on the last thoracic sternite; this is flattened in "S. arctus", but conical in "S. pygmaeus". "S. arctus" has among the smallest measured genome sizes in the Order Decapoda, at less than a third of that seen in the related genus "Scyllarides".
Ecology.
"S. arctus" is susceptible to white spot syndrome, and is predated upon by a wide range of demersal fish. It lives at depths of 4–50 m on muddy or rocky substrates, and in "Posidonia" meadows. It is the subject of small scale fishery, but its scarcity and its small size make it an unattractive target.

Aurantia, Florida

Aurantia was an unincorporated community in the north end of Brevard County, Florida, United States at the intersection of Aurantia Road and the Florida East Coast Railway, where it was a station along the "Enterprise Branch" line.
Geography.
Aurantia was located at . It was bounded by the north by Scottsmoor; on the east by U.S. 1; on the south by Turnbull, Florida and on the west by the Volusia County line.
Demise.
The closing of the East Aurantia railroad station and abandonment of the track was the beginning of the end for the hamlet. The construction of Interstate 95 created a railroad overpass and split the community in half, forcing the relocation of many residents away from the crossroads and ending its identity. The area now is serviced by the post office at Mims, Florida.
Rail Trail.
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection took ownership of the rail bed on December 31, 2007, and a salvage company completed removal of the track in 2008. The 51 mile corridor is projected to become Florida's longest rails-to-trails project and will be named, "East Central Regional Rail-Trail" (ECRRT). The purchase from Florida East Coast Railway was acquired using Florida Forever program money.

RK-55

The Novator RK-55 "Granat" ( 'Garnet'; NATO:SSC-X-4 'Slingshot'; GRAU:3K10) was a Soviet land-based cruise missile with a nuclear warhead. It was about to enter service in 1987 when such weapons were banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. A version launched from submarine torpedo tubes, the S-10 "Granat" (SS-N-21 'Sampson';GRAU:3M10), has apparently been converted to carry conventional warheads and continues in service to this day.
The RK-55 is very similar to the air-launched Kh-55 (AS-15 'Kent') but the Kh-55 has a drop-down turbofan engine and was designed by MKB Raduga. Both have formed the basis of post-Cold-War missiles, in particular the 3M-54 Klub (SS-N-27 'Sizzler') which has a supersonic approach phase.
Development.
In the late 1960s, the "Ekho" study conducted by the GosNIIAS institute concluded that it would be more effective to deploy lots of small, subsonic cruise missiles than the much more expensive supersonic missiles then in favour. In 1971 Raduga began working on the air-launched Kh-55, which first flew in 1976. That same year, Later NPO Novator would work on the submarine- and ground-launched versions. In 1993 Novator exhibited the 3M14/3M54 Klub (SS-N-27 'Sizzler'), which appears to be based on the RK-55. It is a two-stage design, which goes supersonic during its final approach to the target.
Design.
Six RK-55 missiles are carried on an eight-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) based on the MAZ 543 launcher of the R-17 (SS-1 'Scud B').
The S-10 is launched through 533 mm torpedo tubes.
Operational history.
Fewer than 100 SS-N-21s had been deployed by the end of 1988. The new , launched in September 1986, was the first class to receive the new missile. It was later fitted to the Sierra I/II class and eight Victor III's and the new s.
The "Grusha-class" submarine deployed in 1988 is a design of particular note, replacing the missile launchers on a ballistic submarine with tubes dedicated to large numbers of cruise missiles. They were probably nuclear-tipped RK-55's during the Cold War, and then converted to use conventional warheads for land attack after the START I treaty restricted sub-launched nuclear cruise missiles. The US Navy has done the same on a grander scale with the SSGN conversions of four s. It has been suggested that RK-55's could in future be fitted to converted Delta class submarines, or to surface ships, but these have not been confirmed.
The ground-launched variant was subject to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed in December 1987 and had been tested but not deployed by that time. 80 missiles had been destroyed by November 1990.
Variants.
Conventional unitary High Explosive (HE) warhead and submunition warhead versions of the RK-55 have probably been developed, to justify the continuing service of the submarines that carry them.

Mark S. Pafford

Mark S. Pafford (born April 11, 1966) is a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 86th District, which includes Haverhill, Loxahatchee Groves, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington in east-central Palm Beach County, since 2012, previously representing the 88th District from 2008 to 2012.
History.
Pafford was born in unincorporated Miami-Dade County in 1966 and attended North Miami High School, graduating in 1984. After high school, he was a student at Miami-Dade Community College, receiving his associate degree in 1986, and then at Florida International University, where he received a degree in public administration in 1988. Following graduation, he worked as a naturalist at Arch Creek Park in North Miami. Pafford then worked for United States Congressman Lawrence J. Smith as a congressional aide from 1989 to 1992, and later worked for State Representative Lois Frankel as a legislative assistant from 1996 to 1997. 
Florida House of Representatives.
In 2002, when Frankel, his former boss, was unable to seek re-election in the Florida House of Representatives due to term limits, Pafford ran to succeed her in the 85th District, which stretched from Wellington to Lake Worth. He faced Shelley Vana, a teachers union president, in the Democratic primary, and narrowly lost to her, receiving 46% of the vote to her 54%.
Pafford experienced more success in 2008, when State Representative Susan Bucher was unable to seek re-election due to term limits in the 86th District, which stretched from Boynton Beach to Boca Raton in eastern Palm Beach County. He won the Democratic primary and the general election unopposed, winning his first term without any opponents. In 2010, he faced a challenge from Ron Miranda in the Democratic primary, who claimed that Pafford had an insufficiently pro-business voting record and criticized Pafford for his poor standing with Associated Industries of Florida. Pafford responded by calling attention to his voting record and observing that some of the votes that were considered to be votes against the business community were not, noting, "If you look at what I voted against, you'll find things like Senate Bill 6 on education, you'll find some of the Medicaid reform. It's a lot of the bils that group into that pro-business type of votes by the chamber that weren't necessarily business votes." He ended up defeating Miranda to win renomination, scoring 58% of the vote to Miranda's 42%, and advancing to the general election, where he faced only a write-in challenge and won re-election with 95% of the vote.
When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Pafford ran for re-election in the 86th District, which contained some of the territory that he had previously represented. He faced Tami Donnally, the Republican nominee and a business administrator, in the general election. Pafford earned the endorsement of "The Palm Beach Post", which criticized Donnally and praised Pafford for his support for Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and for his opposition to the law that required the closing of "the state's only tuberculosis sanatorium." Pafford ended up defeating Donnally with ease, receiving 60% of the vote to her 40% and winning his third term.
Though State Representative Darryl Rouson was initially elected to serve as House Democrats' floor leader for the 2014-2016 legislative term, he was ousted by the caucus. Pafford, in turn, ran for the position himself and defeated fellow State Representative Alan Williams to win the leadership position, by a vote of 29-12 vote. Assuming that he wins re-election in 2014, he will serve as the Minority Leader for the 2014-2016 legislative term.

The bout took place on July 30, 2011 in Denver.
Alvarado vs. Prescott.
Alvarado fought Breidis Prescott on November 12, 2011, in Las Vegas, USA, on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel Marquez III. Prescott started out the fight fast, and was able to out-box Alvarado for the first 5 rounds successfully, building a lead on the scorecards. In the middle and late rounds, Alvarado became the main aggressor, and cut the distance, effectively trading shots with Prescott on the inside, and winning the middle and late rounds. By the 10th round, Prescott seemed out of gas, and Alvarado took advantage launching a large offensive attack in the opening minute of the round. Then, with 1:43 left in the fight, Alvarado knocked Prescott down with left and right uppercuts. Prescott was able to get up, but Alvarado came back with two hard rights sending Prescott to the ropes, and then landed 3 straight right uppercuts. Prescott was leaning forward, hanging onto Alvarado and not returning fire, prompting the referee to stop the fight with 1:07 left in the bout. Alvarado was down 87-84, 87-84, and 86-85 at the time of stoppage, in what was a close fight.
Alvarado vs. Herrera.
Alvarado's next fight was against a Top Light Welterweight contender in Mauricio Herrera, at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Herrera was coming off solid wins over Mike Dallas Jr. and Ruslan Provodnikov prior to his bout with Alvarado. Herrera started off the fight well, successfully beating Alvarado to the punch, and slipping most of Alvarado's attack in the first round. In the 2nd round, Herrera decided to stand and trade with the bigger Alvarado, in a round where Alvarado controlled the pace and landed the harder punches. The pace would continue in the early and middle rounds, with Alvarado taking Herrera to the ropes and landing the harder punches, but with Herrera landing combinations of his own in Alvarado. By the later rounds, Alvarado had seized control, and began to tee off on Herrera, who's eye was completely close by rounds 9 and 10. The fighters ended the fight in the 12th round, trading blows in the middle of the ring. Alvarado was awarded the clear Unanimous Decision win, with scores of 99-91, 97-93, and 96-94. After the fight, Alvarado said he wanted a big fight with Mexican Champion Juan Manuel Marquez, saying he's paid his dues and deserves a big fight at this point.
He was named to "The Gatti List" on "The Fight Game with Jim Lampley" on HBO in May 2012. The list consists of the Top 10 most entertaining fighters.
Alvarado vs. Rios I & II.

Rios was able to stop him in the 7th as referee Pat Russell stopped the bout at 1:57 of the round. The fight was voted the 2012 Fight of the Year by the "Sports Illustrated".
A much anticipated rematch was held on March 30, 2013 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada. Like the first fight, both came in with a lot of fireworks as they continued to go toe to toe, until Alvarado changed strategy and became a lot more evasive and hard to hit with fancy footwork. Alvarado defeated Rios by via unanimous decision with scores of 115-113, 115-113 and 114-113 to even up the victory score with Rios, each at this point giving each other their first losses. Top Rank promoter Bob Arum dismissed another rematch and suggested to let the two boxers face other fighters first.
Alvarado vs. Provodnikov.
Mike Alvarado lost his WBO light welterweight title to Ruslan Provodnikov on October 19, 2013 at the FirstBank Center in Alvarado's hometown of Denver, Colorado. Provodnikov was ahead on all three scorecards and had knocked Alvarado down twice in the eighth round, when Alvarado elected to not come out for the eleventh round. 
Alvarado vs. Marquez.

I've Never Seen Star Wars (radio series)

"I've Never Seen Star Wars" is a comedy talk show broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Hosted by comedian Marcus Brigstocke, each episode features a celebrity guest trying out experiences that are new to them, but common to many others. The title comes from the show's producer and creator, Bill Dare, having never seen the "Star Wars" films. The series has been the subject of controversy due to the questionable taste of some of the experiences.
The show has been adapted for television and was first broadcast on BBC Four in early 2009.
Format.
Each episode features a guest presenting a list of things to Brigstocke that, until coming on the show, they had never done before but many others have. Generally the show is structured around one each of certain types of experiences; reading a new book, listening to some new music, watching a new film or television programme (for all of these, the guest is often given an example of a genre they've never sampled before), eating a new food and taking part in a new leisure activity. Examples of the latter include comedian Phill Jupitus having his first colonic irrigation, magician Paul Daniels learning how to swim and Goodies star Tim Brooke-Taylor buying his first pornographic magazine.
Reception.
The series has a mixed reception. Critics have praised the format. Chris Campling said "I've Never Seen Star Wars" is, "one of the most invigorating new comedy series of the 21st century."
Elisabeth Mahoney in "The Guardian" wrote about Jupitus' appearance saying: "He also tried colonic irrigation, and the recording of that was one of the funniest bits of radio this year. The therapist explained the process in a deadpan manner that was quite majestic, especially when she let her "tubing clamps" make their worrying sound effect. Jupitus fretted that she'd find "some hidden G-spot of delight" and that he'd become "sexually addicted to having my arse pumped out". Rather worryingly, then, he has already booked his next appointment."
However, the series has been attacked because of some of the experiences which have appeared. Jupitus' colonic irrigation and eating foie gras, and Brooke-Taylor buying pornography are amongst the moments which have been cause for complaint. Dare appeared on BBC Radio 4's listener complaints show "Feedback" to defend "I've Never Seen Star Wars". Dare stated the choices were all made by the guests and were not designed to offend listeners. During the interview with host Roger Bolton, Dare was asked, "if he could reassure listeners that there'd be no heavy breathing in future." Dare mocked both "Feedback" and Bolton saying: "Only if we get an asthmatic on, I suppose. But now asthmatics are going to ring up and say, how dare you make fun of our condition?"
Episodes.
Five series of "I've Never Seen Star Wars" have been broadcast.

Andrée Peel

Andrée Peel (February 3, 1905 – March 5, 2010) was one of a couple of women known as "Agent Rose" (the other being Eileen Nearne). 
She worked against the German occupation of France as a member of the French Resistance during the Second World War.
Early life.
Born as Andrée Marthe Virot, when World War II broke out she was running a beauty salon in the Breton port of Brest, France.
World War II.
After the German invasion she joined the resistance and was involved in distributing secret newspapers but was later appointed head of an under-section of the resistance. She and her team used torches to guide allied planes to improvised landing strips and helped airmen who had landed in France to escape onto submarines and gunboats, saving the lives of more than one hundred soldiers and airmen, and aided more than 20,000 people.
She was arrested in Paris in 1944 and sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp; she was later transferred to the concentration camp at Buchenwald before her eventual release. During this time she also survived meningitis. She was being lined up to be shot by firing squad at Buchenwald when the US Army arrived to liberate the prisoners.
After the war.
After the war, she met her future husband, an English academic named John Peel (who at the time was still a student), while working in a restaurant in Paris, and they settled in Long Ashton, near Bristol, several years later. The union was happy and the couple had no children. While living in Long Ashton, Andrée received many visits from admirers and also managed to relieve the pain of visitors who had injuries.
Awards.
Mrs. Peel received many decorations from the French government for her resistance work, and she was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the United States and the King’s Commendation for Brave Conduct by Britain. During the war she received a personal letter of appreciation from Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
She was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President Eisenhower.
She received the Légion d'honneur from her brother, four-star General Maurice Virot, in 2004. On February 3, 2005, she received a note from the Queen as she had just turned 100 years old. In 2010 she turned 105 and fractured her hip two weeks later after a bad fall and had to undergo surgery. She died peacefully at the Lampton House nursing home on 5 March 2010.
Woodspring MP Liam Fox paid tribute to Mrs Peel, saying: ""Mrs Peel was an iconic figure who showed phenomenal courage in the most difficult circumstances. Her selfless bravery saved many lives and she stands as a monument to the triumph of the human spirit, which will set an example for many generations to come.""
Her house was broken into sometime between the 10th and 11 of March 2010, and several items were stolen, including copies of her autobiography. Police suspect that it was because of the widespread knowledge of her death after reporting in local and national newspapers.
Autobiography.
Her autobiography, "Miracles Do Happen", was published in French as "Miracles Existent!" (English version translated by Evelyn Scott Brown). It has been made into a film by William Ennals.
