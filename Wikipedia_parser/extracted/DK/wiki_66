Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Grouard–McLennan

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Grouard–McLennan () is a particular church of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada. Its ecclesiastic territory includes the northwest section of the Province of Alberta, the boundaries of which are, on the north the 60th parallel north, separating it from the Northwest Territories and the Diocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith. To the south the 55th parallel north, separating it from the Diocese of Saint Paul. On the east the 113th meridian west, separating it from the Diocese of Saint Paul (to the 58th parallel north) and the Diocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith (to the 60th parallel north). To the west the 120th meridian west, separating it from the Province of British Columbia, and the Diocese of Prince George. The archdiocese is the metropolitan see for the Roman Catholic Church in northwestern Canada. The archbishop is the Most Reverend Gérard Pettipas, C.Ss.R.. As archbishop, Pettipas also serves as pastor of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist, the mother church of the archdiocese. Also serving are 7 diocesan priests, 18 religious priests, 2 permanent deacons, 21 religious brothers and 25 religious sisters who are members of various Roman Catholic religious institutes. These priests, deacons and religious serve a Catholic population in northwestern Alberta of 47,899 in 67 parishes and missions.
History.
The Archdiocese of Grouard–McLennan was erected on April 8, 1862 as the Apostolic Vicariate of Athabaska Mackenzie with territory taken from the Diocese of Saint-Boniface. A month later on May 8, 1862, Henri Faraud, O.M.I. was appointed as Apostolic Vicar. Bishop Faraud served until March 20, 1890 when he resigned. He was succeeded by Émile Grouard, O.M.I. who was appointed Apostolic Vicar on October 18, 1890. Bishop Faraud and later Bishop Grouard were assisted by Isidore Clut, O.M.I. who was appointed Auxiliary Bishop on August 3, 1864 and who served until his death on July 9, 1903. 
On July 3, 1901, the territory of the Vicariate was split into the Apostolic Vicariate of Athabaska, which comprised what is today the northwestern area of the Province of Alberta, and the Apostolic Vicariate of Mackenzie, which comprised what today is the Northwest Territories as well as northeastern area of the Province of Alberta. Bishop Grouard remained as the Apostolic Vicar of Athabaska and Gabriel Breynat, O.M.I. was appointed Apostolic Vicar of Mackenzie. A few years after the death of Bishop Clut, Celestine Joussard, O.M.I. was appointed Coadjutor Apostolic Vicar on May 11, 1909. On March 15, 1927, the name of the Vicariate was changed from the Apostolic Vicariate of Athabaska to the Apostolic Vicariate of Grouard. Bishop Joussard never ended up succeeding Bishop Grouard as Apostolic Vicar of Athabaska and both Bishop Grouard and Bishop Joussard retired on April 18, 1929. Following the retirement of Bishop Grouard, Joseph Guy, O.M.I. was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Grouard on December 19, 1929. Bishop Guy served until June 2, 1937 when he was appointed the Bishop of Gravelbourg. 
The following year on March 30, 1938, Ubald Langlois, O.M.I. was appointed Apostolic Vicar of Grouard. On June 15, 1945, Henri Routhier, O.M.I. was appointed Coadjutor Apostolic Vicar. In 1946 Bishop Langlois transferred the seat of the Vicariate from Grouard to McLennan. The Town of Grouard, taking its name from Bishop Grouard when it was incorporated as a town on September 27, 1909, was a thriving community of approximately 1,200 people. This changed when the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway built its new line south of Lesser Slave Lake instead of going through Grouard which was on the north shore of Lesser Slave Lake. The majority of Grouard’s population moved to High Prairie, the newly established town on the railway. Bishop Grouard had originally established a mission at the Lesser Slave Lake settlement, the original name of Grouard, under the patronage of Saint Bernard, in 1872. 
Shortly after the Seat of the Vicariate was transferred to McLennan, work began on a new Cathedral dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. Bishop Langlois served as Apostolic Vicar of Grouard until his death on September 18, 1953. Upon Bishop Langlois death, Bishop Routhier immediately succeeded him as Apostolic Vicar of Grouard. On July 13, 1967, the Apostolic Vicariate of Grouard was elevated to the Archdiocese of Grouard–McLennan and made the Metropolitan See of northwestern Canada with the newly elevated Dioceses of Prince George, Mackenzie-Fort Smith, and Whitehorse as suffragans, (the Diocese of Prince George was later transferred to the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia). On this date all the Apostolic Vicariates in northern Canada were elevated to dioceses. 
Archbishop Routhier served until his resignation on November 21, 1972, he was succeeded by Henri Légaré, O.M.I., who had been Bishop of Labrador-Schefferville. Archbishop Légaré served until his retirement on July 16, 1996. On the same day Henri Goudreault, O.M.I., who had also served as Bishop of Labrador City-Schefferville, was appointed to succeeded him. Archbishop Goudreault died suddenly of a heart attack on July 23, 1998. The Archdiocese of Grouard–McLennan remained vacant until the appointment of Arthé Guimond, who had served as Archdiocesan Administrator, on June 9, 2000. Archbishop Guimond retired on November 30, 2006 and Gérard Pettipas, C.Ss.R. was appointed to succeed him on the same day.
As of 2006, the archdiocese contains 65 parishes and missions, 1 archbishop, 7 active diocesan priests, 16 religious priests, and 46,355 Catholics. It also has 19 Women Religious and 2 permanent deacon.
Bishops.

Pat Perez

Patrick A. Perez (born March 1, 1976) is an American professional golfer. 
Perez was born in Phoenix, Arizona and is of Mexican American descent. He experienced his first PGA Tour victory in 2009 at the Bob Hope Classic. He has finished second twice, including a memorable runner-up result at Pebble Beach when his back-nine collapse led him to attempt to break a club over his leg.
He has featured in the top 100 of the Official World Golf Ranking.
On January 22, 2009, Perez finished the first 36 holes of the Bob Hope Classic with a 124 (-20), the lowest score in PGA Tour history through two rounds, relative to par. The start set or tied several records, including tying the record for low score (124) in consecutive rounds. But on January 24, Steve Stricker broke the latter record of 124 with a 61-62 for 123 combined two rounds (third and fourth rounds). Perez went on to win the tournament by three strokes over John Merrick, a win secured when Perez hit his second shot on the par 5 18th hole from 200 yards to 3 feet to win with a closing eagle for his first tour win.
Perez also experienced a championship of another sort first-hand. As a neighbor of baseball player Pat Burrell, he had been very close to the Philadelphia Phillies for several years. In a January 2010 interview, he revealed, "I was part of that (2008) team (that won the World Series) because I know all of the guys, I had my locker there, I would come and see them all the time. I would really root for them like I was part of the team." When asked if he had the locker during spring training, he replied "No, the whole thing. I would hit balls with Jimmy Rollins, go out on the field and play catch, whatever. I was like one of them team for that year." When Burrell left as a free agent after the 2008 season and signed with the Tampa Bay Rays, Perez called the news "Worse than me getting hurt."

<doc id="5953989" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5953989" title="Supergene (geology)">
Supergene (geology)

In ore deposit geology, supergene processes or enrichment occur relatively near the surface. Supergene processes include the predominance of meteoric water circulation with concomitant oxidation and chemical weathering. The descending meteoric waters oxidize the primary (hypogene) sulfide ore minerals and redistribute the metallic ore elements. Supergene "enrichment" occurs at the base of the oxidized portion of an ore deposit. Metals that have been leached from the oxidized ore are carried downward by percolating groundwater, and react with hypogene sulfides at the supergene-hypogene boundary. The reaction produces secondary sulfides with metal contents higher than those of the primary ore. This is particularly noted in copper ore deposits where the copper sulfide minerals chalcocite Cu2S, covellite CuS, digenite Cu1.8S, and djurleite Cu31S16 are deposited by the descending surface waters.
All such processes take place at essentially atmospheric conditions, 25 °C and atmospheric pressure.
Zones.
Different zones can be identified at different depths. From the surface down they are gossan cap, leached zone, oxidized zone, water table, enriched zone (supergene enriched zone) and primary zone (hypogene zone).
Gossan cap.
Pyrite FeS2 is generally abundant, and near the surface it oxidises to insoluble compounds such as goethite FeO(OH) and limonite, forming a porous covering to the oxidized zone known as gossan or iron hat. Prospectors take gossan as an indication that there might be reserves of ore underneath.
Leached zone.
The groundwater contains dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, and as it travels downwards it leaches out the minerals in the rocks to form sulfuric acid, and other solutions that continue moving downwards.
Oxidized zone.
Above the water table the environment is oxidizing, and below it is reducing.
Solutions travelling downward from the leached zone react with other primary minerals in the oxidised zone to form secondary minerals such as sulfates and carbonates, and limonite, which is a characteristic product in all oxidised zones.
In the formation of secondary carbonates, primary sulfide minerals generally are first converted to sulfates, which in turn react with primary carbonates such as calcite CaCO3, dolomite CaMg(CO3)2 or aragonite (also CaCO3, polymorphic with calcite) to produce secondary carbonates. Soluble salts continue on down, but insoluble salts are left behind in the oxidised zone where they form. An example is the lead mineral anglesite PbSO4. Copper may be precipitated as malachite Cu2(CO3)(OH)2 or azurite Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2. Malachite, azurite, cuprite Cu2O, pyromorphite Pb5(PO4)3Cl and smithsonite ZnCO3 are stable in oxidising conditions and they are characteristic of the oxidation zone.
Water table.
At the water table the environment changes from an oxidizing environment to a reducing one.
Enriched zone.
Copper ions that move down into this reducing environment form a zone of supergene sulfide enrichment. Covellite CuS, chalcocite Cu2S and native copper Cu are stable in these conditions and they are characteristic of the enriched zone. 
The net effect of these supergene processes is to move metal ions from the leached zone to the enriched zone, increasing the concentration there to levels higher than in the unmodified primary zone, possibly producing a deposit worth mining.
Primary zone.
The primary zone contains unaltered primary minerals.
Mineral alterations.
Chalcopyrite CuFeS2 (primary) readily alters to the secondary minerals bornite Cu5FeS4, covellite CuS and brochantite Cu4SO4(OH)6.
Galena PbS (primary) alters to secondary anglesite PbSO4 and cerussite PbCO3. 
Sphalerite ZnS (primary) alters to secondary hemimorphite Zn4Si2O7(OH)2.H2O, smithsonite ZnCO3 and manganese-bearing willemite Zn2SiO4. 
Pyrite FeS2 (primary) alters to secondary melanterite FeSO4.7H2O.
If the original deposits contain arsenic and phosphorus bearing minerals secondary arsenates and phosphates will be formed.

Enyne metathesis

An Enyne metathesis is an organic reaction taking place between an alkyne and an alkene with a metal carbene catalyst forming a butadiene. This reaction is a variation of olefin metathesis.
The general scheme is given by "scheme 1":
When the reaction is intramolecular (in an enyne) it is called ring-closing enyne metathesis or RCEYM ("scheme 2"):
with Y representing oxygen or nitrogen and n an integer.
The reaction was first described in 1985 with the conversion of biphenyl 3.1 to a phenanthrene in "scheme 3":
The carbene is a tungsten carbonyl when used in stoichiometric amounts (1 equivalent) yields 41% of the phenanthrene 3.2 and when used in catalytic amounts phenanthrene 3.3. The stereoselectivity of this reaction is large with the metal atom exclusively adding to one of the alkyne carbon atoms in the initial reaction step.
Reaction mechanism.
The reaction mechanism for this reaction is outlined in scheme 4:
In the first catalytic cycle the alkyne group of enyne 4.1 forms a metallacyclobutene intermediate 4.3 with carbene 4.2 with R' and R' ' any organic group required to stabilized it. In the next step the metathesis step is reversed with formation of a new double bond and a new carbenic center in 4.4. The ring-closing step takes place when this center reacts with the alkene group to a metallacyclobutane 4.5 as in a regular olefin metathesis reaction. The butadiene group forms in the last step with expulsion of a new methylene carbene, initiating the next cycle but now with R' = H and R' ' = H.
This is the proposed "yne-then-ene" mechanism. Evidence for an "ene-then-yne" pathway is beginning to emerge, especially for ruthenium based catalytic systems.
The driving force for this conversion is the formation of a thermodynamically stable conjugated butadiene.
Scope.
Enyne metathesis reactions are accelerated by ethylene as is demonstrated in the reaction displayed in "scheme 5":
In this reaction with the Hoveyda-Grubbs Catalyst, ethylene converts the alkyne group to the corresponding diene group prior to the reaction with the alkene group.

NoLimits

NoLimits Roller Coaster Simulation is a software package available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X designed and built by a team of programmers and artists led by German programmer Ole Lange. It was first released in November 2001. The package includes two separate pieces of software, the NoLimits Editor and NoLimits Simulator, with a third application, the NoLimits Terraformer supported as well.
Software.
The 'NoLimits Editor' allows the design of a roller coaster with surrounding scenery. Track editing is based on adjacent bezier curves and allows nearly infinite design possibilities all packed in a CAD-based graphical user interface. Scenery objects can be placed in the editor, provided they are of the .3ds format. The software allows a number of popular roller coaster types to be designed, based on industrially engineered designs.
The Simulator allows the designed roller coaster to be viewed in full 3D, either riding the roller coaster like a rider, or watching it in a third person perspective, from a fixed position or behind the roller coaster train. 3D acceleration is provided by OpenGL. 
It is also possible to view technical information, such as speed and G-forces. These measurements are nearly exact to real-life situations.
The Terraformer allows the creation of a detailed landscape around the ride area, to simulate an actual environment. It has the ability to change the textures, water levels and placement of trees and other scenery to create a realistic environment. Some designers, who wish for a more flexible terrain design, create large 3D models of terrain, which allow for more complicated elements such as tunnels, buildings, and pathways. The Terraformer was created by Gravimetric Studios for use in the package, and is considered a third party application for use with the official suite.
Industrial use.
According to the NoLimits official website, the software has been used by amusement park related companies showcasing new rides for prospective parks and guests. Such companies include Vekoma, Intamin, Gerstlauer, MACK Rides, and Zamperla.
Companies have been licensing roller coaster styles to NoLimits including:
It has also been modified as a proof of concept for certain prototype rides, including the UniCoaster prototype. A demo can be downloaded from the website, which is a customized version of the NoLimits Simulator.
Available types of roller coaster.
Due to the free form style of the Editor and the CAD based interface the creation of different types of roller coasters is not limited by the style of track chosen for the simulation, and as such Wooden roller coasters can have the same elements as a Steel roller coaster, whilst not being "true to life". Below is a list of the track types (with train combinations) that are included in the Simulator.
Notes
Third Party Software.
Nolimits Track Packager
Allows the user to create a package file containing car-textures, environments and scenery files using a track file.
Newton 2 was released on 20 September 2009. Newton 2 is a Nolimits 1.* add-on that allows you to create roller coaster track using mathematical formulas; This method of track building is commonly referred to as "Force Vector Design". This is where you specify the g-forces you want to achieve and then Newton 2 will then shape the track to hit those forces.
There are many programs designed for No Limits, e.g.: No Limits Construction Kit, No Limits Elementary e.t.c next to Newton 2.
Future version: "NoLimits 2".
Creator Ole Lange has mentioned on his personal website that Nolimits Coaster 2 will offer to fix some of the outstanding bugs in the original Nolimits coaster. No longer will it have 2 separate applications, but rather have a more WYSIWYG approach. Other features include: package management
Ole has said that he plans to maintain the NL1.x project while NL2 is still too far away.
NoLimits 2 was released on january 10th 2014.

James A. FitzPatrick

James Anthony Fitzpatrick (February 26, 1894 – June 12, 1980) was an American producer, director, writer and narrator, known from the early 1930s as "The Voice of the Globe."
Biography.
James Anthony Fitzpatrick was born in Shelton, Connecticut. After completing training in dramatic arts, he worked, for a while, as a journalist. In 1916, he entered in films by starting the Juvenile Film Company in Cleveland, producing comedy shorts featuring children and anticipating by years similar series such as Our Gang and The Little Rascals. However, the series was not a success; by 1921, FitzPatrick was working as a writer/director in Charles Urban's American Kineto concern, making a series entitled "Great American Authors" which featured profiles of famous American writers. Kineto folded, however, in 1924, and in 1925 FitzPatrick established his own company and undertook two concurrent series, "Famous Music Masters"—fictionalized shorts about the lives of famous composers—and "Songs of." These were distributed worldwide, and some were later synchronized to sound.
In 1930, FitzPatrick began filming travel documentaries for British and American viewers.MGM distributed the series under the umbrella title "Fitzpatrick Traveltalks." From 1934's "Holland in Tulip Time," the TravelTalks were shot in Technicolor, making this series one of the first regular vehicles for color film in the American film industry. After FitzPatrick and MGM parted company in 1954, he went to Paramount, producing a similar "Vistavision Visits" series for about another year before retiring. He died at the age of 86 in Cathedral City, California.
Legacy.
FitzPatrick made nearly 300 films in a career that spanned five decades. He was, in some ways, the heir to Charles Urban's approach to making travelogues: they concentrated on the picturesque elements of a nation visited—architecture and landscape—and not, so much, the people. IMDB reproduces an unsourced quote from FitzPatrick which reads,
""How would I have gained admittance to those countries if I had commented on their social problems? [...] I made my pictures at a time when travel was almost impossible for the average person. I believe I showed people what they would have wanted to see if they could have gone themselves. [...] I don't recall anyone ever requesting a tour of slums and prisons.""
Fitzpatrick also relates to Charles Urban in his advocacy of color, which he first employed in "Charles Gounod" (1928), a film in the Famous Music Master Series.
With the coming of television, Hollywood began to reduce their reliance on short subjects and many shorts departments began to close; FitzPatrick owned his own unit and managed to survive longer than many internal studio units, but the writing was on the wall by the time he bowed out. FitzPatrick Pictures only produced five features, and three of these intended for release only in the UK; the last one, "Song of Mexico" (1945) was released by Republic Pictures. In the twenty-first century, the Traveltalks are notable for preserving cityscapes before many of them had skyscrapers or international hotel chains, and ways of life that are now defunct, though these are presented in a very general way. The TravelTalks are often shown yet today on Turner Classic Movies as filler material between features.

<doc id="5954041" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954041" title="The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays">
The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays

The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays was an early attempt to bring L. Frank Baum's Oz books to the motion picture screen. It was a mixture of live actors, hand-tinted magic lantern slides, and film. Baum himself would appear as if he were giving a lecture, while he interacted with the characters (both on stage and on screen). Due to financial problems—the show cost more to make than sold-out houses could bring in—the show folded after two months of performances. It opened in Grand Rapids, Michigan on September 24, 1908. It later moved to New York City, where it reportedly closed December 16, 1908. It was scheduled to run through December 31, and ads for it continued to run in "The New York Times" until then.
Michael Radio Color.
The films were colored (credited as "illuminations") by Duval Frères of Paris, in a process known as "Radio-Play", and were noted for being the most lifelike hand-tinted imagery of the time. Baum once claimed in an interview that a "Michael Radio" was a Frenchman who colored the films, though no evidence of such a person, even with the more proper French spelling "Michel", as second-hand reports unsurprisingly revise it, has been documented. It did not refer to the contemporary concept of radio (or, for that matter, a radio play), but played on notions of the new and fantastic at the time, similar to the way "high-tech" or sometimes "cyber" would be used later in the century. The "Fairylogue" part of the title was to liken it to a travelogue, which at the time was a very popular type of documentary film entertainment.
Original film score.
The production also included a full original score consisting of 27 cues by Nathaniel D. Mann, who had previously set a couple of Baum's songs in "The Wizard of Oz" musical. It debuted four months before Camille Saint-Saëns's score for "The Assassination of the Duke of Guise", and is therefore the earliest original film score to be documented.
Adaptation.
It was based on Baum's books "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", "The Marvelous Land of Oz", "Ozma of Oz" and "John Dough and the Cherub", with intermission slides showing previews of "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz", which was not sold in stores until near the end of the run. Francis Boggs directed the Oz material and Otis Turner directed "John Dough and the Cherub". Baum, in a white suit, would step behind the screen and into the film, pulling his actors off to appear on stage with him. Surviving production stills depict a very large cast of Oz characters. Romola Remus was the silver screen's first Dorothy. Will Morrison is credited with the role of Tip, but a William Gillespie was interviewed in "The Baum Bugle" about the role, and he introduced a discrepancy as to whether Ozma was played by Maud Harrington as credited or Delilah Leitzell, as Gillespie remembers. Notably absent from this production is the Woggle-Bug, who was the title character of a failed musical three years prior.
Cast.
"(listed in the order credited in the program)"
Production.
"The New York Times" included a write-up of the show in a full-page article in a late 1909 issue, over a year after the show had come and gone, probably because they finally had space for it after it was no longer necessary but still of interest. When the production appeared in New York, the "Times"' listing for it appeared along with the plays, not with the films, drawing attention to the fact that Baum, not to mention the rest of the cast, would be appearing live on stage with the films as a major, though far from the only, component.
"The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays" was produced by "The Radio-Play Company of America", John B. Shaw, Jr., general manager. The sets were designed and painted by E. Pollack. The costumes were designed by Fritz Schultz and Chicago Costuming Co.. Properties and papier-mâché work by Charles van Duzen. Mechanical effects by Paul Dupont. Wigs by Hepner. Shoes by Marshall Field & Co. Jewels loaned by C.D. Peacock.
The Selig Polyscope Company was involved in the production of the films. This led to erroneous conclusions that "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and its sequels were derived from the materials of this film, which was disproven with the discovery of that film, which bears little resemblance to the surviving materials of Fairylogue. Otis Turner is believed to be the director of both film versions of "John Dough and the Cherub", both lost. It may be possible that they were one and the same film, but highly unlikely, as "Fairylogue" was most likely the singular print eventually discarded by the Baum family after its decomposition.

<doc id="5954083" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954083" title="Oklahoma Christian School">
Oklahoma Christian School

Oklahoma Christian School (OCS) is an independent, private school located in Edmond, Oklahoma serving grades Pre K-12. It is accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) and fully recognized by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
OCS is a faith-based college preparatory school promoting academic preparation, Christian values and character development. The school's motto is "To Partner with Families to Educate the Whole Student to the Glory of God". Almost all OCS graduates go on to attend college, and while most attend public Oklahoma universities like Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma and University of Central Oklahoma, others go to private schools, other regional schools, and out of state. OCS graduates often find success in college because of the strong academic foundation they received, and go on to a range of careers, including business, law, medicine, academia and ministry. Some OCS graduates also go on to play collegiate sports like football, basketball and tennis. The most notable example is NBA star Blake Griffin, who won 4 consecutive state championships at OCS, then played for the University of Oklahoma before being drafted number 1 overall to play for the Clippers. OCS consistently has strong showings in football, basketball, golf and tennis, including a 2012 football state championship. 
History.
Oklahoma Christian School, originally known as the "Christian Center School", was founded in Fall 1970 and operated as an arm of the Christian Conquest Center Church in Oklahoma City. During the 1974-75 school year, the church decided to terminate the operation of the school as an arm of the church. Interested parents and teachers decided that the school must continue. The reorganized, independent school was incorporated as Oklahoma Christian Schools, Inc. on January 13, 1975.
Thirteen seniors composed the Class of 1976, the school's first. In 1987, OCS moved to the MetroChurch campus in east Edmond, Oklahoma.
After renting facilities for approximately 20 years, OCS completed its first major building project in 1991-92. It included a gym complex, with eight new classrooms added in 1995. The facility also houses a band room, science laboratories and the middle school administrative offices.
In 2000, after MetroChurch merged with Life Church (also in Edmond), the school began to convert church facilities to fully functional educational facilities.
OCS completed its multi-purpose Student Center at the end of the 2007-2008 school year. This building, the first phase in OCS's campus expansion, houses a cafeteria, band room, classrooms, concession stand, football locker rooms, and a secondary gymnasium. The OCS Master Plan includes a long-term expansion plan that will eventually move OCS out of many of its present buildings into new facilities.
Academics.
OCS is of comparable quality to nearby Edmond North High School, one of the best public high schools in the state (3rd strongest in the state according to US News rankings). Parents choose OCS over North for the more closely knit environment, the safety of the campus and the opportunity for their children to learn about the Christian faith in the context of their formal education. OCS welcomes and encourages parents to be involved in the school, and offers SPO (Saints' Parents Organization) and the Barnabas Club for parents to participate in. Students at OCS will also experience significantly less exposure, if any at all, to drugs and alcohol, as OCS has very strict policies against illegal substances. 
One noted weakness of the academic curriculum at OCS is the absence of AP (advanced placement) coursework allowing students to take tests for college credit, a program that other area schools (like Edmond North) offer. OCS is actively addressing this need, and have already made moves to offer AP history by bringing a UCO history professor on-site. The main goal of OCS education is Christian education, and if AP classes can't be taught by instructors sharing the same goals, then AP classes can't happen. 
OCS typically sees students score well on tests like the ACT and the PSAT, but as with any school, there is a range of student ability and thus a range of scores. In 2010, for example, OCS had 3 of 60 seniors become National Merit Scholars based on their PSAT scores, putting them in the top 1% of scores in Oklahoma. That same year, there was a group of students scoring 30 and above on the ACT. The Oklahoma average for ACT test takers is a 20.7 according to act.org, while the average at OCS is a 25 and Edmond North is a 24.2 according to ok.gov.
Chapel.
OCS has a chapel program under the leadership of the chapel council—class chaplains and the STUCO Chaplain(s). This is a time of student-led worship, Bible reading, and messages either from administrators or outside speakers. It is not a non-denominational time, but rather an inter-denominational time in which students from all denominations are equally respected. Chapel is traditionally held every Wednesday, and classes on that day are each shortened to make time for the event.
HEROES Week.
OCS students and faculty of all grades (Pre-K through Seniors) reserve one week of every school year to raise money for a charitable cause. HEROES stands for Hands Extended Reflecting Our Exalted Savior. Recipients have ranged from OCS students to families outside the student body to Westwood Elementary School in Oklahoma City to the No Boundaries International Missions Group in Sierra Leone, Africa. This week consists of many events such as movie night, a date auction, flamingo football, and teacher auction (teachers auction off notes, quizzes, tardy passes and homemade items). The largest grossing item to date is a seven-course homemade gourmet Italian dinner that collected over $300 a plate. At the end of the week, the school assembles in an all-school chapel assembly, and after worship songs and scripture readings, the check is presented to the families or the organization representative.
Robotics Team.
OCS is also home to FIRST Robotics Competition team number 3169. The "Saint-Borgs" have been competing for 3 seasons. Their latest robot, Hellen Kepler, performed in the semifinals of Rebound Rumble at the Oklahoma City regional competition.

<doc id="5954084" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954084" title="Thomas Stewart (bishop)">
Thomas Stewart (bishop)

Thomas Stewart was an illegitimate son of King Robert II of Scotland. In 1380, Avignon Pope Clement VII provided Thomas with the Archdeaconry of the Bishopric of St. Andrews, as well as the canonry (and prebend) of Stobo in the Bishopric of Glasgow. In 1389, the king petitioned and obtained for Thomas from the Pope the right to hold the deanery of the Bishopric of Dunkeld along with his other offices, and in 1393, the Pope provided a canonry in the Bishopric of Brechin. In this period, Archdeacon Thomas obtained a Bachelor of Canon Law at the University of Paris.
On 1 July 1401, following the death of Walter Trail, Bishop of St. Andrews, Thomas was elected to fill the see's vacancy. However, because of the problems experienced by Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, who was being besieged by the King of France, Thomas had problems obtaining Papal confirmation. In this context, Thomas' election fell victim to the political struggles of the time. Thomas was supported by his nephew, David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, who actively campaigned in the region of St. Andrews during the year 1401. However, this aligned him against his half-brother, Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany. In order to obtain control of Dumbarton Castle, the Duke of Albany offered its keeper, Walter de Danyelston, the semi-vacant see of St. Andrews. After a meeting between Albany and the Bishop elect at Abernethy in the summer of 1402, Thomas renounced his rights as Bishop and allowed a new "election" to take place.

The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (opera)

The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a one-act chamber opera by Michael Nyman to an English-language libretto by Christopher Rawlence, adapted from the case study of the same name by Oliver Sacks by Nyman, Rawlence, and Michael Morris. It was first performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, on 27 October 1986.
The minimalist score makes use of songs by Robert Schumann, in particular, "Ich grolle nicht" from "Dichterliebe", in which Dr. S. accompanies Dr. P., singing the ossia as a descant. Mrs. P. plays the piano, the actor actually playing if possible.
Synopsis.
The plot concerns the investigation by a neurologist of the condition of a singer who suffers from visual agnosia. According to the liner notes, Morris, Rawlence, and Nyman had to spend much time convincing the real Mrs. P. (whose husband is implied to have been a known name) that they were not proposing a musical (her word) that would trivialize her late husband's situation in order to gain her consent.
Film.
Rawlence made a film version in 1987. It made brief omissions from the music (most notably the self-referential line, "That's Nyman! Can't mistake his body rhythm," when Dr. P. is watching television) and added documentary segments with Sacks and pathologist John Tighe working with the actual Dr. P.'s brain. They reveal that his condition was the result of Alzheimer's Disease that atypically affected only one portion of his brain until its latter stages. Unusually for an opera film not shot on a theatre stage, the singing was recorded live on-set by boom operators.
Returning from the original cast were Emile Belcourt as Dr. S. and Frederick Westcott as Dr. P. Patricia Hooper replaced Sarah Leonard as Mrs. P. The Michael Nyman Band appeared on-screen as Dr. P.'s students. Originally distributed on VHS by Films, Inc., its rarity has caused it to become a popular bootleg favorite.
Recording.
CBS Masterworks MK44669 (1987); Emile Belcourt (tenor), Sarah Leonard (soprano), Frederick Westcott (baritone), Alexander Balanescu (first violin), Jonathan Carney (second violin), Kate Musker (viola), Moray Welsh (first cello), Anthony Hinnigan (second cello), Helen Tunstall (harp), conducted by the composer. Carney, Musker, and Hinnigan, who will make up the first lineup of the Balanescu Quartet, make their first of many appearances on a Nyman album with this release.

International Men's Health Week

International Men's Health Week is an international week celebrated in several countries to focus on issues facing men's health. International Men's Health Week began at an international level in 2002 when representatives from six men's health organizations around the world met at the 2nd World Congress on Men's Health in Vienna, Austria and resolved to work together to launch International Men's Health Week (IMHW.)
Observers of Men’s Health Week are sometimes seen wearing a blue ribbon as a symbol of their support for the fight against prostate cancer. However, problems affecting men's health extend far beyond prostate cancer and other commonly recognized men's illnesses. Physicians and men's health activists mark Men's Health Week with awareness campaigns to highlight additional health concerns such as diabetes, osteoperosis, family health, workplace accidents, and men's higher likelihood of suicide or being a victim of homicide.
Vienna Declaration.
The European Men's Health Forum returned to Austria in 2005 to create the Vienna Declaration which serves as a plan of action for improving the state of men's health. According to the Society for Men's Health and Gender, the five main points of the Vienna Declaration are:
Participants.
The aim of IMHW is slightly wider than its domestic equivalent, aiming to increase awareness of general male health issues and to encourage inter- and intra-national institutions to provide better care for health issues affecting men around the world. Some affiliates of IMHW include The Men's Health Forum in England and Wales, Men's Health Society of BC, in British Columbia, Rotary International, the San Maarten Public Health Department in the Netherlands Antilles, the Men's Health Information and Resource Centre in Australia and Men's Health Network in the United States. Men's Health Network also hosts the website for IMHW.
Although IMHW is most widely observed in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States, there has been collaboration with reproductive and sexual health programs for men in Central and South America, Africa, and Asia as well.
Because men's health is still an emerging issue, IMHW has been helpful in bringing awareness of the issue to areas where men's health has yet to become accepted. Countries in which men's health has come to be viewed as a more legitimate concern have collaborated with men's health activists elsewhere.
History.
Men's Health Week.
Men’s Health Week, celebrated annually during the week preceding and including Father’s Day, honors the importance of men's health and wellness. Men's Health Week was chosen for this specific time of year to make use of the extra attention paid to male family members near the holiday. Observing Men's Health Week is meant to educate the public about what can be done to improve the state of men's health and provide free and convenient health services to men who wouldn't otherwise receive such care.
Men's Health Week was created by Congress in 1994 to heighten awareness of preventable health problems and encourage early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys. The bills creating Men’s Health Week were sponsored by former Senator Bob Dole and former Congressman Bill Richardson. The sponsors cited the cost-effectiveness of a shift from treatment to prevention in health care emphasis when presenting the bill. The supporters of Men's Health Week also noted that prevention requires public awareness and designating a week would spread information on preventing illnesses affecting men. 
The governors of the states and territories in the USA have adopted the week, as have the mayors of many of the major cities. The proclamations are display on the Men's Health Week website. Typical Men’s Health Week events include educational lectures by sports figures, free health screenings, health fairs, and seminars. Men's Health Week events are planned so that they are easily attended even by men with a full work schedule. Although not officially recognized by congress, men’s health activists observe Men’s Health Month throughout June.
Internationalisation.
Men’s Health Week expanded to an international level when representatives from six men's health organizations around the world met at the 2nd World Congress on Men's Health in Vienna, Austria in 2002 and resolved to work together to launch International Men's Health Week (IMHW). The aim of IMHW is slightly wider than its domestic equivalent, aiming to increase awareness of general male health issues and to encourage inter- and intra-national institutions to provide better care for health issues affecting men around the world. Some affiliates of IMHW include The Men’s Health Forum in England and Wales, The Men's Health Forum Scotland (MHFS), Australasian Men's Health Forum and Men's Health Society of BC, in British Columbia, Rotary International, and the San Maarten Public Health Department in the Netherlands Antilles.

Climax (Slum Village song)

"Climax (Girl Shit)" (also known as "Climax") was the second single to be released by Slum Village from their album "Fantastic, Vol. 2". The song features sexually-themed verses from the three members of the group and a chorus sung by Slum Village member Baatin's older sister, who also has a brief cameo in the music video for the song. Despite the song's title, the songs lyrics, concerning a ménage à trois, are playfully delivered and steer clear of any overly crude language. The song was relatively popular but was severely delayed as a single, and thus failed to fully capitalize on the album's initial buzz.
Overview.
Concept.
During a 2000 Radio 1 performance of the song in Ayia Napa, Baatin further explained the concept behind the song:
Video.
The single was released along with a music video which featured cameos from The Roots frontman Questlove, Amp Fiddler, and actor Gary Coleman. In the beginning of the video, the three members of the group meet store clerk Coleman, who proceeds to boast that although "I may be half the man, but I'm gonna need twice the ladies". The fellas chuckle at Coleman and halfheartedly dismiss his comments before leaving the store and taking separate routes. Each member then performs their part of the song over cellphones to their as yet unseen partners while making their way across town, during which several musicians (such as Amp Fiddler) make their cameos.
The vocalist singing the chorus, Airasoul (formerly known as Tina Marie of "Timeless", a song from Dwele's independent promo CD, "Rize"), also makes her appearance in the video, carrying 3 roses out of a store, right before the verse of her real-life brother and Slum Village group member, Baatin. Finally the trio arrive at adjacent bungalows to meet their partners only to discover, one-by-one, that they have extra company, in the form of football player Simeon Rice; rapper Saafir, and "Convenience Store Superpimp" Coleman himself.

Harris v Nickerson

Harris v Nickerson (1873) LR 8 QB 286 is an English law case concerning the requirements of offer and acceptance in the formation of a contract. The case established that an advertisement that goods will be put up for auction does not constitute an offer to any person that the goods will actually be put up, and that the advertiser is therefore free to withdraw the goods from the auction at any time prior to the auction. All three judges concurred but issued separate judgments.
Facts.
The Defendant placed an advertisement in London papers that certain items, including brewing equipment and office furniture, would be placed up for auction over three days in Bury St. Edmunds. The Plaintiff obtained a commission to buy the office furniture and expended time and expense to travel to Bury St. Edmunds to bid for the office furniture. On the third day, the lots for the office furniture were withdrawn. The Plaintiff sued for loss of time and expense. The judge at first instance found in favour of the Plaintiff. Leave was given to appeal to the High Court.
The Plaintiff submitted that the advertisement constituted a contract between themselves and the Defendant that the latter would sell the furniture according to the conditions stated in the advertisement, and that accordingly the withdrawal of the furniture was a breach of contract. The Defendant submitted the advertisement of a sale did not constitute a contract that any particular lot or class of lots would actually be put up for sale.
Judgment.
The court held unanimously that the advertisement did not constitute an offer, but rather was a mere declaration of intent. Blackburn, J. founded his judgment on public policy grounds, calling it a "startling proposition" that "any one who advertises a sale by publishing an advertisement become responsible to everybody who attends the sale for his cab hire or travelling expenses". Quain and Archibald, JJ. also drew public policy arguments, emphasising that there existed no authority on which to base a decision that the Defendant be liable to indemnify all those who attended his auction. The court upheld the appeal.

Yousif plays mainly as an offensive midfielder and sometimes as a striker. He is currently retired from playing with the Bahrain national football team, where he made 21 appearances in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches.
Early career.
Talal started off his career with a small club Isa Town. Known as Madinat Isa, this is the club that produced fellow Bahraini football star Salman Ghuloom, known as Salman Isa. At one point Talal captained the Isa Town squad.

Asian Cup.
During the 2004 Asian Cup, Talal Yousif peaked and put on his best performances. He scored two goals, one coming from his trademark free kick against fierce rivals Iran in the 3rd and 4th place playoff.

Vrčin

Vrčin (Serbian Cyrillic: Врчин) is a suburban settlement of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Grocka.
Geography.
Vrčin is located southeast of the Avala mountain, in the central-eastern part of the municipality, 20 km southeast of Belgrade and 14 km west of the municipal seat of Grocka. It is situated in the spring area of the Bolečica river and it is a major crossroad being located on the railway Belgrade-Požarevac, the highway Belgrade-Niš, regional road connecting the highway and the road of "Smederevski put" (through Zaklopača) and another one connecting the highway and the Belgrade-Kragujevac road.
Neighborhoods.
Vrčin has several neighborhoods of its own. They can be roughly divided in two sections, north and south of the highway.
North section:
South section:
Economy.
Despite recent development of workshops and the commercial sector (including building of a shopping mall in the center of the settlement), the economy is mostly based on agriculture.
Politics.
Vrčin was the seat of its own municipality which was disbanded and incorporated into the municipality of Grocka. From time to time, a motions of separating Vrčin from Grocka again appear in the public, due to the distance from its municipal seat and a fact that it is more populous than Grocka. Most recent idea is that Vrčin and several settlement from the Voždovac municipality (Zuce, Pinosava, Ripanj, Beli Potok) create a new, sub-Avalan municipality of Avalski Venac.
Population.
Vrčin is statistically classified as a rural settlement (village) and officially is the second most populous settlement in the municipality (Census 2002; after Kaluđerica but before municipal seat of Grocka). However, unofficial estimates including number of refugees (not counted in the official census reports) also put Leštane before Vrčin.
Vrčin extends on both sides of the highway (originally developed from the western side), the eastern extension colloquially being named Tranšped (Cyrillic: Траншпед). This area forms a continuous build-up area with Zaklopača. Vrčin experiences a steady growth of population:

NTDEC

Nintendo Electronic Co. (任天堂電子有限公司) or NTDEC, was a Taiwanese manufacturer of video game cartridges, accessories and original games for the NES and Famicom. They also manufactured Famicom to NES converters to play Famicom games on the NES. The company was founded in 1983 (according to the Asder official website), but in the 80's its activities were and are still today unknown.
Piracy.
NTDEC produced a large number of pirated copies of games between 1989 and 1991, which were sold in Asia and in the USA via mail order. Unusually among pirate cartridge manufacturers, NTDEC cartridges are often identifiable by the company logo on the cartridge and the in-game copyright noticed modified to read "NTDEC", as well as the rear label featuring a green "QUALITY GUARANTY" (sic) stripe. Legal action was brought against the company by Nintendo in 1993 for its activities in the US, as well as its use of the "Nintendo" trademark in its company name.
Original games.
Between 1991 and 1993, NTDEC published a number of original games in Asia, some of which were distributed in parts of South America and Europe. Many of these games are credited to Mega Soft, although it is unknown if this a separate entity to NTDEC. Six games previously released by NTDEC/Mega Soft in 1991 were compiled on the "Caltron 6 in 1" cartridge in 1992, which was distributed in the US - since this cartridge contains only NTDEC/Mega Soft games and carries the same CN-xx ID as the previous original NTDEC games, Caltron is believed to be the same company as NTDEC.
Asder.
Following the legal action of 1993, the company appears to have ceased operations under the NTDEC name. Another Taiwanese company, Asder Electronic Co., Ltd (亞斯德科技有限公司), has released educational computer systems and TV game joypads containing Mega Soft games, and several original Famicom titles continuing NTDEC's CN-xx numbering. However, is unknown whether this company is in fact NTDEC under a new name, or a separate company that obtained the rights to NTDEC's past titles.
List of games.
Note: The Hacker game Master Shooter, included only in "Asder 20-in-1", is the hack of the game of the same name (listed in the same compilation as Shooter: Part1).

Kevin Long attended University of South Carolina and was a standout fullback for the Gamecocks. He rushed for 2,372 yards, 8th overall on Carolina's all-time list as of 2006. His average per rush was 5.3 yards and he was the first Gamecock player to compile 1,000 yards in a season (1975). In 2002, Kevin was inducted into the University of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame, and in 2003, into the State of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.
NFL/USFL.
Kevin was drafted in the 7th round (195th overall) by the New York Jets in the 1977 NFL Draft and played five solid seasons for the Jets, until 1981. However, he is probably best remembered as a former USFL player. He played three seasons in the newly formed league, first for the Chicago Blitz in 1983, and then for the Arizona Wranglers in 1984. Due to the full-team trade that occurred during the first off-season between Chicago and Arizona, the 1984 Arizona team was basically the same team that had played in Chicago in 1983. After the 1984 season, Arizona then merged with the Oklahoma Outlaws franchise, and Kevin played for the new Arizona Outlaws team in 1985.
Current status.
Today, Kevin works in sales for a vending machine company. He is married and has three daughters. His eldest daughter won a track and field scholarship to the University of Georgia. His second daughter plays volleyball at the College of Charleston.

Julian Pettifer

Julian Pettifer OBE (born 21 July 1935 in Malmesbury, England) is a British television journalist. He was President of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and is Vice President of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. He was voted Bafta 'Reporter of the Year' for his coverage of the war in Vietnam in 1968. 
Biography.
After Marlborough College and St John's College, Cambridge, he started work in television during the early days of ITV, as one of the original Southern Television announcers in 1958. He later moved to the BBC as a globe-trotting reporter for programmes such as "Tonight", "24 Hours" and "Panorama". 
He was the host for the British television show Busman's Holiday (game show) from 1985 to 1988. The show was produced by Granada Television and ran on the ITV network. 
Pettifer also wrote and presented a number of documentaries for both BBC and ITV, including "Diamonds in the Sky", on the subject of international air travel; "Automania", a history of the motor car, and "Missionaries".
A growing interest in the environment led to him writing and presenting programmes about the environment and wildlife including "Naturewatch" for Central Television, "Nature", and "The Living Isles" for the BBC. He continued to report on current affairs, contributing reports for BBC Two's "Assignment" and "Correspondent" programmes, and a highly-praised film for Channel 4 that re-examined the reporting of the Vietnam war. He presented BBC Radio 4's "Asiafile" and now presents their "Crossing Continents".
Pettifer was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1990 and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.

De Haas–van Alphen effect

The de Haas–van Alphen effect, often abbreviated to dHvA, is a quantum mechanical effect in which the magnetic moment of a pure metal crystal oscillates as the intensity of an applied magnetic field B is increased. Other quantities also oscillate, such as the resistivity (Shubnikov–de Haas effect), specific heat, and sound attenuation and speed. It was discovered in 1930 by Wander Johannes de Haas and his student P. M. van Alphen.
The period, when plotted against formula_1, is inversely proportional to the area formula_2 of the extremal orbit of the Fermi surface, in the direction of the applied field.
where S is the area of the Fermi surface normal to the direction of B.
This effect is due to Landau quantization of electron energy in an applied magnetic field. A strong magnetic field — typically several teslas — and a low temperature are required to cause a material to exhibit the dHvA effect.
In 1952, Lars Onsager explained the physics behind the effect, and, due to his interpretation, this effect can be used to image the Fermi surface of a metal, to measure the carrier density and more, which makes this a very powerful probing technique in condensed-matter physics.

Gensō Suikogaiden

The events of the game intersect with those of "Suikoden II", but are more of a side story, hence the name "gaiden".
Volume 1: Swordsman of Harmonia.
Nash Latkje, the protagonist controlled by the player and an agent of Holy Harmonia's Southern Border Defence Force, has been assigned to obtain information to either verify or disprove a rumour concerning the appearance of one of the 27 True Runes in the Jowston City States. During his travels, he encounters Sierra Mikain, a female vampire, who decides to accompany him on his journey. As a result, he soon becomes entangled in the larger conflict involving the events of "Suikoden II".
Volume 2: Duel at Crystal Valley.
After the completion of the Dunan Unification Wars (the events of "Suikoden II"), Nash intends to return to the capital of Holy Harmonia, the Crystal Valley. However, his travels involve more adventure than he anticipates.
His journey involves traveling through the Grasslands, where one village happens to be celebrating the legend of the Flame Champion and the Fire Bringers who stopped the Harmonians from invading some sixty years ago; an unfortunate stop over in Caleria, the base of operations for mercenaries of Southern Harmonian Border Defence Force; helping stop a wild dragon from terrorizing a village before finally reaching his destination.
As "Volume 2" was released roughly a year before "Suikoden III", it presumably helped set up and introduce the Grasslands, which were the main focus of "Suikoden III". Nash also returns in "Suikoden III"; outside of Japan, "Suikoden III" is Nash's first appearance in the series.
Development.
The "Suikogaiden" games were made by a separate development group at Konami. After "Duel at Crystal Valley" was completed, the "Suikoden III" team and the "Suikogaiden" team merged and began work on both "Suikoden IV" and "Suikoden V".
English localization.
As of September 2013, a fan translation of the both games has been produced and released to the public by a group of Suikoden enthusiastic fans, lead by RinUzuki. The latest patches can be downloaded from their project wiki site.

<doc id="5954216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954216" title="Dolorian">
Dolorian

Dolorian is a doom metal band from Oulu, Finland. Their early recordings are viewed as some of the earliest examples of blackened doom metal. Later recordings mixed dark ambient music with the traditional doom metal style.
The band was founded in mid-1997 as a duo consisting of A. Haapapuro and A. Kukkohovi. Their combination of varied songs, structures and melodies, several vocal styles, and obscure spiritual lyrics set the band apart from many others in their genre.
Dolorian recorded their first demos in autumn 1997 at Tico-Tico Studios with temporary keyboard player H. Riihinen. They were subsequently signed with Wounded Love Records. In April 1998 the band, along with their new keyboard player J. Ontero, recorded the debut album "When All the Laughter Has Gone". The album was released in 1999. The following year, the band recorded their second album. Entitled simply "Dolorian", it was a continuation of the black doom sound of their debut, although with much quieter vocals. The self-titled album, considering the raw black/doom sound of the first album, "Dolorian", blurs the boundaries of clear classification by instilling a more psychedelic and ambient backdrop. 
In 2002, Dolorian recorded songs for a split release with Shining, but record label problems delayed its release until 2004. In 2006, the band released their third album, "Voidwards", which demonstrated a further shift in their sound and included the usage of dark ambient elements. Their latest album is a blend of sounds from their previous releases. On the one hand there are long passages of ambient, psychedelic rock, with heavy flange, and clean vocals: on the other hand, there are loud blackened doom metal passages to contrast the atmospheric stylations, with a blend of two harsh vocals (one high and raspy, the other deep and growly), heavy distortion, and blaring synthesizers.
The band's website has been updated infrequently since 2006. All of its members are involved in dark ambient projects, which has likely shifted their concentration away from Dolorian.

Jean Délémontez

Jean Délémontez (born June 9, 1918) is a French aircraft designer. He was born in Lyon. He is best known for his work with his father-in-law, Édouard Joly, on the Jodel range of light aircraft and his collaboration with Pierre Robin on the Avions Robin aircraft range.
Career.
In 1935, Jean Delemontez joined the French airforce, where, despite numerous tries, he never managed to become a pilot. This due to the fact that his mechanical competences were recognized all too soon. In 1936, he had already designed his first aircraft, the D1. After a study at the Rochefort school of mechanics, he is assigned maintenance duties at the fighter aircraft of that time. In 1941, he enters the design bureau of the airforce in Toulouse. At night, he proceeds with his own designs and two years later, he starts working for Amiot. He works at the design bureau, before joining Edouard Joly at his company for repairing agricultural machines. It is with Joly that in 1946 la société des avions Jodel is started.
In December 2000, Délémontez was inducted into the Experimental Aircraft Association Homebuilders' Hall of Fame.

Stuart Morgan

Stuart Edward Morgan (born 23 September 1949 in Swansea) is a Welsh former professional footballer and football manager. A central defender, he made 222 appearances in the Football League playing for Torquay United, Reading, Colchester United and A.F.C. Bournemouth. As manager, he took charge of Torquay United in the Football League and Weymouth (twice) and Dorchester Town in non-League football.
Career.
Morgan joined West Ham United as a junior, turning professional in March 1967. However, he was never to make the West Ham first team. He joined Torquay United on loan in February 1969, making his league debut on 15 February in a 2-1 win at home to Watford. He remained at Plainmoor until the end of the season, playing 14 league games.
In November 1969, Morgan moved to Reading where he played 46 times before moving to Colchester United in August 1972. He scored twelve times in 81 league games for Colchester, captaining them to promotion under manager Jim Smith in 1974 before moving to A.F.C. Bournemouth in March 1975.
He was appointed manager of Weymouth in November 1978, guiding them to second place in the Alliance Premier League in 1979-80. He left Weymouth in November 1983, returning to Bournemouth as part of Harry Redknapp's coaching staff, where he remained until September 1985 when Morgan was appointed as manager of Torquay United. Torquay finished bottom of Division Four that season, the last before automatic relegation to the Conference would begin. The next season Torquay struggled again and only survived on the last day of the season, at Lincoln City's expense, thanks to a late winner against Crewe Alexandra from Paul Dobson in injury time added after Torquay defender Jim McNichol had been bitten by a police dog.
Morgan resigned in May 1987 and the following month began his second spell as manager of Weymouth. He took 'The Terras' to second place in the league before a flooded Wessex Stadium pitch meant that they did not play for six weeks, thus losing their momentum. Morgan then joined forces with Harry Redknapp again, as Chief Scout of AFC Bournemouth, where they enjoyed a lot of success.
In August 1993 he was appointed as manager of Dorchester Town, where he took 'The Magpies' to their highest ever Southern Premier League finish, but was sacked in September 1999 after a 3-0 defeat in the FA Cup qualifying rounds to a Taunton Town side that contained manager Russell Musker and four players, Tom Kelly, Mark Loram, Chris Myers, and Darren Cann, all of whom he had signed while manager of Torquay.
He later worked as a scout for West Ham United and Portsmouth and is currently a full-time scout for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

Readercon

Readercon is an annual science fiction convention, held every July in the Boston, Massachusetts area, in Burlington, Massachusetts). It was founded by Bob Colby and statistician Eric Van in the mid-1980s with the goal of focusing almost exclusively on science fiction/fantasy/slipstream/speculative fiction in the written form (on the rare occasion that there is a discussion held about non-written science fiction, it will have a tongue-in-cheek title such as "Our biannual media panel"). Past guests of honor have included authors such as Greer Gilman, Gene Wolfe, Octavia Butler, Samuel R. Delany, Karen Joy Fowler, Brian Aldiss, Nalo Hopkinson, Joe Haldeman, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Peter Straub, and China Miéville, and editors such as Ellen Datlow and David G. Hartwell. The convention also makes a point of honoring a deceased author as the Memorial Guest of Honor. In 2009, for instance, the guests of honor were the living writers Elizabeth Hand and Greer Gilman and the memorial guest of honor was Hope Mirrlees.
Total attendance at the convention has been consistently around 850 for many years.
From 2005 to 2011, Readercon was the official venue for presentation of the Rhysling Award. It has hosted the Shirley Jackson Awards since their founding in 2007.

<doc id="5954248" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954248" title="Vienna S-Bahn">
Vienna S-Bahn

The Vienna S-Bahn is a suburban metro railway network in Vienna, Austria. As opposed to the city-run urban metro network, the Vienna U-Bahn, it extends beyond the borders of the city, is operated by the Österreichische Bundesbahnen (Austrian federal railways), and consists of many branch lines. "S-Bahn" is short for "Schnellbahn", which can be translated as "rapid railway".
Network.
The Viennese S-Bahn consists of a multitude of branch lines extending beyond the city boundary, most of which converge at a central route segment called the "Stammstrecke" ("trunk line"). While many of the individual lines run at half-hourly or hourly intervals, they are able to offer combined frequencies of only a few minutes or less along the "Stammstrecke". One line, the S45, operates entirely within Vienna's boundaries.
The numbering of the lines have changed since the partial opening of the new Vienna Central Station ("Hauptbahnhof") on 9 December 2012.
No lines except for S45 and S80 always have the same route and final station; most have trains that go further and ones that do not.
History.
Planning for an S-Bahn network for Vienna was started in 1954, as a part of reconstruction of the Austrian Federal Railways. Concrete plans were completed by 1955, but financing was not secured until 1958. The collapse of the investment budget of the ÖBB led to a partial stop of construction in 1960, necessitating a postponing of the grand opening of the network by a little over a year.
The S-Bahn era in Austria began on January 17, 1962. After a day of testing the network with empty trains, passenger transport began at midnight the following day.
From 1962 until 2005, the term "S-Bahn" was rarely used, the full term "Schnellbahn" being preferred. Starting with the 2005/2006 timetable, however, "S-Bahn" has begun to appear in timetables and loudspeaker announcements. Announcements in Wiener Lokalbahn trains still use the Term "Schnellbahn" as of 2009.
The "S-Bahn-Stammstrecke" Wien Meidling – Wien Floridsdorf.
The "Stammstrecke" ("core route") of the Vienna S-Bahn has a length of 13,3 km (8.3 mi). 
From the south to the north, the following stations are served:
All lines stop at all "Stammstrecke" stations except for S5 and S6 which do not stop at Matzleinsdorfer Platz.
The "Wiener Vorortelinie".
The most highly frequented single line in Vienna is the S45 "Wiener Vorortelinie", which translates to "Vienna Suburban Line". The localities along this line all lie within the city proper, although they were independent until the late nineteenth century, when they were annexed, six years before this line opened. Originally part of Otto Wagner's federally operated Stadtbahn, this line was not taken over by the city with the rest of the network in 1925. The line was subsequently closed in 1932. Although still used for freight traffic for several decades afterwards, the line would not see passenger traffic until 1987, when it was reopened as part of the S-Bahn after extensive renovation.
Many of the original Otto Wagner stations are still standing and still in use. However, two of the present stations, Breitensee and Oberdöbling were demolished after the original line's closure and rebuilt in a different style by architects Alois Machatschek and Wilfried Schermann. One new station, "Krottenbachstraße" was added to the refurbished line, and two of the original line's stations, "Baumgarten" and "Unterdöbling", which had also been demolished, were not replaced. Rebuilding "Unterdöbling" station is proposed for the near future, as is extending the line south to the Reichsbrücke. The line was extended from Heiligenstadt to "Handelskai" in 1996, to allow for an easy connection to line "U6" of the Vienna U-Bahn".

Washington Huskies football

College football has a long history at the University of Washington. The Washington Huskies have won 15 Pacific-10 Conference championships, seven Rose Bowl titles, and four national championships recognized by the NCAA. Washington's all-time record of 679-423-50 ranks 19th by all-time winning percentage and 22nd by all-time victories. The team has two of the nation's longest winning streaks, including an NCAA second-best of 39 wins in a row, holds the Division I-A unbeaten record at 63 consecutive games, and has had a total of twelve unbeaten seasons, including seven perfect seasons. Washington is one of four charter members of what became the Pacific-12 Conference and one of only two schools with uninterrupted membership from the beginning. From 1977 through 2003, Washington had 27 consecutive non-losing seasons—the most of any team in the Pac-12 and the 14th longest streak by an NCAA Division I-A team. Through the 2011 season, its 357 conference victories rank second in conference history. The Huskies play on campus in historic Husky Stadium and are currently coached by Chris Petersen.
Washington is often referred to as one of the top Quarterback U's due to the long history of quarterbacks playing in the National Football League (NFL), including the second-most QB starts in NFL history. All but two of the last 19 starting quarterbacks dating back to 1970 have gone on to the NFL, the most recent being Jake Locker, drafted eighth overall by the Tennessee Titans in the 2011 NFL Draft.
History.
Origins.
Football started at the University of Washington in 1889 under President Thomas Milton Gatch, two years before the school campus in downtown Seattle, Washington was relocated to its current location in the University District. The team's first game was played on November 28, 1889 in Seattle, resulting in a 0-20 defeat to the Eastern College Alumni before a crowd of 400 spectators. This represented the first collegiate football game in the Pacific Northwest.
Conference history.
Washington played its first 26 seasons of college football from 1889 to 1915 as an independent. In 1916, Washington and three others joined to create the Pacific Coast Conference which evolved into the modern day Pacific-12 Conference. Membership includes the PCC (1916-1958), Athletic Association of Western Universities or AAWU (1959-1968), Pacific-8 (1969-1978), Pacific-10 (1979-2010), Pacific-12 (2011-Present). The Pac-12 Conference claims the history of each of these preceding conferences as its own. Washington and Cal are the only founding and continuous members in each of these successive conferences.
Head coaching history.
Early history (1889–1907).
Ten different men served as Washington head coaches during the first 18 seasons. While still an independent, the team progressed from playing 1 to 2 games per season to 10 matches per season as the sport grew in popularity. The school initially used a variety of locations for its home field. Home attendance grew from a few hundred to a few thousand per home game, with on-campus Denny Field becoming home from 1895 onward. The 1900 team played in-state rival Washington State College to a 5–5 tie, in the first game in the annual contest later known as the Apple Cup.
Gil Dobie era (1908–1916).
Gil Dobie left North Dakota Agricultural and became Washington's head coach in 1908. Dobie coached for nine remarkable seasons at Washington, posting a 58–0–3 record. Dobie's career comprised virtually all of Washington's NCAA all-time longest 63-game unbeaten streak (outscoring opponents 1930 to 118) and included a 39-game winning streak, second longest in NCAA Division I-A/FBS history. In 1916, Washington and three other schools formed the Pacific Coast Conference, predecessor to the modern Pacific-12 Conference. In Dobie's final season at Washington, his 1916 team won the PCC's inaugural conference championship. Dobie was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 as a charter member.
Hunt-Savage-Allison era (1917–1920).
After the Dobie era came to a close, Washington turned to a succession of coaches with mixed results. Claude J. Hunt (1917, 1919) went a cumulative 6–3–1 highlighted by the school's second PCC championship in 1919, Tony Savage (1918) 1–1, and Stub Allison (1920) 1–5.
The era concluded with the team's move from Denny Field to its permanent home field of Husky Stadium in 1920. Washington athletics adopted the initial nickname of Sun Dodgers in 1919 used until 1922, before becoming the Huskies from 1923 onward.
Enoch Bagshaw era (1921–1929).
Enoch Bagshaw graduated from Washington in 1907 as the school's first five-year letterman in football history. After leading Everett High School from 1909 to 1920, including consecutive national championships in 1919 and 1920, Bagshaw returned to Washington as the first former player turned head coach in 1921, ultimately overseeing the program's second period of sustained success.
Bagshaw's tenure was marked by 63–22–6 record and the school's first two Rose Bowl berths, resulting in a 14–14 tie against Navy in the 1924 Rose Bowl and a 16–19 loss to Alabama in the 1926 Rose Bowl. His 1925 team won the school's third PCC championship. Bagshaw left the program after his 1929 team had a losing season, only the second such season in his tenure. Bagshaw passed away the following year at the age of 46.
James Phelan era (1930–1941).
James Phelan succeeded Bagshaw for the 1930 season. The Notre Dame graduate guided the Huskies to a 65–37–8 record over 12 seasons. His 1936 team won the school's fourth PCC championship, but lost in the 1937 Rose Bowl to Pittsburgh 0–21. Phelan guided the Huskies to their first bowl game victory, beating Hawaii 53–13 in the 1938 Poi Bowl. In later years, he became the first former Husky head coach to also do so in professional football. Phelan was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973.
Welch-Odell-Cherberg-Royal era (1942–1956).
Following Phelan, Washington fielded a succession of teams under four coaches without either great success, or failure. Washington participated in one bowl game and tallied no conference championships during this period with an overall record of 65–68–7.
Ralph Welch played at Purdue under head coach James Phelan, whom he followed to Washington to become an assistant coach in 1930. In 1942, Welch was promoted to succeed Phelan as Washington's head coach and served until 1947, compiling a record of 27–20–3. World War II limited both the 1943 and 1944 seasons of the PCC, reducing team participation from ten team down to just four. Welch's 1943 team accepted the school's third Rose Bowl bid, but lost to PCC champion USC 0–29 in the 1944 Rose Bowl. Welch's first five teams all fielded winning records, but final 1947 team did not.
Howard Odell joined Washington in 1948 from Yale. In his five seasons from 1948 to 1952, he compiled a record of 23–25–2 with two winning seasons..
John Cherberg, a Washington player and then assistant from 1946 to 1952, became head coach in 1953. He compiled a 10–18–2 record from 1953 to 1955, before being removed due to a payoff scandal. Cherberg went on to become Washington state's longest serving Lieutenant Governor, from 1957 until his death in 1989.
Darrell Royal was retained and led the 1956 team to a 5–5 record, before leaving to coach the Texas Longhorns where he won three national championships, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983, and had the Longhorn's stadium renamed in his honor (Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium).
Jim Owens era (1957–1974).
In 1957, Jim Owens came to Washington after stints as an assistant with Paul "Bear" Bryant at Kentucky and Texas A&M. According to legend, after the 1956 season, when the Huskies were looking for a head coach, Bryant indicated to reporters that Owens "will make a great coach for somebody some day." Over 18 seasons, Owens would compile a 99–82–6 record.
After a pair of unremarkable initial seasons, Owens led his 1959, 1960, and 1963 teams to three AAWU championships and associated Rose Bowl berths: a 1960 Rose Bowl 44–8 win over Wisconsin, a 1961 Rose Bowl 17–7 win over Minnesota, and a 7–17 loss to Illinois in the 1964 Rose Bowl. The Helms Athletic Foundation named the 1960 team the national champions, the school's first such title in football.
Owens' later teams would never match this level of success, partly owing to a conference prevention of a second bowl team representative until 1975. Owens concurrently served as the athletic director at Washington from 1960 to 1969. Owens resigned as head coach of the Huskies following the 1974 season, as the Pac-8's third winningest coach of all-time. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1982.
Don James era (1975-1992).
Don James came to Washington from Kent State. During his 18-year tenure, James' Huskies won four Rose Bowls and one Orange Bowl. His 1991 team shared the national championship with Miami. The Huskies won 22 consecutive games from 1990-1992. James' record with the Huskies was 153-57-2. James won national coach of the year honors in 1977, 1984 and 1991 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.
During the 1992 season, it was revealed that several of James' Huskies players received improper benefits, most notably starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert. Although James and his staff were not personally implicated in any NCAA violation, James became upset with the NCAA's sanctions against his team and resigned as head football coach on August 22, 1993.
Jim Lambright era (1993-1998).
Jim Lambright was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach following the sudden and surprising departure of James. Lambright led the Huskies to four bowl appearances in his six seasons. Despite these bowl appearances and a 44-25-1 overall record, Lambright was fired by athletic director Barbara Hedges after a 6-6 1998 season.
Neuheisel-Gilbertson era (1999-2004).
Rick Neuheisel was hired away from Colorado to take over as the Huskies' head football coach. During his tenure, the Huskies went 33-16, highlighted by a victory in the Rose Bowl in January 2001 over Purdue. Purdue's quarterback Drew Brees was out-dueled by Washington's quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo in an exciting game. Neuheisel also led the Huskies to two berths in the Holiday Bowl and to the Sun Bowl during his four-year tenure.
Neuheisel was fired in June 2003 after he admitted to taking part in a calcutta pool for the 2003 Men's NCAA basketball tournament. Neuheisel sued for wrongful termination, ultimately settling the case in March of 2005 for $4.5 million, paid by the NCAA and Washington athletics department.
Keith Gilbertson was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach following Neuheisel's termination. Gilbertson's first season ended with a decent 6-6 record despite no bowl appearance. But a 1-10 season the next season ended in his firing. That 1-10 season is only Washington's second since the end of World War II. In two seasons, Gilbertson's record was 7-16.
Tyrone Willingham era (2005-2008).
Former Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham was hired as the next head football coach of the Washington Huskies. Willingham's Huskies failed to post a winning record in any of Willingham's four seasons, the best being a 5-7 2006 season. Willingham's record at Washington is a dismal 11-37, the worst winning percentage (.229) of any head football coach in Washington Huskies football history. Willingham was fired after a winless 2008 season.
Steve Sarkisian era (2009-2013).
USC offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian was named the 23rd head football coach of the Washington Huskies following the firing of Willingham. Sarkisian, known as an offensive mind and quarterbacks coach, helped develop Jake Locker into an elite college quarterback. Sarkisian never won more than eight games in a single season despite only one losing season. Sarkisian's record at Washington is 34-29. Sarkisian departed after the 2013 season to go back to USC as the head football coach.
Chris Petersen era (2014-present).
On December 6, 2013, it was announced that Washington would hire Chris Petersen away from Boise State as the Huskies head football coach.
Championships.
National championships.
Washington claims 1960 and 1991 national championships, with the NCAA record book additionally recognizing the 1984 and 1990 seasons. Bill Libby selected Washington as the 1910 National Champion.
1960 National champions.
The 1960 team took an improbable road to the Rose Bowl and national championship. After suffering a 1 point setback to Navy in week three, the team reeled off eight straight league wins capped by a triumph over Associated Press #1 Minnesota in the Rose Bowl. Because the final Associated Press and United Press International polls were conducted after the final game of the regular season, Minnesota is the AP and UPI national champion for 1960. The postseason poll conducted by the Helms Athletic Foundation recognizes Washington as national champions.
1984 National champions.
The Huskies opened the 1984 college football season with a 9-0 record which included a 20-11 win at #4 Michigan in Michigan Stadium. While being ranked #1 in the AP poll, the Huskies dropped a 16-7 game to eventual Pac-10 champion USC, which cost Washington a chance at the Rose Bowl. The Huskies instead were invited to play in the Orange Bowl against the #2 Oklahoma Sooners. The game is famous for the Sooner Schooner incident. After Oklahoma kicked a field goal to take a 17-14 lead in the fourth quarter, a penalty was called on the Sooners which nullified the score. The Sooner Schooner driver, who didn’t see the flag, drove the wagon on the field and was immediately flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. The ensuing field goal attempt was blocked and led a momentum shift which saw Washington score two touchdowns in less than a minute en route to a 28-17 victory. Senior Jacque Robinson rushed for 135 yards and was named MVP, the first player in history to be named MVP of both the Orange and Rose Bowls.
In winning, the Huskies became the first team from the Pac-10 to play in and win the Orange Bowl. The Huskies finished the year ranked #2 in the polls, behind the WAC champion (13-0-0), 24-17 victors over the unranked Michigan Wolverines (6-5-0) in the Holiday Bowl. BYU's title was notable for being the only time since the inception of the AP poll that a team was awarded the national title without beating an opponent ranked in the top 25 at the season's end. The Huskies were given the opportunity to play BYU in the Holiday Bowl but chose a larger bowl payout over playing a higher ranked opponent in BYU which carried a 22 game win streak into the bowl season. The B (QPRS), FN, and NCF polls awarded the Huskies the national championship, while the school does not claim it.
1990 National champions.
The Huskies started out the season with two solid wins against San Jose State and Purdue, then welcomed 5th ranked USC and won 31-0. The next week they had a close loss to eventual AP national champion Colorado. After that loss, Washington went on to finish the season averaging over 40 points a game while only giving up 14. Also, during this time Washington would end up beating two more ranked teams on their way to the Rose Bowl. Yet, in the second to last game Washington lost to UCLA. Washington subsequently entered the Rose Bowl with a record of 9-2 looking for a victory over highly ranked Iowa. During the game, the Huskies won in dominating fashion with a final score of 46-34, displaying its trademark defense including a NCAA-best run-defense which allowed 66.8 yards per game.
The AP said that the University of Colorado was the National Champion along with the UPI choosing the only undefeated team Georgia Tech. Washington was ranked #5 in the AP poll, receiving no first place votes. The Rothman/FACT, active from 1968–2006, stated that the Washington Huskies were National Champions for 1990, sharing the honor with Colorado, Georgia Tech, and Miami.
1991 National champions.
The Huskies opened the 1991 season on the road, with a 42-7 victory over the Stanford Cardinal. Following a week off, Washington traveled to Lincoln, Nebraska for a showdown with #9 Nebraska. Trailing 21-9 late in the third quarter, Washington staged a rally, scoring 27 unanswered points to claim a 36-21 victory. The Husky offense, led by junior QB Billy Joe Hobert, gained a total of 618 yards. The 618 yards given up by the Cornhuskers was the most in 35 years. The following week saw the return of QB Mark Brunell, the 1991 Rose Bowl MVP who had suffered a knee injury in the spring, as the Huskies beat Kansas State 56-3, while holding the Wildcats to minus-17 yards on the ground. The Huskies followed with back-to-back shutouts of Arizona and Toledo. California was next and the Huskies traveled to Berkeley to face the #7 Golden Bears. Washington won a wild game that was decided on the final play when Walter Bailey broke up a pass on the goal line to preserve a 24-17 win for the Huskies. Oregon and Arizona State visited Husky Stadium next and each walked away with a loss. The Huskies went on their final road trip of the season, first to USC where they won in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the first time since 1980. Needing a victory to clinch a Rose Bowl berth, Washington rolled to a 58-6 win over Oregon State. The Washington State Cougars came to Seattle for the Apple Cup but were no match for the Huskies, as Washington won 56-21, setting up a showdown with Michigan in the Rose Bowl, held January 1, 1992.
The Husky defense, led by Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy winner Steve Emtman, held Michigan to only 205 total yards, limiting Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard to only one catch. The Husky offense, led by quarterbacks Mark Brunell and Billy Joe Hobert, racked up 404 yards of total offense in leading the Huskies to a 34-14 Rose Bowl victory. Hobert and Emtman shared MVP honors.
The Huskies were voted national champions by the USA Today/CNN Coaches Poll, while the Miami Hurricanes topped the AP Poll. The 1991 team averaged over 41 points per game, only once scoring fewer than 20 points, and held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game, including two shutouts.
Conference championships.
Washington has captured a total of 15 conference championships; this includes 4 PCC, 3 AAWU, 1 Pac-8, and 7 Pac-10 championships, and at least one in every decade except the 1940s. Washington won the inaugural PCC championship in 1916. Washington's 15 championships rank third in league history, behind USC's 38 and UCLA's 17 as of 2013. The conference did not allow participation of a second bowl team beyond the conference champion, until 1975.
Rose Bowl championships.
Washington has been continuously affiliated with the Pacific-12 Conference and its predecessors, which have contractually agreed to send a representative (typically the conference champion) to participate in the Rose Bowl. The Big Ten Conference was similarly contracted following World War II. This pairing made the Rose Bowl the most prestigious Bowl Game available to Pac-12 teams, prior to the BCS era.
Bowl games.
The Washington Huskies have a long history and tradition of playing in the Rose Bowl. The Huskies' 14 Rose Bowl appearances are second only to USC in the Pac-10 and third overall (behind USC with 30 and the Michigan Wolverines with 19). The Huskies' seven victories are also third behind USC (21) and Michigan (8). In addition, Washington is also in an elite group of only seven schools to make back-to-back-to-back appearances in the Rose Bowl, a feat they accomplished in 1990-1992. The other schools are Ohio State, Michigan, and Wisconsin from the Big 10 and California, Stanford and USC from the Pac-10. Washington has won at least one Rose Bowl game in every decade since the 1960s. The Pac-8 did not allow a second bowl team from the conference until 1975.
Memorable games.
1975 Apple Cup.
In the 1975 Apple Cup, Washington State led 27-14 with 3 minutes left in the game. WSU attempted a fourth-and-one conversion at the UW 14-yard line rather than a field goal. The resulting pass was intercepted by Al Burleson and returned 93 yards for a touchdown. After a WSU three-and-out, Warren Moon's tipped pass was caught by Spider Gaines for a 78-yard TD reception and a dramatic 28-27 Washington win. WSU Head Coach Jim Sweeney resigned a week later, leaving with a 26-59-1 record.
1981 Apple Cup.
When 14th-ranked Washington State and 17th-ranked Washington met in the 1981 Apple Cup, it was billed as the biggest game in the series since the 1936 game when the winner traveled to the Rose Bowl. Washington's defense was the best in the league, while the Cougars ranked high in the offenseive categories. The outcome of the UCLA-USC game, which kicked off 40 minutes before the UW-WSU game, also had an impact on the game. The Huskies needed the Trojans to upset UCLA to clear the way for a Rose Bowl bid. With so much at stake, there was plenty of scoreboard watching by the frenzied Husky faithful.
With his team trailing 7-3 late in the second quarter, Husky quarterback Steve Pelluer fired a low pass towards wide-out Paul Skansi. Washington State cornerback Nate Brady looked as if he would smother the ball when Skansi dove over the defender for an amazing catch in the endzone.
Washington State drove the ball 69 yards to open the second half and tie the score at 10. From that point the Huskies- behind the fine play of their offensive line- took control. Ron "Cookie" Jackson capped an 80 yard march by running 23 yards to put the Huskies ahead 17-10. Following a Cougar turnover, All-American kicker Chuck Nelson booted his second field goal of the game to increase the Huskies' lead to 10 points.
The fate of the Cougars was sealed when the score of the USC-UCLA game was announced- the Trojans had engineered an upset. The crowd went wild, Nelson added a field goal with less than three minutes to play, and the Huskies were off to the Rose Bowl.
1990 - 'All I Saw Was Purple'.
Heading into the 1990 season, the winner of the USC-Washington game had gone to the Rose Bowl in 10 of the previous 13 seasons. The 1990 match would substantiate that trend.
Washington's All-Centennial team was feted the night before and introduced at halftime of the game, while two members of the historic team- Hugh McElhenny and Nesby Glasgow- delivered inspirational talks to the team. On a bright, sunny day with the temperature reaching 92 degrees, the crowd of 72,617 eagerly awaited the contest.
They could not have imagined the outcome.
For just the third time in 23 seasons the Huskies shut out USC, handing the Trojans their worst conference defeat in 30 years. "Student Body Right" was held to only 28 rushing yards as the Husky defense dominated the line of scrimmage. Greg Lewis the Doak Walker Award winner as the nation's top running back gained 126 rushing yards and sophomore quarterback Mark Brunell threw for 197 yards as the Huskies rolled to a 24-0 halftime lead.
The Husky defense, led by All-American lineman Steve Emtman, stopped everything the Trojans attempted. The defense would hold USC to 163 total yards and seven first downs for the game. They would record three sacks and put so much pressure on Todd Marinovich that after the game, weary and beaten, he said famously: "I just saw purple. That's all. No numbers, just purple".
1992 - 'A Night To Remember'.
Playing in their first night game since 1985, Washington posted an impressive victory against 12th-ranked Nebraska that might have provided the loudest moment in the stadium's long and boisterous history.
Late in the first quarter, Husky Punter John Werdel pinned Nebraska on its three yard-line. Crowd noise caused the Husker linemen to false start on consecutive plays, only adding to the frenzy of the crowd.
When Nebraska quarterback Mike Grant dropped back to his own endzone to attempt a pass, everyone in the stands watched roverback Tommie Smith blitz Grant from his blindside and drop him for a safety. The deafening roar reverberating off the twin roofs literally had the stadium rocking. An ESPN sideline reporter armed with a noise meter reported that the clamor reached 133.6 decibels (ESPN).
Holding a 9-7 lead, the Husky offense went into quick-strike mode at the close of the second quarter. Speedy running back Napoleon Kaufman ended an 80-yard drive with a 1-yard scoring run. Walter Bailey intercepted Grant after the kickoff, and the Huskies went for the kill. Quarterback Billy Joe Hobert threw a 24-yard scoring pass to a diving Joe Kralik to boost the lead to 23-7. Kicker Travis Hanson then boosted a pair of field goals in the second half to cinch a 29-14 win, and jump the Huskies to number one in the wire service polls the following week.
1994 - The 'Whammy in Miami'.
The 'Whammy in Miami' was a college football game played between the Huskies and the Miami Hurricanes on September 24, 1994 in Miami's Orange Bowl. The game was the first football contest between the two schools, but they did share a piece of football history. During the 1991 season, both teams finished the year with identical 12-0 records and both teams were crowned National Champions. The teams were unable to settle the championship on the field, as both teams were locked into their respective bowl games (Washington in the Rose and Miami in the Orange). As a result, both schools agreed to schedule the other for a series of games.
Entering the game, the University of Miami had an NCAA record home winning streak of 58 games, was ranked 5th in the nation and had a 2-0 record. The Hurricanes had not lost at the Orange Bowl since 1985 and not to a team from outside of Florida since 1984. The Huskies on the other hand were 1-1, following a loss to USC and win over Ohio State. Odds makers placed the Huskies as a 14 point underdog. The Hurricanes appeared to be on their way to another home victory and proving the odds makers right in leading the Huskies 14-3 at halftime. After half-time the Huskies came out firing scoring 22 points in 5 minutes. Key plays included a 75-yard touchdown pass, 34-yard interception return, and a fumble recovery. The Huskies showed no signs of slowing down and dominated the second half on the way to the 38-20 victory. The upset made national headlines, including being the top story on ESPN's "SportsCenter".
The final score was Washington 38, Miami 20.
2001 Apple Cup.
Entering the Apple Cup, Washington State (ranked #9 and a 9-1 record), with a BCS bowl-berth and Pac-10 title on the line. The #16-ranked Huskies upset the Cougars by a score of 26-14, removing WSU from contention.
2002 Apple Cup.
With the game in Pullman, #3 Washington State entered the game poised for BCS National Championship game consideration, behind QB Jason Gesser. Gesser was injured by DT Terry "Tank" Johnson late in the game. The Cougars led 20-10 with less than 4 minutes left in the game, by Matt Kegel replacing Gesser. UW used a timely interception from freshman cornerback Nate Robinson to force Overtime. The teams traded FGs in the first two overtime periods, with John Anderson nailing a 3rd kick to start the third overtime period. In the Cougar's possession, Kegel was ruled by Gordon Riese to have thrown a backward pass which was knocked down and recovered by defensive end Kai Ellis, resulting in a fumble recovered by Washington to end the game. The Martin Stadium crowd erupted with some bottles being thrown by angry players and fans at celebrating players and fans. Then UW athletic director Barbara Hedges said at the time she "feared for her life."
2009 "Miracle on Montlake".
Entering the game, the #3 Trojans had momentum and the national spotlight after their defeat of Ohio State in Columbus the week before. Washington, meanwhile, had just won its first game in 16 contests with a victory over Idaho.
Southern California opened the game with 10 unanswered points, marching down the field at ease. USC was playing without starting quarterback Matt Barkley, who had injured his shoulder the week before at Ohio State, but despite playing with back up QB Aaron Corp, the Trojans were able to lean on an experienced running game and veteran offensive line.
Washington worked its way back into the game with a 4-yard TD run by quarterback Jake Locker, trimming the score to 10-7. Late in the second quarter, placekicker Erik Folk booted a 46-yard field goal to knot the score at 10. The Huskies defense continued to bolster the upset efforts as coordinator Nick Holt's unit plugged up the leaky holes on the line and dared Corp to beat them with his arm.
As the game entered the fourth quarter, the score remained tied. Both teams played cautiously, knowing a mistake would be critical. After swapping field goals, the Huskies took over with four minutes to play. It was this possession where the Huskies not only sealed their comeback, but Jake Locker announced himself to a nationwide audience. The quarterback coolly maneuvered his team down the field, converting on two key third downs, including a 3rd-and-15 from his team's own 28. On that play, Locker slung a throw across the sideline to Jermaine Kearse for 21 yards. The Huskies would eventually drive to the USC 4 before trotting out Folk for the coup de grace.
2009 "Immaculate Interception".
On October 10, 2009 the Huskies hosted the Arizona Wildcats at home. The scoring went back and forth but going into the final 3 minutes the Huskies were down 33-28 when Nick Foles dropped back to pass. The pass deflected off of a sliding Wildcat receiver's foot and into the hands of Junior Linebacker Mason Foster who then returned the interception for a touchdown. The touchdown was upheld after video review. The Huskies would go on to successfully convert a 2-point conversion and hold off the Wildcats one more time for a 36-33 win.
2010 "Deja Vu".
On September 19, 2009 the Washington Huskies knocked off the #3 USC Trojans at home, a win that catapulted them into the top 25. On October 2, 2010 the University of Washington Huskies were riding into the Grand Ol' Lady to face the #18 ranked USC Trojans, a place where they hadn't won since 1996 and also enduring a 13-game road losing streak. They hadn't won on the road since November 3, 2007 against Stanford. The Huskies had the lead for parts of all 4 quarters but never put the game away, including a play in which Jake Locker had the ball stripped out of the end-zone on what was a sure touchdown run. A week prior, Locker was 4-20 against a stifling Nebraska team, he completed 24 of 40 pass attempts for over 300 yards and also ran for 111 yards. Locker did leave the game for 1 play after a knee to helmet hit on a quarterback sneak. Keith Price, a redshirt freshman from Compton, California came in and promptly completed a touchdown pass putting the Huskies ahead 29-28. On the following possession the Trojans hit a field goal to take a 31-29 lead. The Huskies were unsuccessful on the ensuing drive and the Trojans took the ball down the field and with 2+ minutes left, missing a field goal off the right goal post. The Huskies final drive started with two incomplete passes and a near fumble, but on a fourth and 11 Jake Locker completed a pass to a leaping DeAndre Goodwin. The Huskies continued to push the ball down the field into field goal range in a similar situation to the previous year. With 3 seconds left, Erik Folk was kicking with the stage set for a dramatic Husky victory. Trojans coach Lane Kiffin called 2 timeouts, though his attempted icing failed and Erik Folk nailed the game-winning field goal as time expired and the Huskies won their first road game in three years.
Logos and uniforms.
For most of their history, the Huskies have worn gold helmets with a purple block "W" on both sides. However, during Jim Lambright's tenure, the Huskies wore purple helmets with a gold "W."
During Jim Owens' tenure, he would award an outstanding defensive player the honor of wearing a purple helmet during the game. Rick Redman, an All-American linebacker in the 1960s, wore one. It was rather intimidating for the opposing quarterback to stand behind his center and see this lone purple-helmeted player staring him down before each play.
In 2004, the Huskies switched to a new style of uniforms that were worn up until the 2009 season.
In 2009, the Huskies' uniforms were changed to a new style. For the 2010 season, the Huskies' home jersey was altered to match the style of their away jerseys.
On November 18, 2010, in a home game (Senior Game) against UCLA, the Huskies used a "black out" theme, wearing all-black jerseys and pants while encouraging the entire crowd to dress in all-black as well. On the road for the Apple Cup, the Huskies wore the black pants with their normal white jersey. Again for the Holiday Bowl on December 30, 2010 the Huskies wore all black jerseys and pants.
On September 28, 2013, the Huskies debuted their metallic gold helmets. The helmets had the same design as the traditional "W" but with a metallic shined finish. They wore these helmets with purple tops and bottoms in a rain soaked match against the Arizona Wildcats. 
On October 12, 2013 the first ever appearance of College Gameday also saw the Huskies debut matte black helmets. The helmets featured a purple "W" and two purple and gold stripes.

Facilities.
Husky Stadium.
Husky Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Washington Husky football team. Located on the university's campus in Seattle, WA and set next to Lake Washington, it is the largest stadium in the Pacific Northwest with a seating capacity of 72,500. Washington has led the modern Pac-10 Conference in game attendance 13 times, including nine consecutive seasons from 1989 to 1997.
With nearly 70 percent of the seats located between the end zones, covered by cantilevered metal roofs, Husky Stadium is one of the loudest stadiums in the country and is the loudest recorded stadium in college football. During the 1992 night game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, ESPN measured the noise level at 135 decibels, the loudest mark in NCAA history.
In 1968 the Huskies became the first major collegiate team to install an Astroturf field, following the lead of the Astrodome.
Again, prior to the 2000 season, the school was among the leaders adopting FieldTurf, trailing only Memorial Stadium's installation by one season.
Renovation of Washington's Husky Stadium began on November 7, 2011 and its games will be moved to CenturyLink Field until the construction is completed in 2013.
The Huskies opened their $280 million renovated stadium on Saturday, August 1, 2013, they won a thrilling match 38-6 against the Boise State Broncos to welcome back their fans to "the most scenic landscape in college football."
Its U-shaped design was specifically oriented (18.167° south of due east) to minimize glare from the early afternoon sun in the athletes' eyes. The open end overlooks scenic Lake Washington and the Cascade Mountains, including Mount Rainier. Prior to the 2011-13 renovation, its total capacity of 72,500 made it the largest stadium in the Pacific Northwest and the 23rd largest in college football.
Dempsey Indoor.
The Dempsey Indoor is an facility opened in September 2001. The building is used as an indoor practice facility for Washington's football, softball, baseball and men's and women's soccer teams.

Mock modular form

In mathematics, a mock modular form is the holomorphic part of a harmonic weak Maass form, and 
a mock theta function is essentially a mock modular form of weight 1/2. The first examples of mock theta functions were described by Srinivasa Ramanujan in his last 1920 letter to G. H. Hardy and in his lost notebook. discovered that adding certain non-holomorphic functions to them turns them into harmonic weak Maass forms.
History.
Ramanujan's 12 January 1920 letter to Hardy, reprinted in , listed 17 examples of functions that he called mock theta functions, and his lost notebook contained several more examples. (Ramanujan used the term "theta function" for what today would be called a modular form.) Ramanujan pointed out that they have an asymptotic expansion at the cusps, similar to that of modular forms of weight 1/2, possibly with poles at cusps, but cannot be expressed in terms of "ordinary" theta functions. He called functions with similar properties "mock theta functions". Zwegers later discovered the connection of the mock theta function with weak Maass forms.
Ramanujan associated an order to his mock theta functions, which was not clearly defined. Before the work of Zwegers, the orders of known mock theta functions included
Ramanujan's notion of order later turned out to correspond to the conductor of the Nebentypus character of the weight harmonic Maass forms which admit Ramanujan's mock theta functions as their holomorphic projections.
In the next few decades, Ramanujan's mock theta functions were studied by Watson, Andrews, Selberg, Hickerson, Choi, McIntosh, and others, who proved Ramanujan's statements about them and found several more examples and identities. (Most of the "new" identities and examples were already known to Ramanujan and reappeared in his lost notebook.) found that under the action of elements of the modular group, the order 3 mock theta functions almost transform like modular forms of weight 1/2 (multiplied by suitable powers of "q"), except that there are "error terms" in the functional equations, usually given as explicit integrals. However for many years there was no good definition of a mock theta function. This changed in 2001 when Zwegers discovered the relation with non-holomorphic modular forms, Lerch sums, and indefinite theta series. showed, using the previous work of Watson and Andrews, that the mock theta functions of orders 3, 5, and 7 can be written as the sum of a weak Maass form of weight and a function that is bounded along geodesics ending at cusps. The weak Maass form has eigenvalue 3/16 under the hyperbolic Laplacian (the same value as holomorphic modular forms of weight ); however, it increases exponentially fast near cusps, so it does not satisfy the usual growth condition for Maass wave forms. Zwegers proved this result in three different ways, by relating the mock theta functions to Hecke's theta functions of indefinite lattices of dimension 2, and to Appell–Lerch sums, and to meromorphic Jacobi forms.
Zwegers's fundamental result shows that mock theta functions are the "holomorphic parts" of real analytic modular forms of weight 1/2. This allows one to extend many results about modular forms to mock theta functions. In particular, like modular forms, mock theta functions all lie in certain explicit finite-dimensional spaces, which reduces the long and hard proofs of many identities between them to routine linear algebra. For the first time it became possible to produce infinite numbers of examples of mock theta functions; before this work there were only about 50 examples known (most of which were first found by Ramanujan). As further applications of Zwegers's ideas, Kathrin Bringmann and Ken Ono showed that certain q-series arising from the Rogers–Fine basic hypergeometric series are related to holomorphic parts of weight 3/2 harmonic weak Maass forms and showed that the asymptotic series for coefficients of the order 3 mock theta function "f"("q") studied by and converges to the coefficients . In particular Mock theta functions have asymptotic expansions at cusps of the modular group, acting on the upper half-plane, that resemble those of modular forms of weight 1/2 with poles at the cusps.
Definition.
A mock modular form will be defined as the "holomorphic part" of a harmonic weak Maass form.
Fix a weight "k", usually with 2"k" integral. 
Fix a subgroup Γ of SL2("Z") (or of the metaplectic group if "k" is half-integral) and a character ρ of Γ. A modular form "f" for this character and this group Γ transforms under elements of Γ by
A weak Maass form of weight "k" is a continuous function on the upper half plane that transforms like a modular form of weight 2 − "k" and is an eigenfunction of the weight "k" Laplacian operator, and is called harmonic if its eigenvalue is (1 − "k"/2)"k"/2 . This is the eigenvalue of holomorphic weight "k" modular forms, so these are all examples of harmonic weak Maass forms. (A Maass form is a weak Maass form that decreases rapidly at cusps.)
So a harmonic weak Maass form is annihilated by the differential operator
If "F" is any harmonic weak Maass form then the function "g" given by
is holomorphic and transforms like a modular form of weight "k", though it may not be holomorphic at cusps. If we can find any other function "g"* with the same image "g", then "F" − "g"* will be holomorphic. Such a function is given by inverting the differential operator by integration; for example we can define
where 
is essentially the incomplete gamma function.
The integral converges whenever "g" has a zero at the cusp "i"∞, and the incomplete gamma function can be extended by analytic continuation, so this formula can be used to define the holomorphic part "g"* of "F" even in the case when "g" is meromorphic at "i"∞, though this requires some care if "k" is 1 or not integral or if "n" = 0. The inverse of the differential operator is far from unique as we can add any homomorphic function to "g"* without affecting its image, and as a result the function "g"* need not be invariant under the group Γ. The function "h" = "F" − "g"* is called the holomorphic part of "F".
A mock modular form is defined to be the holomorphic part "h" of some harmonic weak Maass form "F". So there is an isomorphism from the space of mock modular forms "h" to a subspace of the harmonic weak Maass forms.
The mock modular form "h" is holomorphic but not quite modular, while "h" + "g"* is modular but not quite holomorphic. The space of mock modular forms of weight "k" contains the space of nearly modular forms ("modular forms that may be meromorphic at cusps") of weight "k" as a subspace. The quotient is (antilinearly) isomorphic to the space of holomorphic modular forms of weight 2 − "k". The weight-(2 − "k") modular form "g" corresponding to a mock modular form "h" is called its shadow. It is quite common for different mock theta functions to have the same shadow. For example, the 10 mock theta functions of order 5 found by Ramanujan fall into two groups of 5, where all the functions in each group have the same shadow (up to multiplication by a constant).
a theta series of the form
for a positive rational κ and an odd periodic function "ε". (Any such theta series is a modular form of weight 3/2). The rational power of "q" is a historical accident.
Most mock modular forms and weak Maass forms have rapid growth at cusps. It is common to impose the condition that they grow at most exponentially fast at cusps (which for mock modular forms means they are "meromorphic" at cusps). The space of mock modular forms (of given weight and group) whose growth is bounded by some fixed exponential function at cusps is finite-dimensional.
Appell–Lerch sums.
Appell–Lerch sums were first studied by and . Watson studied the order 3 mock theta functions by expressing them in terms of Appell–Lerch sums, and Zwegers used them to show that mock theta functions are essentially mock modular forms.
The Appell–Lerch series is
where 
and
The modified series
where 
and "y" = Im(τ) and
satisfies the following transformation properties
In other words the modified Appell–Lerch series transforms like a modular form with respect to τ. Since mock theta functions can be expressed in terms of Appell–Lerch series this means that mock theta functions transform like modular forms if they have a certain non-analytic series added to them.
Examples.
Mock theta functions are mock modular forms of weight 1/2 whose shadow is a unary theta function, multiplied by a rational power of "q" (for historical reasons). Before the work of Zwegers led to a general method for constructing them, most examples were given as basic hypergeometric functions, but this is largely a historical accident, and most mock theta functions have no known simple expression in terms of such functions.
The "trivial" mock theta functions are the (holomorphic) modular forms of weight 1/2, which were classified by , who showed that they could all be written in terms of theta functions of 1-dimensional lattices.
The following examples use the q-Pochhammer symbols formula_18 which are defined as:
Order 2.
Some order 2 mock theta functions were studied by .
The function μ was found by Ramanujan in his lost notebook.
These are related to the functions listed in the section on order 8 functions by
Order 3.
Ramanujan mentioned four order-3 mock theta functions in his letter to Hardy, and listed a further three in his lost notebook, which were rediscovered by G. N. Watson. proved the relations between them stated by Ramanujan and also found their transformations under elements of the modular group by expressing them as Appel–Lerch sums. described the asymptotic expansion of their coefficients. related them to harmonic weak Maass forms. See also 
The seven order-3 mock theta functions given by Ramanujan are
The first four of these form a group with the same shadow (up to a constant), and so do the last three. More precisely, the functions satisfy the following relations (found by Ramanujan and proved by Watson):
Order 5.
Ramanujan wrote down ten mock theta functions of order 5 in his 1920 letter to Hardy, and stated some relations between them that were proved by . In his lost notebook he stated some further identities relating these functions, equivalent to the mock theta conjectures , that were proved by . found representations of many of these functions as the quotient of an indefinite theta series by modular forms of weight 1/2.
Order 6.
the remaining five sixth-order mock theta functions in terms of φ and ψ. discovered two more sixth order functions.
The order 6 mock theta functions are:
Order 7.
Ramanujan gave three mock theta functions of order 7 in his 1920 letter to Hardy. They were studied by , who found asymptotic expansion for their coefficients, and in . found representations of many of these functions as the quotients of indefinite theta series by modular forms of weight 1/2. described their modular transformation properties. 
These three mock theta functions have different shadows, so unlike the case of Ramanujan's order 3 and order 5 functions, there are no linear relations between them and ordinary modular forms.
The corresponding weak Maass forms are
where
and
is more or less the complementary error function.
Under the metaplectic group, these three functions transform according to a certain 3-dimensional representation of the metaplectic group as follows
In other words, they are the components of a level 1 vector-valued harmonic weak Maass form of weight 1/2.
Order 8.
The two functions "V"1 and "U"0 were found earlier by in his lost notebook.

Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton

Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton () is an 11 acre (4.45 hectare) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Bristol, England, on the north bank of a lower, tidal stretch of the River Avon, 1.9 miles (3 kilometres) downstream from the Avon Gorge, and just east of the village of Shirehampton. It was notified as an SSSI in 1999.
Site Description.
The site consists of a wooded cliff and a narrow salt marsh. The underlying rocks are Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate.
Biological Interest.
Wooded cliff.
The site's principal interest and the reason for its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree ("Sorbus domestica") growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of "Sorbus" here are the whitebeams "Sorbus eminens" and "Sorbus anglica", both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime ("Tilia platyphyllos") also occurs, and herbs include Field Garlic ("Allium oleraceum") and Pale St. John's-wort ("Hypericum montanum").
Saltmarsh plants.
The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies at the base of the cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster ("Aster tripolium") and English Scurvygrass ("Cochlearia anglica"). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well - Slender Hare's-ear ("Bupleurum tenuissimum") and Long-stalked Orache ("Atriplex longipes").

SAS Commuter destinations

The following is a list of destinations served by SAS Commuter as it became integrated into Scandinavian Airlines Denmark, Scandinavian Airlines Sweden and SAS Braathens. Routes in Norway were served by Westlink, in Sweden by Swelink and the rest by Eurolink. Eurolink also served some destinations in Norway and Sweden.

SAS Commuter

SAS Commuter, later branded Scandinavian Commuter was a regional airline created by Scandinavian Airlines parent companies Det Norske Luftfartsselskap, Det Danske Luftfartsselskab and Aerotransport on December 1, 1988. It was merged with the new airlines Scandinavian Airlines Denmark, Scandinavian Airlines Sweden and SAS Braathens in 2004. Its head office was in Kastrup, Tårnby Municipality, Denmark.
The airline operated under four brand names
Though the operations of Westlink are merged with SAS Braathens, the SAS Group has said they want to merge the Norwegian regional operations with Widerøe.
History.
SAS Commuter was started by the owners of SAS to have a separate company to operate regional services. The airline acquired at them most 22 Fokker 50. The aircraft had 50 seats in Norway and 46 in Denmark. Swelink also operated six Saab 2000 aircraft from Stockholm Arlanda.
Eurolink started in 1988 and served domestic and short-haul international destinations from Copenhagen Airport.
Norlink stated operations in Northern Norway in 1990, at first with 7 Fokker 50, reduced to 5 in 1993. The first few years Norlink had major problems with regularity, until it opened a technical base at Trondheim Airport, Værnes in 1995. Following the SAS takeover of Braathens in 2002 Norlink division was moved from Tromsø to Bergen and renamed Westlink. After 1986 when Braathens had sold its last Fokker F-27 turboprops, the airline had wet-leased operations on the routes between Kristiansund - Stavanger - Haugesund - Bergen - Molde - Kristiansund - Trondheim, at first from its subsidiary Busy Bee and from 1993 from the independent operator Norwegian Air Shuttle. After the take-over SAS wanted to operate the routes themselves, and moved six Fokker 50 aircraft from Tromsø to Bergen. At the same time the operations previously operated by Norlink were taken over by SAS subsidiary Widerøe who operate public service obligation (PSO) routes in Northern Norway. Widerøe has operated the old Norlink routes with Dash-8-300 aircraft.
Starting in 2000 the airline replaced its fleet of aircraft in Sweden and Denmark with 24 brand new Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft seating 72 or 58 people. The company kept its Fokker aircraft in Norway, where it still operates six. As part of a company reorganisation in 2001 SAS Commuter became a subsidiary of SAS Group. 
In September 2004 the group reorganised and the operations were transferred to the national operation companies, Scandinavian Airlines Denmark, Scandinavian Airlines Sweden and SAS Braathens in Norway.

George Herbert Jones Laboratory

The George Herbert Jones Laboratory, at 5747 S. Ellis Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, is a facility building of the University of Chicago. Room 405 of the building was named a National Historic Landmark in May 1967.
The Jones Laboratory was built in 1928-1929 as facility and instructional space for the university's staff of research chemists and graduate students in chemistry. 
As part of the U.S. War Department's Manhattan Project, University of Chicago chemists began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element, plutonium. Room 405 was the site where, for the first time, a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured in September 1942. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight.
Physicist Glenn Seaborg said of this event: "These memorable days will go down in scientific history to mark the first sight of a synthetic element, and the first isolation of a weighable amount of an artificially produced isotope of any element."
The U.S. Department of Energy remediated Jones Laboratory in the 1980s by studying and removing almost all of the building's World War II-era radioactive waste. The remediation took place in 1982, 1983, and 1987. 
Although room 405 looks nothing like the original condition, the lobby of the laboratory maintains a collection of the specialized equipment used to perform the measurements.

Estadio Eduardo Santos

Estadio Eduardo Santos is a multi-use stadium in Santa Marta, Colombia, used mostly for football matches. It is the largest sports facility in Magdalena Department with a maximum capacity of 23,000 people. The stadium is named after politician and publisher Eduardo Santos, President of the Republic of Colombia from 1938 to 1942. 
Unión Magdalena.
Since its opening in 1951, Estadio Eduardo Santos has been home to the football club Unión Magdalena, and witnessed the birth of prominent figures of Colombian football, including former captain Colombia Carlos 'El pibe' ('The Kid') Valderrama. In 2002, a monumental sulpture of Carlos Valderrama was unveiled at the stadium entrance in a grand ceremony with fireworks attended by about 14,000 people, including 3,000 special guests. The 6.5 meter high, eight ton monument sculpted by Amilkar Ariza, is considered the world's largest bronze for a footballer. It has become the most visited sculpture in Santa Marta.
In 1968, with a final game against Deportivo Cali played in the Eduardo Santos Stadium, Union Magdalena won it’s first and only Colombian Football League Championship to date. During the celebration a motor vehicle accident took the life of a fan in the caravan of triumph, and it is said that Magdalena can never again rise to champion due to the ""Curse of the Celebration."”
Renovations.
1998 - With an investment of 340 million pesos, the capacity of the stadium's South Stand was increased by 3,700 spectators.
2008 - A government initiative to restructure the system was launched in response to poor stadium conditions that had resulted from years of neglect. 
2013 - On March 3rd, the Unión Magdalena played their last game in the stadium against Llaneros FC, in compliance with the order to permanently close the Eduardo Santos due to precarious safety conditions for those attending. Plans were announced for an investment of 20,000 million pesos in a new stadium Eduardo Santos on the same site, with input from the National Government.
2014 - Plans are in progress to construct the new football stadium in time for the Bolivarian Games 2017. The new stadium is to be relocated to the Villa Deportiva Bolivariana. A center for indoor sports such as gymnastics, boxing, and weightlifting is to be built at the current site of Estadio Eduardo Santos, which will be demolished due to deterioration of its physical infrastructure.

Służba Zwycięstwu Polski ("Service for Poland's Victory", or "Polish Victory Service", abbreviated SZP) was the first Polish resistance movement in World War II. It was created by the order of general Juliusz Rómmel on 27 September 1939, when the siege of Warsaw, capital of Poland, where Rómmel commanded Polish defence, was nearing its end (Warsaw would capitulate on 28 September).
The commander of SZP was General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski. This secret organisation was tasked with the continuing of armed struggle to liberate Poland in the pre-war borders of the Second Polish Republic, recreation and reorganization of the Polish army and establishment of the secret government (Polish Underground State).
In November 1939 SZP was renamed Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ).

Conqueror-class monitor

The "Conqueror" class battleships were ironclad warships which served in the Victorian Royal Navy, and whose main weapon was designed to be the ram.
Description.
The class consisted of two ships, and . At the time of their inception and design, it appeared to naval architects that armour plate could be made resistant enough to protect the essential areas of warships from incoming artillery fire, and that therefore an alternative method of offence was needed in order to achieve a decisive outcome in any future naval combat. The answer appeared to be to use the whole ship as a projectile with which to ram an enemy. 
These ships were of only moderate size, and were intended to be adequately fast, and manoevrable enough to be able to catch and strike a fleeing or manoeuvering enemy. They carried a single turret carrying two large guns, which were intended to engage on either beam an enemy who had evaded a ramming attack. Firing over the bow was expected to cause unacceptable structural damage from blast. 
The ships were not seen as successful, as they were too small for efficient service as ocean-going vessels, and too large to function close inshore as coast- or harbour-defence ships. They only had some nine feet of freeboard forward, and could not make more than ten knots in rough weather. They also rolled excessively. Neither ship ever saw any front-line deployment, spending their entire lives as gunnery tenders or in reserve.

After the death of his mother, Nasri was raised in the care of his elder sister Helena. He worked as a shoemaker in his teens and worked for the government for three months. At Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV's direction, Nasri joined the theological school in the name of the forty martyrs.
Ordination.
In 1887, he joined Deir al-Za`faran and was ordained deacon in 1887 by Patriarch Peter IV. He became a sharwoyo (novitiate) in 1888 and a monk in 1889 upon which he took the name Elias. 
Elias was ordained qashisho (priest; lit. presbyter) in 1892 by Patriarch Peter IV. In the waning years of the 19th century, numerous Armenian and Syriac Christians were massacred in Turkey. Qashisho Elias endeared himself to the Armenian Christians providing refuge for about 7000 in the monastery of Mor Quryaqos. He was later appointed the reesh dayroyo of the Mor Quryaqos as well as Deir al-Za`faran. In 1908 Qashisho Elias was consecrated bishop of Amid (Diyarbakr) by Patriarch Ignatius Abded Aloho II with the name Mor Iwanius. 
In 1912, he was transferred to Mosul where he served until his elevation to the patriarchate in 1917. After Patriarch `Abded Aloho died November 26, 1915, Mor Iwanius was elected Patriarch and assumed the throne in 1917. The firman (decree) was issued by the Ottoman sultan Muhammad Rashid, who Patriarch Elias III visited in 1919 at Istanbul; the sultan conferred the Ismania medal on the Patriarch during the visit. In 1922, when civil war broke out in Turkey and Gazi Mustafa Keman Pasha assumed leadership of the newly formed democracy, Mor Elias III spent a few months in Jerusalem. He established a printing press there and began publication of journals in Syriac and Arabic.
Seat of Patriarcate.
Mor Elias III was the last Patriarch to reign at the Kurkmo Dayro (Deir Za`faran) in Mardin, the seat of the Patriarchate for most of the second millennium. Following the massacre of the Syriac Christians in South East Turkey in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire and during World War I, the Patriarch was forced to leave Mardin. In the aftermath of the saypho massacres, Mor Elias III undertook pastoral tours in the Middle East, the first in 1919 and the second in 1925 to Aleppo and Jerusalem. Mor Elias III held a synod Dayro d-Mor Matay in 1930.
Visit to the church in India.
Lord Irwin, then British Viceroy to India, wrote to the Patriarch on December 1, 1930 requesting his intervention in person or through a delegate in resolving the schism that had erupted in the Malankara Church. He responded to the Viceroy's letter accepting his invitation with certain conditions on December 15, 1930. Given his cardiac problems, his doctors attempted to dissuade him from the trip in vain. His 75 year old sister also could not persuade the Patriarch; His Holiness said to her, "Death is inevitable whether here or in India; I would rather sacrifice my life for the sake of our children in Malankara." 
Mor Elias III left Mosul on February 6, 1931 accompanied by Mor Clemis Yuhanon Abbachi, Rabban Quryaqos (later Mor Ostathios Quryaqos), and Rabban Yeshu` Samuel (later Mor Athanasius Samuel of North America), his secretary Zkaryo Shakir (his brother Joseph's son) and translator Elias Ghaduri. They set sail to India on February 28, 1931 from Basra on the ship "Warsova" and disembarked at the Port of Karachi on March 5, 1931. They were received at Karachi by the Patriarchal Delegate Mor Yulius Elias Qoro, Mor Athanasius Paulos of Aluva and several clergymen and faithful. On March 6, 1931, the Patriarch and his entourage proceeded to Delhi by train reaching there on the 8th and visited Lord Irwin. On March 14, the Patriarch arrived at Madras and stayed as a guest of the British Governor Sir George Staly. From there, he arrived at the Thrikkunnathu Seminary in Aluva on March 21, and offered the divine liturgy there on March 22.
H.H. Mor Elias III convened conciliatory meetings at Aluva, Karingachira, Panampady and Kuruppumpady. The Patriarch lead the passion week services at Karingachira. A church delegates meeting was held at Kuruppumpady on July 5, 1931. The denho (Epiphany) services in January 1932 were at the church in Pakkil.
Death.
On February 11, 1932, at the invitation of Qashisho Kuriakos Elavinamannil, the Patriarch arrived at the Manjinikkara Mor Stephanos church from Kallissery. The inability to bring about reconciliation in the church had weighed down heavily on the Patriarch; moreover, the hardships of the long travel had taken its toll on him. On arriving at Manjinikkara, he said, "This place offers us much comfort; we desire to remain here permanently." 
On February 12, he requested the priests who came to visit him not to leave for a couple of days. In the evening, the Patriarch recited many prayers of the qandilo (unction) and contemplated on the departed. On February 13, Mor Clemis Yuhanon Abbachi offered the Holy Qurbono; he gave the sermon during the liturgy. After the noon prayers and lunch, as was his routine, the Patriarch spent time recording events in his journal; he asked for a dictionary to get clarification for the meaning of a word. Following that, he paced about complaining of pain in his head. Soon he fainted and was placed on a cot by the monks where he died at 2:30 pm.
Mor Ignatius Dayro Manjinikkara.
Different opinions arose regarding the final resting place for the Patriarch—a situation that the church in Malankara never had to confront before. The decision was in favor of interring the mortal remains in a plot of land to the north of the Mor Stephanos church, the title deed of which was transferred to the Patriarchate. On February 14, his funeral services was held there. The Mor Ignatios Dayro church was built by the Patriarchal delegate Mor Yulius Elias Qoro over the tomb of the late Patriarch.
The memory of the holy Patriarch is revered throughout the Syriac Orthodox Church and especially in Malankara where thousands of pilgrims reach the tomb by foot on the annual feast day, February 13, from various parts of the Kerala state. Mor Elias III is the only Patriarch of Antioch whose remains are interred in Malankara.
Diptych.
On October 20, 1987, Patriarch Mor Ignatius Zakka I Iwas through encyclical E265/87 permitted the Church in Malankara to remember his name in the fifth diptych.

<doc id="5954493" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954493" title="Mutant Pop Records">
Mutant Pop Records

Mutant Pop Records was an independent record label founded in Corvallis, Oregon in 1995 by Tim "Timbo" Davenport (born October 1, 1961), also known by the "punk name" T. Chandler. The label released approximately 15 full-length albums in compact disc format, and more than 85 releases as 7" vinyl EPs or commercial CD-R discs. The label also re-released several pop-punk-related albums and EPs from other labels that had gone out of print. After ceasing the release of new material in 2002, the label made a brief comeback attempt in 2008 before terminating operations at the end of that year.
Company history.
Mutant Pop Records was a single person operation, a so-called "bedroom label," begun in April 1995.
Timbo has described his own label's history in terms of three eras, focused around three flagship bands. Mutant Pop began with a clear focus on the geeky, sloppy pop punk of The Automatics, followed by the somewhat more complex Connie Dungs, and finished with Ramones-core punks The Peabodys. The label had an estimated 100 releases including vinyl EPs, full length CDs, and several waves of a short-run CD-R mail-order series. Mutant Pop was perhaps the first label to experiment with the CD-R format as a commercial option. 
The label also operated its own wholesale distribution arm, known as 1000 Flowers, which served as an important hub for pop punk distribution during the second half of the 1990s. The distribution began as the wholesale arm of Mutant Pop in 1995, selling directly to record stores. In 1997 it moved to a direct-to-customer mail order service. The monthly mutant pop newsletter through which the distribution catalogue was distributed served as an important tool in the disemmination of knowledge regarding underground pop punk before the widespread use of the internet.
The label went on hiatus in 2001, only releasing a single release before making a small comeback during the first half of 2002. Thereafter the label went to sleep until 2008, when a return to 7" vinyl was made. The economics of the format proved to be untenable, however, and the label was silently terminated at the end of that year.

Text of the historical marker.
German immigrant August Scholz (1825-1891) opened Scholz's Hall at this site in 1866. About the turn of the century, this building replaced the original hall. A German social club, the Austin Saengerrunde, purchased the property in 1908 and added the adjacent hall. The Texas Legislature honored Scholz Garten in 1966 as "a gathering place for Texans of discernment, taste, culture and erudition, epitomizing the finest traditions of magnificent German heritage in our state."

Thomas Elder

Sir Thomas Elder, (5 August 1818 – 6 March 1897) was a Scottish-Australian pastoralist, highly successful businessman, philanthropist, politician, race-horse owner and breeder, and public figure. Amongst "many" other things, he is notable for introducing camels to Australia.
Early years.
Elder was born at Kirkcaldy, Scotland, the fourth son of George Elder, merchant, and his wife Joanna Haddow, "née" Lang.
Thomas' second eldest brother, Alexander Lang Elder (1815–1885), went to South Australia in 1839 and founded the firm of Elder and Company in Adelaide. He was joined by his brothers William (1813–1882)) and George (1816–1897). In August 1851 he was elected a member of the Legislative Council for West Adelaide. He resigned his seat in March 1853, and left South Australia. He settled in London in 1855, and acted as agent for the Adelaide company until 1884, when he and his sons established A. L. Elder & Company. William left Adelaide soon after Alexander. George left in 1855.
South Australia.
Thomas Elder migrated to Adelaide in 1854 and worked with George for a year. After George departed, Thomas formed Elder, Stirling & Co, a partnership with Edward Stirling, Robert Barr Smith and John Taylor. In 1856 Barr Smith married Thomas Elder's sister Joanna, and on Stirling and Taylor's retirement in 1863, Barr Smith and Thomas Elder formed Elder Smith and Co. In 1875, with Andrew Tennant, they formed the Adelaide Steamship Company.
In 1864 he persuaded Arthur Hardy to sell him his Glen Osmond home "Birksgate", which he developed considerably. In 1897 it passed to his nephew T. E. Barr Smith.
Pastoralist.
Elder also had other important interests. He became associated with Peter Waite in the Paratoo run in 1862, in the same year bought Beltana station, and eventually became the owner of an enormous tract of country. Other properties Thomas acquired during this time included Ketchowla Station, Oulnina, Anabama, Tualkilky, Grampus, Ouratan and Netley. He was said to have held at one time a pastoral area greater in extent than the whole of Scotland. Much of this was land with a very low rainfall, and Elder spent a great deal of money sinking artesian wells, making dams and fencing. In January 1866 he introduced camels from India with Afghan attendants, which were of much use in the dry areas and in conveying supplies from Port Augusta. They became an important factor in the development of the northern area of South Australia.
Investor, politician, race horses.
Elder was very fortunate in his mining ventures. Early in the sixties he had large interests in the Moonta and Wallaroo copper-mines which brought him in a huge fortune. He entered political life as a member of the South Australian Legislative Council in 1863 but retired in 1869. He was again elected in 1871, but resigned in 1878 and took no further part in politics. 
Elder was much interested in horses and made the breeding of blood stock a hobby. He was a leading racing man between 1875 and 1884 and had the highest reputation. It was well known that any horse bearing his colours was in the race to win. He sold his race-horses in 1884 but continued his stud.
Philanthropy.
Elder encouraged exploration, contributed largely to Warburton's 1873 expedition and Giles's in 1875, supplying camels in each case, which proved to be of the greatest value. He also contributed liberally to the cost of other explorations, and in no case sought or obtained any return for himself. On one occasion he offered £5,000 on condition that a like sum was subscribed by the public to finance an expedition to the Southern Ocean, but the condition was not fulfilled. 
He supported every kind of manly sport and his benefactions both private and public were widespread and almost without limit. 
The Art Gallery of South Australia received a bequest of £25,000, and many of the finest pictures of the gallery were purchased from this fund. He contributed substantially to the Library's acquisition program. He himself published a small booklet in 1893: "Notes from a Pocket Journal of a Trip up the River Murray in 1856", recounting a voyage in the steamer "Gundagai".
In 1874 he gave £20,000 towards an endowment fund for the newly established University of Adelaide, and on his death in 1897 bequeathed a further £65,000 to the University, £20,000 of which was for a School of Music. The Elder Conservatorium of Music perpetuates his name. Elder's combined gifts and bequests to the University amount to nearly £100,000.
Elder Professor of Mathematics.
One of Elder's bequests established and funded the first professorships at the fledgeling University; the Elder Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; and the Elder Professor of Natural Sciences. The first incumbent, Sir Horace Lamb, an applied mathematician, lectured in pure and applied mathematics as well as giving instruction in practical physics. After Lamb's resignation in 1885 to take up a post at Owens College, Manchester, separate Chairs in Mathematics and Physics were established. The Elder Chair of Mathematics at the University of Adelaide has been held by many eminent mathematicians, including Nobel Prize winner Sir William Henry Bragg. 
Elder Professor of Music.
As well as later funding the Elder Conservatorium, Sir Thomas helped to establish the Elder Professorship of Music in 1883, with the first incumbent taking up the post in 1884. At the same time, Sir Thomas established endowment funds in parallel for the Royal College of Music in London and the Music Board of the University of Adelaide to support the Elder Overseas Scholarship (in Music). 
All of the Elder Professors of Music have also served as Director/Dean of the Elder Conservatorium, providing artistic and academic leadership both in the Conservatorium and in the Faculties/Schools of Music/Performing Arts of which it has been part.
Elder Professor of Anatomy and Histology.
The first two incumbents of this position were known as the Elder Professor of Anatomy. It became the Elder Professor of Anatomy and Histology on the appointment of Professor Herbert Woollard in 1928.
In 1996 the Wood Jones Professor of Biological Anthropological and Comparative Anatomy, named for the second Elder Professor of Anatomy, was established from an endowment by Professor Ray Last (1903-1993), who studied under Wood Jones in the 1920s before embarking on a successful career as a surgeon and teacher in Australia and the United Kingdom. The foundation Wood Jones Chair (1996-) is Professor Maciej Henneberg Ph.D. D.Sc.
Later years.
He had a severe illness in 1887 and shortly afterwards retired. Elder Smith and Company was formed into a public company, and Elder afterwards lived chiefly in the country. He never married. Elder was knighted in 1878 (KCMG) and created Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1887. He died at Mount Lofty on 6 March 1897.

World Bridge Championships

The World Bridge Championships consists of several sets of championships organized under the auspices of the World Bridge Federation.
World Bridge Series Championships.
"World Bridge Series Championships" is the new 2010 name for a quadrennial meet organized by the World Bridge Federation in non-leap even years. Most of its world championship events are open in the sense that entries do not represent geographic zones or nations.
The meet was inaugurated in 1962 as the "World Pair Olympiad" comprising the World Open Pairs Championship and World Women Pairs Championship, as well as the World Mixed Teams Championship. For the second rendition in 1966 the mixed event was for pairs, the World Mixed Pairs Championship, as it would be thereafter except in 1974.
The World Knockout Teams for the Rosenblum Cup was inaugurated in 1978 and soon became the most prestigious event of the meet. A parallel knockout teams for women was added in 1994, for the McConnell Cup. Seniors competition debuted in 1990 with the World Senior Pairs Championship and the World Senior Teams Championship followed in 1994.
The "World Bridge Series" or "World Series" for short comprises championship tournaments for both pairs and teams in open, women's, seniors, and mixed categories. Other events are irregular. All events in the World Bridge Series are open without regard to nationality. Pairs or teams may be transnational and there are no limits on the numbers who enter.
World Bridge Team Championships.
"World Bridge Team Championships" is a new name for the biennial meet organized by the World Bridge Federation in odd years. There are three main events, the World Team Championships for national teams in three flights: Open, Women, and Seniors. Those are commonly called Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup, and d'Orsi Senior Bowl after the trophies awarded to the winners.
Initiated by the British former international player Norman Bach, the Bermuda Bowl was first contested in 1950 in Hamilton, Bermuda; the Venice Cup and the Senior Bowl were integrated as part of the championships in 1974 (in Venice, Italy) and 2000 (in Southampton, Bermuda) respectively. The Senior Bowl, subsequently named the d'Orsi Senior Bowl, has been one of three concurrent World Team Championships throughout its history but the Venice Cup was originally contested less frequently than the Bermuda Bowl and it was once contested alone in a different year (1978). The Bermuda Bowl and Venice Cup have always run concurrently since 1985.
In addition to the foregoing, the World Transnational Open Teams Championship is contested during the late stages of the main events. This competition is open to players of all categories who may form teams without nationality restrictions except that players on the twelve teams that reach the semifinals in the three main flights (ordinarily 72 players) are not eligible.

Kevin Johnson (ventriloquist)

Kevin Johnson (born June 7, 1970) is a ventriloquist, comedian, and magician who, along with his "fine feathered friends" Clyde and Matilda, has entertained many people. Johnson currently performs every Wednesday at the Welk Resorts Theater in Escondido, California. Johnson is married and lives in nearby Temecula with his wife Cherie and their three children.
Biography.
Born in Colorado, Kevin has been a ventriloquist nearly all his life. Kevin started ventriloquism when he was 9 years old, after his parents gave him a pull-string dummy for Christmas. Having no formal training, he taught himself the art of ventriloquism over a 4-year period. He developed his technique from parrots. It intrigued him that parrots could speak so clearly without the use of lips. Kevin later re-learned how to speak all together with the use of his tongue and his throat. Kevin was introduced to the stage by his grandfather Harley Noles, who performed magic shows throughout Colorado. He told Kevin, “If you get good enough, you can open for my show.” At the age of 13, he performed in his grandfather's show with a 5 minute act with a wooden puppet (Raymond), that his grandfather made for him.
During his college days, Johnson taught and entertained youth at a local church where he found a receptive audience for his humor. Upon graduation from college in El Cajon, California, Johnson started performing at the San Diego Zoo in 1994. He then auditioned at Legoland California to pursue his art full-time, and in February 1999, Johnson got the spot and was performing three to four 20-minute shows each day at the Legoland Playtown Theater. Legoland California nominated him for the Big E Awards through IAAPA and won the honor of “Best Male Performer” in 2004 and 2006. Kevin is the only known performer to be recognized twice. IAAPA is the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, and includes attractions from over 90 countries.
Kevin is mostly recognized from his 2006 appearance on NBC’s primetime show "America's Got Talent". He performed his signature "Godzilla Theater" performance, during which his voice and the voices of his puppets are out of synchronization with their mouth movements. He had developed a different version of his performance specifically for the semi-finals, in which he also exchanges voices with his puppets and simulates echos, but didn't get enough audience votes to advance to the finals.
In February 2007, Kevin appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman for the show's second "Ventriloquist Week". Starting in 2008, Johnson has started doing shows on board the Disney Cruise Line ship, "The Disney Magic." These shows last about 45 minutes and feature Clyde and Matilda, along with another puppet that is much more human like, whose name is Harley.
He has recently finished a nine-year run at San Diego’s Legoland California Theme Park where he performed 8,824 shows. He is currently performing during the Summer Nights at Busch Gardens Tampa.Kevin also performs every Tuesday at the Lawrence Welk Resort in Escondido, California, performing a 40 minute show alongside magician Anthony the Magic in a show entitled "The Comedy and Magic Show".
Clyde and Matilda.
In 1983, Johnson was introduced to Clyde the Buzzard in his native state of Colorado, and performed his first "real" show with his grandfather. Nearly 10 years later, in 1991, Kevin was introduced to Matilda the Cockatoo. After adding Matilda to Clyde to become a trio, he would astound audiences with unique and interesting gags and humor

John Deakin

John Deakin (8 May 1912 – 25 May 1972) was an English photographer, best known for his work centered around members of Francis Bacon's Soho inner circle. Bacon based a number of famous paintings on photographs he commissioned from Deakin, including "Portrait of Henrietta Moraes", "Henrietta Moraes on a Bed" and "Three Studies of Lucian Freud". Deakin also spent many years in Paris and Rome, photographing street scenes, but his only stable period of employment as a photographer were two stints of working for "Vogue" between 1947 and 1954. Deakin initially aspired to be a painter, and as his photographic career waned, Deakin devoted his time to painting in the 1960s, questioning the validity and status of photography as an art form. He showed little interest in curating and publicising his own work, so many of his photographs were lost, destroyed or damaged over time.
A chronic alcoholic, Deakin died in obscurity and poverty, but since the 1980s his reputation has grown through monographs, exhibitions and catalogues.
Life and career.
Early life and work for "Vogue".
Deakin was born in Bebington on the Wirral and attended West Kirby Grammar School. Though he had wanted to be a painter, he began to take photographs in Paris in 1939, when fashion illustrator Christian Bérard introduced Deakin to Michel de Brunhoff, editor of French "Vogue". From 1940 until 1945, Deakin served in the British Army Film Unit as a photographer, where he photographed the Second Battle of El Alamein.
After the War, Deakin enjoyed two periods of employment as a staff photographer on the British edition of "Vogue". The first period, from 1947 to 1948, ended in dismissal when he lost several valuable bits of photographic equipment. His second period from 1951 to 1954, and during those three years Deakin was at his most active. He enjoyed the support of "Vogue" editor Audrey Withers, even though he disliked fashion photography. Deakin excelled at portraits of leading figures in literature, theatre and film. His subjects included Dylan Thomas, John Huston, Luchino Visconti and many other artistic celebrities. Deakin recognised this work was his true vocation when he wrote: 
Notorious for "his blistering personality, bad behaviour and total disregard for others", Deakin was fired from "Vogue" for a second time in 1954, on account of his drinking and and "an accumulation of minor incidents involving lateness, a series of crashing tripods, and inevitable arguments with fashion editors." "Vogue" editor Withers ensured he was paid off handsomely. 
Later life and relationship with Francis Bacon.
After being fired by "Vogue" for the second time, Deakin drifted from job to job and he enjoyed a retainer from "The Observer" until 1958. He spent long periods in Rome and in Paris during the 1950s, specialising in street photography. In 1951, John Lehmann published a book of Deakin's Rome photographs, "Rome Alive", with text by Christopher Kinmonth. Deakin spent many years trying unsuccessfully to publish a book of his Paris photographs, but they were exhibited in 1956 in David Archer's bookshop in Soho. The catalogue accompanying the exhibition was written by Elizabeth Smart, a friend of Deakin. Smart's catalogue included the observation: "You certainly won't feel rested after a time in John Deakin's Paris. These pictures take you by the scruff of the neck and insist that you see. If you have never been to Paris, you will find it haunted when you arrive." 
Archer's bookshop, also in 1956, exhibited a second show, 'John Deakin's Rome'. These were the only photo exhibitions Deakin achieved in his lifetime, and they attracted some critical acclaim. In "The Times", Colin MacInnes reviewed the Paris photos: "Mr Deakin sees one side of Alice's looking glass and the infinite mysteries that lie behind it. Art critic David Sylvester wrote : "The pictures of Paris by John Deakin present a vision that is profoundly personal and profoundly strange, a vision which confounds and undermines all notions of where inanimate ends and animate takes over."
Deakin returned to painting in the mid-1950s, but with little success. Daniel Farson commented that "Deakin's artistic career had one consistency: the moment success came near he veered off in another direction." Deakin subsequently abandoned painting for making collages and sclptures in the 1960s.
Deakin, nevertheless, continued to photograph many of the major figures in the Soho art scene during the 1950s and 1960s, including Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach and Eduardo Paolozzi. Though the two had a difficult personal relationship, Bacon held Deakin's work in high regard. After Deakin's death, Bacon described him as "the best portrait photographer since Nadar and Julia Margaret Cameron." Because Bacon "famously preferred photographic reference over live models for his painting", Deakin took many portraits on commission for Bacon, which the artist later used as source material for some of his most famous images. One of the most notable was the "Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorn Standing in a Street in Soho, 1967". Deakin's photos of George Dyer, Muriel Belcher and Henrietta Moraes have also been associated with Bacon's paintings of these sitters. 
In February 2012, Bacon's 1963 "Portrait of Henrietta Moraes", based on Deakin's photo, sold for £21.3 million. Deakin's photo of Lucien Freud supplied one of the sources for Bacon's 1969 painting "Three Studies of Lucian Freud". This work was sold in 2013 for $142 million, making it one of the most expensive paintings ever sold. Deakin's photos of Freud also inspired a series of paintings by Jasper Johns, "Jasper Johns: Regrets", which were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 2014.
Freud and Bacon appeared as two of the "Eight Portraits", an unpublished manuscript of photos and writings which was discovered after Deakin's death. In this work, Deakin wrote of Bacon: "He's an odd one, wonderfully tender and generous by nature, yet with curious streaks of cruelty, especially to friends. I think that in this portrait I managed to catch something of the fear which must underlie these contradictions in his character."
In 1972, Deakin was with diagnosed with lung cancer, and underwent an operation to have it removed. While recuperating, he died of a heart attack while staying in the Old Ship Hotel, Brighton. In hospital, he had named Bacon as his next of kin, forcing the painter to identify the body. "It was the last dirty trick he played on me", Bacon remarked.
Critical opinion and Legacy.
In 1979, the art critic John Russell wrote that, with Deakin's passing, "there was lost a photographer who often rivalled Bacon in his ability to make a likeness in which truth came wrapped and unpackaged. His portraits...had a dead-centred, unrhetorical quality. A complete human being was set before us, without additives." A series of exhibitions revived Deakin's reputation after the obscurity of his final years. In 1984, the Victoria & Albert Museum mounted the exhibition "John Deakin: The Salvage of a Photographer". In 1996, the National Portrait Gallery, London, presented "John Deakin Photographs". An exhibition, "John Deakin: Tattoo Portraits" was staged in Liverpool in 1999.
Daniel Farson wrote of his portraits: "I am sure he will be seen as one of the most disturbing photographers of the century. The expressions of his victims look suitably appalled for Deakin had no time for such niceties as "cheese" and the effect was magnfied by huge contrasty blow-ups with every pore, blemish, and blood-shot eyeball exposed. In this way, he combined the instant horror of a passport photo with a shock value all his own." 
Robin Muir has summed up his legacy: "His portraits still look starkly modern, half a century on. His street photographs are haunting documents too, a singular vision of three great cities. After two major retrospectives in London institutions, the Victoria & Albert Museum (1984) and the National Portrait Gallery (1996), and an entry in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", his place in the pantheon of twentieth century British photographers might be secured." Bruce Bernard wrote, at Deakin's first retrospective, that he he was proud "to have had a part in doing out dear, witty and wayward friend some of the justice he so strenuously denied himself."
Deakin was the basis for the photographer Carl Castering in Colin Wilson's novel "Ritual In The Dark". Deakin was played by actor Karl Johnson in John Maybury's biographical film about Francis Bacon, "".

Goodall Wooten House

The Goodall Wooten House is a historic home built in 1898-1900 in Austin, Texas, USA. It was built by local doctor and benefactor Goodall H. Wooten and his wife Ella and was noted for its Classical Revival architecture and lush gardens. The building has served many purposes since passing out of the Wooten family in 1944, such as a student residence hall, a chemical dependency treatment center, a luxury hotel called "The Mansion at Judges' Hill" and currently, a boutique hotel called "Hotel Ella." The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 3, 1975.
History.
The couple had begun planning the house in 1897, when they were married, and on July 20, 1898 Dr. Wooten and his wife purchased the land where the house would sit from Wooten's father, Dr. Thomas D. Wooten. They lived with Wooten's father while the house was being built and their daughter Lucie was born in her grandfather's home. Construction was completed on January 20, 1900 and the family moved in.
The house has three stories and a basement. The basement had servant sleeping quarters, a game room and storage. The first floor boasted an impressive entry foyer, sitting room, music room, dining room and kitchen. The second floor had four bedrooms, another sitting room, a bathroom and a room for Wooten's extensive gun collection. There was room in the attic for more storage.
In 1910, the house underwent a major renovation and went from a large house to a mansion. The west end of the house was expanded and the lower sitting room was merged into a new library and another bedroom was added. The plain hip roof was replaced and received new dormers. Ella hired Neiman-Marcus to redecorate the interior. It was the first house in Austin the Dallas-based company worked on.
Goodhall Wooten died on January 30, 1942 and Ella became the sole owner of the house. Ella sold the house on June 24, 1944. On October 20, 1953, the property was sold to Christian Faith and Life Community, who operated the house until 1972 as a student residence hall years. The house was referred to as Lads House, Wooten House, Wooten Dormitory and Wooten Hall. The building remained a student residence until 1979 under another operator.
The mansion changed purposes on November 15, 1979 when James and Delois Coker bought it and opened the Chemical Dependency Treatment Center of Austin. It served as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for twenty years, although the name changed to the Faulkner Parkside Lodge of Austin and then the Austin Recovery Center.
Since 2003, the house was used under the name "The Mansion at Judges' Hill," although technically the structure does not sit in the old Judge's Hill neighborhood. In September 2013, it reopened as "Hotel Ella." 
The original address of the house was 700 Magnolia Street. Magnolia Street was renamed 19th Street and then Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The address of the house was reassigned to the cross street Rio Grande (originally called San Bernard) and the current address is listed as 1900 Rio Grande.
Texas Historical Commission Marker Text.
Goodall Harrison Wooten (1869–1942) was born in Paris, Texas, the son of Confederate veteran Dr. Thomas Dudley Wooten and his wife, Henrietta Goodall Wooten. Goodall Harrison Wooten attended the University of Texas, where he earned a Bachelor's and Master's degrees; and Columbia University, where he received a medical degree in 1895. He established a medical practice in Austin, and in 1897, married Ella Newsome (1878–1972). Construction of this house began in 1898 and was completed in January 1900. Designed by Dallas architect Charles O'Connell, it soon became an Austin landmark and was known for the extensive gardens planted by Ella Wooten. Renovations in 1910 changed the simple house into a grand Classical Revival mansion, and it remains one of the premier examples of that style in Austin. Prominent features of Goodall Wooten house include its handsome brick and stonework, wraparound gallery, balustrade, and massive two-story paired columns with ionic capitals. It is typical of the large-scale homes built in this neighborhood at the turn of the century. The house remained in the Wooten family until 1944. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark-1990.

From 1991 to 2001 the train was operated by CityRail then Tranz Metro. In 2001, with the partial sale of Tranz Scenic when Tranz Rail sought to separate its commercial passenger rail operations from its subsidised services, it was transferred to Tranz Scenic.
Service.
The train operates Monday-Friday from Palmerston North to Wellington in the morning, returning in the evening.
Weekend services.
On Sunday 19 June 1994 a weekend service from Palmerston North to Wellington and return started. The power/baggage van, catering car and 50-seat (alcove-style with tables) day car (ex Masterton) made up the consist. It attracted minimal patronage and was withdrawn in 1994.
Future.
Concerns were raised that once the Wellington Metlink metro system was extended north from Paraparaumu to Waikanae, the Capital Connection would lose passengers. In 2010 KiwiRail stated it would consider changes after evaluating what impact the metro system has on the Capital Connection's patronage.
By July 2012 the future of the service seemed to be very uncertain. 
KiwiRail announced it would make a decision on the service in August. The Greater Wellington Regional Council and the Horowhenua District Council have proposed partial funding but need the New Zealand Transport Agency to agree to continue the service. However, NZTA will not fund any rail service which does not decongest a road. In August 2012 Greater Wellington Regional Council and Horizons (Manawatu-Wanganui Regional Council) proposed a business case which was evaluated by NZTA.
In March 2013 Labour MP Iain Lees-Galloway supported the service at a parliamentary committee hearing. 
In April 2013 KiwiRail said to keep the connection open, it would have increase ticket prices by 40 percent, and have at least 61 passengers on board in each direction. But it only increased fares by 10 percent from May.
Rolling stock and motive power.
The service began using standard NZR 56-foot carriages: the first of two power-baggage vans from the Bay Express, a 50-seat Southerner car, a 42-seat Northerner car and a 37-seat Northerner catering car. When the Northerner and Southerner cars were returned to their respective trains and patronage continued to increase a former Masterton commuter car was refurbished to the same standard, with the same 50 alcove-style seats as the Southerner car, but with sheepskin seat covers. Later, a former Endeavour car with luggage space at one end and a former Picton - Greymouth car, both from on the Masterton commuter run, were refurbished for the service. Later still, up to five more Masterton cars, a Northerner car, the second Northerner catering car and the sole InterCity spare buffet car saw service. Before these carriages were replaced, the service was regularly running with a van and eight cars.
British Rail carriages.
On Monday 15 November 1999 a new train entered service, made up of seven (later eight) British Rail Mark 2 cars and the second former Southerner modular 11 kW power and baggage van, with 90 kW generator and larger luggage space made up from the middle and expanded non-handbrake end compartments. The new cars are about three metres longer than the older cars and more spacious inside, with more headroom, full air-conditioning, 60 seats per car (28 in the servery car), and twin power sockets at the foot of each pair of seats. Seating arrangement is both alcove and airline-style, using their British Rail InterCity 72 seats. The train is usually hauled by either a pair of DC class locomotives, or a single DFT class or DX class locomotive.
They have been repainted from Tranz Scenic standard "Cato blue" into Capital Connection livery.

Rabin signature algorithm

In cryptography the Rabin Signature Scheme is a method of Digital signature originally proposed by Michael O. Rabin in 1979. The Rabin Signature Scheme was one of the first digital signature schemes proposed, and it was the first to relate the hardness of forgery directly to the problem of integer factorization. Because of its simplicity and prominent role in early public key cryptography, the Rabin Signature Scheme is covered in most introductory courses on cryptography. The Rabin Signature Scheme is existentially unforgeable in the random oracle model assuming the integer factorization problem is intractable. The Rabin Signature Scheme is also closely related to the Rabin cryptosystem.
Original Algorithm.
The algorithm relies on a collision-resistant hash function formula_1
Modern Terminology.
In modern presentations, the algorithm is often simplified as follows
The hash function "H" is assumed to be a random oracle and the algorithm works as follows
In some treatments, the random pad "U" is eliminated and instead we add two numbers "a" and "b" to the public key with formula_7 and formula_8 where formula_9 denotes the legendre symbol. Then for any "r" modulo "n" exactly one of the four numbers formula_10 will be a square, and the signer chooses that one for his signature.
Security.
If "H" is a random oracle, i.e. its output is truly random in formula_11 then, forging a signature on any message "m" is as hard as
calculating the square root of a random element in formula_11. To see that taking a random square root is as hard as factoring, we first note that any square modulo "n" has four square roots since "n" has two square roots modulo "p" and two square roots modulo "q", and each pair gives a unique square root modulo "n" by the chinese remainder theorem. Now, if we have two different square roots, "x","y" such that formula_13 but formula_14, then this immediately leads to a factorization of "n" since "n" divides formula_15 but it does not divide either factor. Thus taking formula_16 will lead to a nontrivial factorization of "n". Now, there exists an algorithm to take square roots, we pick a random "r" modulo "n" and square it formula_17, then, using the algorithm to take the square root of "R" modulo "n", we will get a new square root formula_18, and with probability half formula_19.

Digital delay generator

A digital delay generator is a piece of electronic test equipment that provides precise delays for triggering, syncing, delaying and gating events. These generators are used in many types of experiments, controls and processes where electronic timing of a single event or multiple events to a common timing reference is needed. The digital delay generator may initiate a sequence of events or be triggered by an event. What differentiates it from ordinary electronic timing is the synchronicity of its outputs to each other and to the initiating event.
Equipment.
The digital delay generator is similar to a pulse generator in function but the timing resolution is much finer and the delay and width jitter much less. 
Some manufacturers, calling their units "digital delay and pulse generators", have added independent amplitude polarity and level control to each of their outputs in addition to both delay and width control. Now each channel provides its own delay, width and amplitude control, with the triggering synchronized to an external source or internal rep rate generator - like a general-purpose pulse generator.
Some delay generators provide precise delays (edges) to trigger devices. Others provides precise delays and widths to also allow a gating function. Some delay generators provide a single channel of timing while others provide multiple channels of timing.
Digital delay generator outputs are typically logic level, but some offer higher voltages to cope with electromagnetic interference environments. For very harsh environments, optical outputs and/or inputs, with fiber optic connectors, are also offered as options by some manufacturers. In general, a delay generator operates in a 50 ohm transmission line environment with the line terminated in its characteristic impedance to minimize reflections and timing ambiguities.
Historically, digital delay generators were single channel devices with delay-only (see DOT reference below). Now, multi-channel units with delay and gate from each channel are the norm. Some allow referencing to other channels and combining the timing of several channels onto one for more complex, multi-triggering applications. Multiple-lasers and detectors can be triggered and gated. (see second reference on "Experimental study of laser ignition of a methane/air mixture by planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH.)" Another example has a channel pumping a laser with a user-selected number of flash lamp pulses. Another channel may be used in Q-switching that laser. A third channel can then be used to trigger and gate a data acquisition or imaging system a distinct time after the laser fires. (see sensorsportal.com reference below)
Pulse selection or pulse picking of a single laser pulse from a stream of laser pulses generated via mode-locking is another useful feature of some delay generators. By using the mode-locked rate as an external clock to the digital delay generator one may adjust a delay and width to select a single pulse and synchronize other events to that single pulse.
Uses.
A delay generator can also be used to delay and gate high speed photodetectors in high speed imaging applications. (see reference on high speed photography below)
Digital delay generators are usually the heart of the timing for larger systems and experiments. Users generally create a GUI, graphical user interface to provide a single control to the entire system or experiment. Digital delay generator manufacturers have added remote programming schemes that facilitate the creation of such GUIs. Industry standards such as GPIB, RS232, USB and ethernet are available from a variety of manufacturers.
Experimental fluid dynamics uses digital delay generators in its investigations of fluid flow. The field of PIV, particle image velocimetry, encompasses several subsets which would use digital delay generators as the main component of its timing where multiple lasers may be triggered. Multiple channels may trigger multiple lasers. One is also able to multiplex the timing of several channels onto one channel in order to trigger or even gate the same device multiple times. A single channel may trigger a laser or gate a camera with its multiple, multiplexed pulses. Another useful setup is to have one channel drive flash lamps a preset number of times, followed by a single Q-switch, followed by a delay and gate for the data acquisition or imaging system.
Negative delay is available with digital delay generators that can select some other channel as a reference . This would be useful for applications where an event must occur in advance of the reference. An example would be to allow for the opening of a shutter prior to the reference.
Multi-trigger digital delay generators.
A new development are digital delay generators that have gating and external triggering, dual or multi-trigger capabilities. The gate allows the user to enable outputs and/or triggers with an electronic signal. Some units have gate or trigger capabilities using a single or separate connectors. Dual or multi-trigger digital delay generators have several input triggers. These triggers can be selectively used to trigger any or all channels.
The multi-trigger versions have programmable logic controller type functionality for incorporating interlocks, latches, dynamic delay adjustment and trigger noise suppression. Triggers are formed by logically combining the various inputs and outputs in And, Or, Xor and Negated forms.
LIDAR applications use digital delay generators. A channel is used to trigger a laser. A second channel is used to provide a delayed gate for the data acquisition system. Gating allows regions of interest to be processed and stored while ignoring the bulk of unwanted data.
Dual-trigger digital delay generators provide two independently triggered digital delay generators in one package. Since benchtop digital delay generators are now multi-channel, it is possible to have two or more input triggers and select the channels which respond to each of the triggers. An interesting concept to provide dual-trigger capability converts an instrument that has separate trigger and gate inputs to allow the gate to operate as a second trigger.
DDG Design.
A key issue in the design of DDGs is to generate triggered delays having crystal-oscillator precision but that are not quantized to the edges of the reference oscillator. There are a number of techniques used in digital delay generation.

Karl E. Weick

Karl Edward Weick (born October 31, 1936 in Warsaw, Indiana) is an American organizational theorist who is noted for introducing the notions of "loose coupling", "mindfulness", and "sensemaking" into organizational studies. He is the Rensis Likert Distinguished University Professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
Education.
Weick earned his bachelor's degree at Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio and his Ph.D. in organizational psychology from Ohio State University in 1962.
Key contributions.
Enactment.
Karl Weick uses this term to denote the idea that certain phenomena (such as organizations) are created by being talked about.
"Managers construct, rearrange, single out, and demolish many 'objective' features of their surroundings. When people act they unrandomize variables, insert vestiges of orderliness, and literally create their own constraints." Psychology of Organizing, p243
Loose coupling.
Karl Weick's major contribution to the topic of loose coupling in an organizational context comes from his 1976 paper on "Educational Organizations as Loosely Coupled Systems"(published in the Administrative Science Quarterly), revisited in his review of subsequent uses of the concept, with JD Orton, in 1990's "Loosely Coupled Systems: A Reconceptualization".
Loose coupling in Weick's sense is a term intended to capture the necessary degree of flex between an organization's internal abstraction of reality, its theory of the world, on the one hand, and the concrete material actuality within which it finally acts, on the other. A loose coupling is what makes it possible for these ontologically incompatible entities to exist and act on each other, without shattering (akin to Castoriadis's idea of 'articulation'). Orton and Weick argue in favour of uses of the term which consciously preserve the dialectic it captures between the subjective and the objective, and against uses of the term which 'resolve' the dialectic by folding it into one side or the other.
Sensemaking.
People try to make sense of organizations, and organizations themselves try to make sense of their environment. Weick pays attention to questions of ambiguity and uncertainty in this sense-making, which is known as equivocality in organizational research that adopts information processing theory. His contributions to the theory of sensemaking include research papers such as his detailed analysis of the breakdown of sensemaking in the case of the Mann Gulch disaster, in which he defines the notion of a 'cosmology episode' - a challenge to assumptions that causes participants to question their own capacity to act.
Mindfulness.
Karl Weick introduced the term mindfulness into the organizational and safety literatures in the article "Organizing for high reliability: Processes of collective mindfulness" (1999). Weick develops the term “mindfulness” from Langer's (1989) work, who uses it to describe individual cognition. Weick's innovation was transferring this concept into the organizational literature as “collective mindfulness.” The effective adoption of collective mindfulness characteristics by an organization appears to cultivate safer cultures that exhibit improved system outcomes. The term high reliability organization (HRO) is an emergent property described by Weick (and Karlene Roberts at UC-Berkeley). Highly mindful organizations characteristically exhibit: a) Preoccupation with failure, b) Reluctance to simplify c) Sensitivity to operations, d) Commitment to Resilience, and e) Deference to Expertise.
Karl Weick explained that mindfulness is when we realize our current expectations, continuously improve those expectations based on new experiences, and implement those expectations to improve the current situation into a better one.
Organizational Information Theory.
Organizational information theory builds upon general systems theory, and focuses on the complexity of information management within an organization. The theory addresses how organizations reduce equivocally, or uncertainty through a process of information collection, management and use.

<doc id="5954923" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5954923" title="Nouvelle Théologie">
Nouvelle Théologie

Nouvelle Théologie (French for "New Theology") is the name commonly used to refer to a school of thought in Catholic theology that arose in the mid-20th century, most notably among certain circles of French and German theologians. The shared objective of these theologians was a fundamental reform of the dominance of Catholic theology by neo-Scholasticism, which had resulted in the dominance of teaching by scholastically-influenced manuals, criticism of modernism by the Church and a defensive stance towards non-Catholic faiths. The influence of the movement was important as a counterpoint to the widespread neo-Scholasticism of Catholic thought, especially through its influence on the reforms initiated at the Second Vatican Council.
Origins.
In the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century (especially after the issuing of the encyclical "Aeterni Patris" by Pope Leo XIII in 1879), Roman Catholic thought was dominated by neo-Scholastic forms of thought. This, in reaction against "modernist" theology, insisted on a rigid adherence to the thought, methods and principles of the thirteenth-century thinker Thomas Aquinas. This dominance became particularly pronounced in the early twentieth century, as exemplified by the issuing of the Anti-Modernist Oath by Pope Pius X in 1910, and the publication in 1914 of 24 allegedly Thomist propositions which had to be taught in all colleges as fundamental elements of theology.
The roots of a questioning of the dominance of neo-Scholasticism may be traced to work done from the 1920s onwards. Some French Jesuit studies made in exile at Ore Place, Hastings in 1906-26 might be seen as forerunners of the "nouvelle théologie". However, the "nouvelle théologie" movement itself is generally associated with the period between c 1935 and 1960. The movement in its early stages (i.e. the 1930s and early 1940s) is also particularly associated with the French language – a contrast with the Latin used in seminary teaching at the time.
Theologians who are nowadays identified as early forerunners of the "nouvelle théologie" sought a return of Catholic theology to (what they perceived was) its original purity of thought and expression. To accomplish this, they advocated a "return to the sources" of the Christian faith: namely, scripture and the writings of the Church Fathers. This methodological move is known by its French name, "ressourcement" ("return to the sources"). Along with this, the movement adopted a systemic openness to dialogue with the contemporary world on issues of theology. They developed also a renewed interest in biblical exegesis, typology, art, literature and mysticism.
Criticism.
The developing movement received fierce criticisms in the late 1940s and 1950s. A first attack was made by the influential Dominican theologian Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange in a polemical 1946 article in the journal "Angelicum". It is from this attack that the name for the movement, ""Nouvelle Théologie"", arises. While the theologians of the movement generally preferred to call their movement a ""ressourcement"", based on their return to original patristic thought, this enjoyed less popular coinage than the pejorative label of ""nouvelle théologie"", as most memorably given to the movement by Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange’s 1946 attack. Garrigou-Lagrange claimed that the theologians of the movement did not "return to the sources" but deviated from the long-standing theological tradition of the Catholic Church, thus creating a 'new theology' all their own (a "new theology" which, claimed Garrigou-Lagrange, was essentially the feared "modernism" in disguise).
In his essay in "Angelicum", Garrigou-Lagrange quotes Father Henri Boulliard as saying “The ideas employed by St. Thomas are simply Aristotelian notions applied to theology...By renouncing the Aristotelian system, modern thought abandoned the ideas, design and dialectical opposites which only made sense as functions of that system.” Thus, Garrigou-Lagrange asks "How then can the reader evade the conclusion, namely that, since it is no longer current, the theology of St. Thomas is a false theology? ...Further, how can “an unchanging truth” maintain itself if the two notions united by the verb to be, are essentially variable or changeable?" 
Subsequently, many of these criticisms of the ideas involved in the "nouvelle théologie" were developed by Pope Pius XII in his 1950 enyclical Humani Generis. These are, for example, rejecting the traditional dogmatic formulations that emerged throughout Church history as a result of scholastic theology, re-interpreting Catholic dogma in a way that was inconsistent with tradition, falling into the error of dogmatic relativism and criticizing biblical texts in a way that deviated from the principles of biblical hermeneutics outlined by his predecessors (principally Leo XIII). Pope Pius XII warned that the movement approached the error of modernism, a heresy vehemently condemned by Pope St Pius X in 1907.
Ideas.
Although lumped together as a set by their opponents, the theologians associated with the "nouvelle théologie" had a great range of interests, views and methodologies, and were not themselves a co-ordinated group. In later writing, Yves Congar, Henri de Lubac and Henri Bouillard all denied that the "nouvelle théologie" was anything but a construct of its opponents. However, subsequent studies of the movement have suggested that there did exist a set of shared characteristics among writers of the "nouvelle théologie". These include:
The theologians usually associated with "Nouvelle Théologie" are Henri de Lubac, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Yves Congar, Karl Rahner, Hans Küng, Edward Schillebeeckx, Marie-Dominique Chenu, Louis Bouyer, Jean Daniélou, Jean Mouroux and Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI).
Vatican II.
Theologians from this school of thought had a significant influence on the reforms brought about in the Catholic Church by the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). In the aftermath of the Council, the movement became divided into two camps, splitting in effect into left and right wings, over the interpretation and implementation of the Council, with Rahner, Congar, Schillebeeckx, Küng, and Chenu founding the more progressive theological journal "Concilium" in 1965, and de Lubac, Balthasar, Ratzinger, and others founding the theological journal "Communio" in 1972.

Phaeder

Phaeder is a fictional supervillain in the Marvel Comics universe. He is the father of Maelstrom.
Fictional character biography.
Phaeder was an Inhuman geneticist. Approximately a century ago, Phaeder was exiled from Attilan for daring to suggest the possibility of cloning. Agon, father of Black Bolt, was part of the Inhuman council of genetics that exiled him. Phaeder then cloned himself, and slew the clone, to cover his tracks as he left his home.
Phaeder took up residence with the Deviants in Lemuria, where he mated with a Deviant named Morga who gave birth to Maelstrom. When Maelstrom's paternity was discovered, Morga was put to death and Maelstrom was put in the Deviants's slave pits. Eventually Phaeder rescued Maelstrom and brought him back to his secret laboratory in the ruins of Attilan. Together they took Phaeder's research even farther: they perfected a technique for cheating death by transferring one's mind to a cloned body, a technique utilized multiple times by the Red Skull.
Eventually Phaeder grew too old and decrepit to survive a soul transfer. Maelstrom tended to him while carrying out his own research. After Maelstrom's agents stole technology from the Inhumans, their base was invaded by the Thing, Black Bolt and others. Unable to escape, Maelstrom ordered Deathurge to slay both himself and his comatose father. Maelstrom survived by transferring to a new body, but Phaeder died his final death.
Powers and abilities.
Phaeder has been attributed as providing secrets of human genetics to Magneto, the High Evolutionary, Arnim Zola, the Jackal, the Enclave (creators of Adam Warlock), and Doctor Hydro (an obscure Namor villain, leader of the Hydro-Men).

Austin History Center

The Austin History Center is the local history collection of the Austin Public Library and the city's historical archive, located at 810 Guadalupe Street in Austin, Texas, United States. It is regarded as one of the best such facilities in the United States. 
The building opened as the official Austin Public Library in 1933 and served as the main library until 1979, when library functions moved to the John Henry Faulk Library, a newer facility next door. Its site, which overlooks one of four public squares platted in Austin in 1839, was obtained from the Texas Legislature in 1913 for construction of a public library. The Italian renaissance structure completed in 1933, is considered to be the most prominent public work of Austin native Hugo Kuehne, founding dean of the University of Texas School of Architecture. The building also contains work by several Austin craftsmen, including ironworker Fortunat Wiegl, wood-carver Peter Mansbendel, and fresco artist Harold "Bubi" Jessen.
The Austin History Center celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2005. As of 2008 it houses thousands of documents, photographs, maps, artifacts, and personal histories. It features special exhibits and speakers on a regular basis.
The historic library building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1993. A Texas Historical Commission marker placed in front of the library identifies it as a Texas Historic Landmark recorded in 1993.

Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria

Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria (8 December 1756, Vienna – 26 July 1801) was an Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, a Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, and the last child of the Habsburg ruler Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor. His siblings included two Holy Roman Emperors (Joseph II and Leopold II), as well as Queen Marie Antoinette of France and Queen Maria Carolina of Two Sicilies. He was the last Elector of Cologne and an early patron of Ludwig van Beethoven.
Biography.
Maximilian Francis was born at the Hofburg Imperial Palace, Austria. In 1780 he succeeded his uncle Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine as Hochmeister (Grand Master) of the Teutonic Knights.
In 1784 he became Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, living in the archbishopric's seat at Bonn. He remained in that office until his death, meaning that he participated as Elector in the election of his brother Leopold II in 1790 and later that of his nephew Francis II in 1792.
Maximilian Francis succeeded to the title of Elector of Cologne and the related Bishopric of Münster and maintained his noble court in Bonn. A keen patron of music, Maximilian Francis maintained a court orchestra where Ludwig van Beethoven's father was a tenor in the court chapel and played an important role in the early career of Ludwig van Beethoven. The young Beethoven was an employee in his court's musical establishment, where his grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven, had been Kapellmeister.
The court organist was Christian Gottlob Neefe, who became an early mentor and teacher to Ludwig van Beethoven. Recognising his young pupil's remarkable gift both as a performer and a composer, Neefe brought Beethoven into the court, convincing Maximilian Francis to appoint him as assistant organist. Maximilian Francis, too, recognised the extraordinary abilities of the young Beethoven. In 1787, he gave Beethoven leave to visit Vienna to study with Mozart, a visit cut short by the illness and death of Beethoven's mother. In 1792, Maximilian again agreed to let Beethoven depart for Vienna in order to pursue studies with Joseph Haydn, Antonio Salieri and others, where he continued to pay Beethoven's court salary. Maximilian Francis maintained an interest in Beethoven's progress, and several letters from Haydn to Maximilian detailing his student's progress remain extant. The Archduke anticipated that Beethoven would return to Bonn and continue working for him, but in fact Beethoven never returned, choosing to pursue his career in Vienna.
Maximilian Francis's political rule over the Archbishopric met with disaster in 1794, when his domains were overrun by the troops of Revolutionary France. During the Napoleonic Wars, Cologne and Bonn were both occupied by the French army, in October and November of 1794. As the French approached, Maximilian Francis left Bonn never to return and his territories on the left bank of the Rhine eventually passed to France under the terms of the Treaty of Lunéville (1801). The Archbishop's court was dissolved. Although Maximilian Francis still retained his territories on the right bank of the Rhine, including Münster and the Duchy of Westphalia, the Elector, plagued by corpulence and ill-health, took up residence in Vienna after the loss of his capital and remained there until his death at age 45 in 1801, at Hetzendorf Palace. The dismantling of the court made Beethoven's relocation to Vienna permanent, and his stipend was terminated.
Beethoven planned to dedicate his First Symphony to his former patron, but Maximilian Francis died before it was completed.
In conspiracy theories, such as the one promoted in "The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail", Maximilian Francis was alleged to be the twenty-second Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.

I'm the Boss!

"I'm the Boss!" is a board game by American designer Sid Sackson. It is a negotiation game in which a group of players compete and cooperate to put together profitable business deals. The goal is to make the most money. "I'm the Boss" is currently published by Face2Face Games. It was previously published as "Kohle, Kies & Knete".
Rules.
The money is sorted into denominations. Each player is randomly issued investor cards (usually one), with remainders placed face up near the board. The player with the first investor alphabetically will play first; the player to his right chooses which board space to place the dollar marker upon. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards. The tiles are sorted in order and placed on the board.
Players act in turn. On each game turn, the acting player may either leave the marker in place or roll the die and advance the marker. If he does the latter, he may either play the new space or draw three cards from the deck.
If a player does not draw cards, he may attempt to make a deal based on the current board position. Notations on the board dictate which investors must be involved to close the deal, as well as the number of shares that will pay out. The tile indicates the share price. Most spaces offer choices as to which investors to involve, while some do not.
In order for a deal to occur, players who control the required investors must agree to the terms proposed by the acting player. Terms may only specify which investors will be involved and how the total proceeds of the deal will be distributed: no other offer of consideration is legal play. Players need not control an investor involved in the deal in order to be included in its terms. In particular, the acting player may propose a deal where he draws proceeds merely for the service of allowing the deal to go through.
If an agreement is reached, the proceeds (share price × number of shares) are distributed as agreed. The current tile is placed over the current board space, indicating that the deal was done. Such spaces are skipped in future board movement. If the acting player cannot bring negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, he may end his turn. No proceeds are generated and the current tile and board space remain as before.
At any time during negotiations, cards may be played. These can have a variety of effects under different circumstances, including:
The game ends after the conclusion of one of the last few deals on the tile stack. From the tenth tile onward, there is an increasing probability (marked on the reverse of the tile) for a die roll to immediately end the game. The game ends automatically after the fifteenth tile, if it is reached.
The player with the most money is the winner.

Facel Vega Facel II

The Facel Vega 'Facel II' was a French Grand Touring car produced by Facel between the years 1962 and 1964.
By 1962 the Paris-based Facel Vega company was facing bankruptcy. The Facel II (pronounced '2') was to be the company's last attempt to create a luxury GT car in the French tradition. Jean Daninos, Facel's founder and president, said of the Facel II, "The HK 500 was the most interesting car we ever made but the Facel II was by far the best. It was totally " 'elegant' ".
The Facel Vega company advertised the Facel II as ""Le Coupé 4-places le plus rapide du Monde"" ('The Fastest 4-seater Coupé in the World'). 'Sports Car Graphic' described it as a "luxurious brute". Bernard Cahier, a race-driver who tested the car in 1962, said of an early version (without the later limited-slip differential) that "the huge output of the Chrysler engine made it easy to spin wheels at light throttle pressure."
It was powered by an American 6.3 litre (383 cu.in.) Chrysler 'Typhoon' engine which produced in automatic-gearbox form and in manual. Using Chrysler's three-speed Torqueflite automatic gearbox, the 6.3-litre Facel II could reach over 135 mph (225 km/h). With a French Pont-a-Mousson four-speed manual gearbox the full-four-seater 6.3 litre Facel II could attain over 150 mph (247 km/h) and out-accelerate its two-seater rivals, the Aston Martin DB4, Ferrari 250 GT and 'gull-wing' Mercedes-Benz 300SL, to and all except the Ferrari to 100 mph (160 km/h). Dunlop disc brakes were fitted on all four wheels and Hydrosteer power steering, leather seats, electric windows and radio aerial all became standard during the production run, with Armstrong Selecta-Ride shock-absorbers adjustable from the dash while driving fitted to the right-hand-drive British models. The curvaceous wrap-round dash was in fact metal but meticulously painted to look like wood. Many of the controls were airplane inspired. The later manuals were fitted with the even more powerful 6.7 litre (413 cu.in.) Chrysler "RB" wedge engine and were faster still.
Like its predecessor, the Facel Vega HK500, the Facel II was heavier than its two-seater rivals, weighing (37 cwt) 'dry' and almost two tons with four passengers and a full petrol tank. There may have been some question about its ride and rear suspension - it used suspension virtually unchanged from the previous HK500 - but certainly none about its speed or glamour.
England's 'Autocar' said of it, ""To step down into a Facel II and go motoring must be the ambition of many who can never fulfil it. Such an experience is reserved for the few who can afford to buy one and for their friends and acquaintances"". For 'Motor'," "There are faster sports cars, although very few, and there are more refined and luxurious saloons, but it is difficult to think of a more remarkable combination of these rather conflicting qualities ... its unique combination of qualities left the most vivid impression on everyone who drove it. In particular one remembers the smoothness and silence, the effortless gate of a car which does at only 3,650 rpm. and the acceleration which leaves other fast cars far behind on every straight. One can enjoy the latest refinements of American brute force with European standards of control in an environment of British luxury and French elegance"".
Famous owners.
The Facel II was very expensive and highly exclusive. Its handsome design led to famous owners, including Pablo Picasso, Lionel Bart, Lord Brabourne, The Chrysler Corporation (and Mrs Carr, Walter Chrysler's daughter), Joan Collins, Tony Curtis, Christian Dior, Stanley Donen, Charlie Drake, Max Factor Jr, Joan Fontaine, Ava Gardner (who bought three), The Marchioness of Huntly (whose car had full-harness seat-belts), Herbert von Karajan, Danny Kaye, Louis Malle, The President of Mexico, Princess Grace of Monaco, Yves Montand, Hassan II King of Morocco, Baroness Sally Oppenheim-Barnes, William S. Paley, Prince Poniatowski, Anthony Quinn, Debbie Reynolds, Frank Sinatra, Ringo Starr, The Marchioness of Tavistock, François Truffaut, Count Giovanni Volpi di Misurata, Robert Wagner, Sir Mortimer Wheeler, The Shah of Persia and Sihanouk (King-Father of Cambodia). Race drivers Sir Stirling Moss, Maurice Trintignant, Tony Vandervell and Rob Walker also had Facels.
Demise.
In August 1961 Jean Daninos was obliged to offer his resignation and in 1964 the Facel company went into receivership, largely due to warranty claims against Facel Vega's smaller Facellia with its troublesome 'in-house' engine. As a result, Facel II production had to be discontinued with only 180 Facel IIs ever built.
The remaining Facel IIs are now amongst the most sought-after of all 1960s Grand Tourers. On 6 February 2014 Bonhams in Paris auctioned a rusty and derelict 'barn-find' left-hand-drive Facel II in need of a total-rebuild restoration for €155,250 [= approx £129,000/$211,000 at the time]. On 1 December 2013 Bonhams in London auctioned a partially restored right-hand-drive Facel II for £337,500 [= approx €407,000/$552,500 at the time].

Organofluorine chemistry

E: triflic acid

Organofluorine chemistry describes the chemistry of organofluorine compounds, organic compounds that contain the carbon–fluorine bond. Organofluorine compounds find diverse applications ranging from oil- and water-repellents to pharmaceuticals, refrigerants and reagents in catalysis. In addition to these applications, some organofluorine compounds are pollutants because of contributions to ozone depletion, global warming, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. The area of organofluorine chemistry often requires special techniques associated with the handling of fluorinating agents.
The carbon–fluorine bond.
Fluorine has several distinctive differences from all other substituents encountered in organic molecules. As a result, the physical and chemical properties of organofluorines can be distinctive in comparison to other organohalogens.
In comparison to aryl chlorides and bromides, aryl fluorides form Grignard reagents only reluctantly. On the other hand, aryl fluorides, e.g. fluoroanilines and fluorophenols, often undergo nucleophilic substitution efficiently.
Types of organofluorine compounds.
Hydrofluorocarbons.
Hydrofluorocarbons, organic compounds that contain fluorine and hydrogen atoms, are the most common type of organofluorine compounds. Used as refrigerants in place of the older chlorofluorocarbons such as R-12 and hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as R-21, they do not harm the ozone layer like the compounds they replace. However, they do contribute to a different process: global warming. Their atmospheric concentrations and rising contribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly increasing, causing international concern about the radiative forcing caused by HFCs.
Fluorocarbons with few C-F bonds behave similarly to the parent hydrocarbons, but their reactivity can be altered significantly. For example, both uracil and 5-fluorouracil are colourless, high-melting crystalline solids, but the latter is a potent anti-cancer drug. The use of the C-F bond in pharmaceuticals is predicated on this altered reactivity. Several drugs and agrochemicals contain only one fluorine center or one trifluoromethyl group.
Fluorocarbons and fluorocarbon derivatives.
Fluorocarbon based molecules are more chemically and thermally stable than hydrocarbons, reflecting the relative inertness of the C-F bond. They are also relatively lipophobic. Because of the reduced intermolecular van der Waals interactions, fluorocarbon-based compounds are often lubricants or are highly volatile. Gas soluble fluorocarbon liquids have medical applications. Fully fluorinated organic compounds, sometimes called perfluorocarbons or fluorocarbons, contain only carbon and fluorine. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are typically highly fluorinated.
Fluoropolymers.
Polymeric organofluorine compounds are numerous and commercially significant. They range from fully fluorinated species, e.g. PTFE to partially fluorinated, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride (and polychlorotrifluoroethylene ([CFClCF2n).
The structure of organofluorine compounds can be distinctive, again reflecting the polarizing character of the C-F bond. Fluorination affects packing of organofluorine molecules with hydrocarbons. As shown below, perfluorinated aliphatic compounds tend to segregate from hydrocarbons. This "like dissolves like effect" is related to the usefulness of fluorous phases and the use of PFOA in processing of fluoropolymers. In contrast to the aliphatic derivatives, perfluoroaromatic derivatives tend to form mixed phases with nonfluorinated aromatic compounds, resulting from donor-acceptor interactions between the pi-systems.
Fluorocarbenes.
As indicated throughout this article, fluorine-substituents lead to reactivity that differs strongly from classical organic chemistry. The premier example is difluorocarbene, CF2, which is a singlet whereas carbene (CH2) has a triplet ground state. This difference is significant because difluorocarbene is a precursor to tetrafluoroethylene.
Methods for preparation of C-F bonds.
Organofluorine compounds are prepared by numerous routes, depending on the degree and regiochemistry of fluorination sought and the nature of the precursors. The direct fluorination of hydrocarbons with F2, often diluted with N2, is useful for highly fluorinated compounds:
Such reactions however are often unselective and require care because hydrocarbons can uncontrollably "burn" in , analogous to the combustion of hydrocarbon in . For this reason, alternative fluorination methodologies have been developed. Generally, such methods are classified into two classes.
Electrophilic fluorination.
Electrophilic fluorination rely on sources of "F+". Often such reagents feature N-F bonds, for example F-TEDA-BF4. Asymmetric fluorination, whereby only one of two possible enantiomeric products are generated from a prochiral substrate, rely on electrophilic fluorination reagents. Illustrative of this approach is the preparation of a precursor to anti-inflammatory agents:
Electrosynthetic methods.
A specialized but important method of electrophilic fluorination involves electrosynthesis. The method is mainly used to perfluorinate, i.e. replace all C–H bonds by C–F bonds. The hydrocarbon is dissolved or suspended in liquid HF, and the mixture is electrolyzed at 5–6 V using Ni anodes. The method was first demonstrated with the preparation of perfluoropyridine () from pyridine (). Several variations of this technique have been described, including the use of molten potassium bifluoride or organic solvents.
Nucleophilic fluorination.
The major alternative to electrophilic fluorination is, naturally, nucleophilic fluorination using reagents that are sources of "F-," for Nucleophilic displacement typically of chloride and bromide. Metathesis reactions employing alkali metal fluorides are the simplest.
The decomposition of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates in the Sandmeyer or Schiemann reactions exploit fluoroborates as F- sources.
Although hydrogen fluoride may appear to be an unlikely nucleophile, it is the most common source of fluoride in the synthesis of organofluorine compounds. Such reactions are often catalysed by metal fluorides such as chromium trifluoride. 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane, a replacement for CFC's, is prepared industrially using this approach:
Notice that this transformation entails two reaction types, metathesis (replacement of Cl- by F-) and hydrofluorination of an alkene.
Deoxofluorination.
Deoxofluorination agents effect the replacement hydroxyl and carbonyl groups with one and two fluorides, respectively. One such reagent, useful for fluoride for oxide exchange in carbonyl compounds, is sulfur tetrafluoride: 
Alternates to SF4 include the diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST, NEt2SF3) and bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride (deoxo-fluor). These organic reagents are easier to handle and more selective:
From fluorinated building blocks.
Many organofluorine compounds are generated from reagents that deliver perfluoroalkyl and perfluoroaryl groups. (Trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane, CF3Si(CH3)3, is used as a source of the trifluoromethyl group, for example. Among the available fluorinated building blocks are CF3X (X = Br, I), C6F5Br, and C3F7I. These species form Grignard reagents that then can be treated with a variety of electrophiles. The development of fluorous technologies (see below, under solvents) is leading to the development of reagents for the introduction of "fluorous tails."
A special but significant application of the fluorinated building block approach is the synthesis of tetrafluoroethylene, which is produced on a large-scale industrially via the intermediacy of difluorocarbene. The process begins with the thermal (600-800 °C) dehydrochlorination of chlorodifluoromethane:
Sodium fluorodichloroacetate (CAS# 2837-90-3) is used to generate chlorofluorocarbene, for cyclopropanations.
18F-Delivery methods.
The usefulness of fluorine-containing radiopharmaceuticals in 18F-positron emission tomography has motivated the development of new methods for forming C-F bonds. Because of the short half-life of 18F, these syntheses must be highly efficient, rapid, and easy. Illustrative of the methods is the preparation of fluoride-modified glucose by displacement of a triflate by a labeled fluoride nucleophile:
Applications.
Organofluorine chemistry impacts many areas of everyday life and technology. The C-F bond is found in pharmaceuticals, agrichemicals, fluoropolymers, refrigerants, surfactants, anesthetics, oil-repellents, catalysis, and water-repellents, among others.
Pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.
The carbon-fluorine bond is commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.
Inhaler Propellant.
This is also used as a propellant for inhalers used to administer asthma medications. It is referred to as HFA and replaces CFC propellant based inhalers. CFC inhalers were banned because of environmental concerns with the ozone layer. HFA propellant inhalers like FloVent and ProAir ( Salbutamol ) have no generic versions available as of November 2012.
Fluorosurfactants.
Fluorosurfactants, which have a polyfluorinated "tail" and a hydrophilic "head", serve surfactants because they concentrate at the liquid-air interface due to their lipophobicity. Fluorosurfactants have low surface energies and dramatically lower surface tension. The fluorosurfactants perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two of the most studied because of their ubiquity, toxicity, and long residence times in humans and wildlife.
Solvents.
Fluorinated compounds often display distinct solubility properties. Dichlorodifluoromethane and chlorodifluoromethane were widely used refrigerants. CFCs have potent ozone depletion potential due to the homolytic cleavage of the carbon-chlorine bonds; their use is largely prohibited by the Montreal Protocol. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), such as tetrafluoroethane, serve as CFC replacements because they do not catalyze ozone depletion. Oxygen exhibits a high solubility in perfluorocarbon compounds, reflecting again on their lipophilicity. Perfluorodecalin has been demonstrated as a blood substitutes, transporting oxygen to the lungs.
The solvent 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has been used for extraction of natural products such as taxol, evening primrose oil, and vanillin. 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is an oxidation-resistant polar solvent.
Organofluorine reagents.
The development of organofluorine chemistry has contributed many reagents of value beyond organofluorine chemistry. Triflic acid (CF3SO3H) and trifluoroacetic acid (CF3CO2H) are useful throughout organic synthesis. Their strong acidity is attributed to the electronegativity of the trifluoromethyl group that stabilizes the negative charge. The triflate-group (the conjugate base of the triflic acid) is a good leaving group in substitution reactions.
Fluorous phases.
Of topical interest in the area of "Green Chemistry," highly fluorinated substituents, e.g. perfluorohexyl (C6F13) confer distinctive solubility properties to molecules, which facilitates purification of products in organic synthesis. This area, described as "fluorous chemistry," exploits the concept of like-dissolves-like in the sense that fluorine-rich compounds dissolve preferentially in fluorine-rich solvents. Because of the relative inertness of the C-F bond, such fluorous phases are compatible with even harsh reagents. This theme has spawned techniques of "fluorous tagging" and "fluorous protection". Illustrative of fluorous technology is the use of fluoroalkyl-substituted tin hydrides for reductions, the products being easily separated from the spent tin reagent by extraction using fluorinated solvents.
Hydrophobic fluorinated ionic liquids, such as organic salts of bistriflimide or hexafluorophosphate, can form phases that are insoluble in both water and organic solvents, producing multiphasic liquids.
Organofluorine ligands in transition metal chemistry.
Organofluorine ligands have long been featured in organometallic and coordination chemistry. One advantage to F-containing ligands is the convenience of 19F NMR spectroscopy for monitoring reactions. The organofluorine compounds can serve as a "sigma-donor ligand," as illustrated by the titanium(III) derivative [(C5Me5)2Ti(FC6H5)]BPh4. Most often, however, fluorocarbon substituents are used to enhance the Lewis acidity of metal centers. A premier example is "Eufod," a coordination complex of europium(III) that features a perfluoroheptyl modified acetylacetonate ligand. This and related species are useful in organic synthesis and as "shift reagents" in NMR spectroscopy.
In an area where coordination chemistry and materials science overlap, the fluorination of organic ligands is used to tune the properties of component molecules. For example, the degree and regiochemistry of fluorination of metalated 2-phenylpyridine ligands in platinum(II) complexes significantly modifies the emission properties of the complexes.
The coordination chemistry of organofluorine ligands also embraces fluorous technologies. For example, triphenylphosphine has been modified by attachment of perfluoroalkyl substituents that confer solubility in perfluorohexane as well as supercritical carbon dioxide. As a specific example, [(C8F17C3H6-4-C6H4)3P.
C-F bond activation.
An active area of organometallic chemistry encompasses the scission of C-F bonds by transition metal-based reagents. Both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions have been developed and are of interest from the perspectives of organic synthesis and remediation of xenochemicals. C-F bond activation has been classified as follows "(i) oxidative addition of fluorocarbon, (ii) M–C bond formation with HF elimination, (iii) M–C bond formation with fluorosilane elimination, (iv) hydrodefluorination of fluorocarbon with M–F bond formation, (v) nucleophilic attack on fluorocarbon, and (vi) defluorination of fluorocarbon." An illustrative metal-mediated C-F activation reaction is the defluorination of fluorohexane by a zirconium dihydride, an analogue of Schwartz's reagent:
Fluorocarbon anions in Ziegler-Natta catalysis.
Fluorine-containing compounds are often featured in noncoordinating or weakly coordinating anions. Both tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, B(C6F5)4-, and the related tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate, are useful in Ziegler-Natta catalysis and related alkene polymerization methodologies. The fluorinated substituents render the anions weakly basic and enhance the solubility in weakly basic solvents, which are compatible with strong Lewis acids.
Materials science.
Organofluorine compounds enjoy many niche applications in materials science. With a low coefficient of friction, fluid fluoropolymers are used as specialty lubricants. Fluorocarbon-based greases are used in demanding applications. Representative products include Fomblin and Krytox, manufactured by Solvay Solexis and DuPont, respectively. Certain firearm lubricants such as "Tetra Gun" contain fluorocarbons. Capitalizing on their nonflammability, fluorocarbons are used in fire fighting foam. Organofluorine compounds are components of liquid crystal displays. The polymeric analogue of triflic acid, nafion is a solid acid that is used as the membrane in most low temperature fuel cells. The bifunctional monomer 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone is a precursor to PEEK-class polymers.
Biosynthesis of organofluorine compounds.
In contrast to the many naturally-occurring organic compounds containing the heavier halides, chloride, bromide, and iodide, only a handful of biologically synthesized carbon-fluorine bonds are known. The most common natural organofluorine species is fluoroacetate, a toxin found in a few species of plants. Others include fluorooleic acid, fluoroacetone, nucleocidin (4'-fuoro-5'-O-sulfamoyladenosine), fluorothreonine, and 2-fluorocitrate. Several of these species are probably biosynthesized from fluoroacetaldehyde. The enzyme fluorinase catalyzed the synthesis of 5'-fluoro-5-deoxyadenosine (see scheme to right).
History.
Organofluorine chemistry began in the 1800s with the development of organic chemistry as a whole. The first organofluorine compounds were prepared by metathesis reactions using antimony trifluoride as the F- source. The nonflammability and nontoxicity of the chlorofluorocarbons CCl3F and CCl2F2 attracted industrial attention in the 1920s. In the 1930s, scientists at duPont discovered polytetrafluoroethylene. Subsequent major developments, especially in the US, benefited from expertise gained in the production of uranium hexafluoride. Starting in the late 1940s, a series of electrophilic fluorinating methodologies were introduced, beginning with CoF3. About this time, electrochemical fluorination ("electrofluorination") was announced, having been developed in the 1930s with the goal of generating highly stable perfluorinated materials compatible with uranium hexafluoride. These new methodologies allowed the synthesis of C-F bonds without using elemental fluorine and without relying on metathetical methods. In 1957, the anticancer activity of 5-fluorouracil was described. This report provided one of the first examples of rational design of drugs. This discovery sparked a surge of interest in fluorinated pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. The discovery of the noble gas compounds, e.g. XeF4, provided a host of new reagents starting in the early 1960s. In the 1970s, fluorodeoxyglucose was established as a useful reagent in 18F positron emission tomography. In Nobel Prize-winning work, CFC's were shown to contribute to the depletion of atmospheric ozone. This discovery alerted the world to the negative consequences of organofluorine compounds and motivated the development of new routes to organofluorine compounds. In 2002, the first C-F bond-forming enzyme, fluorinase, was reported.
Environmental and health concerns.
Some organofluorine compounds pose significant risks and dangers to health and the environment. CFCs and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) deplete the ozone layer and are potent greenhouse gases. HFCs are potent greenhouse gases and are facing calls for stricter international regulation and phase out schedules as a fast acting greenhouse emission abatement measure, as are perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Fluorosurfactants, such as PFOS and PFOA, are persistent and global contaminants. Many organofluorine compounds are bioactive and some are quite toxic, such as fluoroacetate and perfluoroisobutene.
Because of the compound's effect on climate, the G-20 major economies agreed in 2013 to support iniatives to phase out use of HCFCs. They affirmed the roles of the Montreal Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in global HCFC accounting and reduction. The U.S. and China at the same time announced a bilateral agreement to similar effect.

Lemuel H. Wells

Lemuel Henry Wells (December 3, 1841 – March 27, 1936) was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane. 
Early years.
Born in Yonkers, New York, Wells lived a sheltered childhood, and as a boy experienced a desire to become a missionary. He entered Trinity College in 1860. Wells was visiting his father in Wisconsin in 1862 when the American Civil War broke out, and he was recruited as a member of the 32nd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. He fought in the Battle of Vicksburg in 1863, and in 1864 was mustered out and returned to Trinity College, from which he was graduated in 1867.
He prepared for ministry at Berkeley Divinity School (now part of Yale Divinity School) and was ordained a Deacon in 1869. A week after his graduation from Berkeley, Wells married Elizabeth Folger, ward of Charles J. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury. The marriage was short-lived, however, as Elizabeth died following a year spent in Europe. Wells, a newly ordained priest, determined to act on his earlier desire to become a missionary and Bishop Benjamin Wistar Morris of the then-frontier states of Oregon and Washington asked Wells to become rector of a struggling mission in Walla Walla, Washington.
Eastern Washington: 1871-1892.
In 1872, during his second year as rector in Walla Walla, Wells founded the St. Paul’s Girl’s School as well as a Boy’s School that was never as successful. In 1880, Wells married the principal of St. Paul’s Girl’s School, Henrietta Garretson, whose father was a senator of Pennsylvania. He established thirty-one Episcopal Missions in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho - in many places, Wells' mission was the first church or religious establishment in the region. These missions included the first Episcopal congregations in:
In 1882, Wells moved to Connecticut, but was called back to Western Washington in 1885, as rector of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, Tacoma. Charles Wright, a Tacoma railroad tycoon, was responsible for the splendid new St. Luke's, and had plans to found a Girls' School. He showed his plans to Henrietta Wells, who made several suggestions and was recruited as the first principal of Annie Wright Seminary, a venerable and successful Tacoma school. During Wells' tenure at St. Luke's, the congregation grew to such an extent that many mission churches were founded; many of Tacoma's present-day Episcopal congregations can trace their roots to Wells' influence at St. Luke's.
Bishop of Spokane: 1892-1915.
In 1892 the General Convention of the Episcopal Church divided the State of Washington into two Dioceses, the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia in the western part of the state, and the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane in the eastern part. It was Wells who determined on Spokane, WA as his See city, and he and his wife moved from Tacoma to Spokane after Wells was consecrated as the first Bishop of Spokane in New Haven, Connecticut in 1892. One of the Wells’ first acts in Spokane was to found another girls’ school – Brunot Hall, which was conceived and organized on the train ride back from New Haven following Wells’ consecration. While in Spokane he also founded St. Luke’s Hospital, Spokane. Wells became something of an international celebrity while Bishop of Spokane, being invited to two Lambeth Conferences in 1900 and 1910. While in England in 1900 he was seated next to Queen Victoria at a dinner, and amused her with stories of Ulysses S. Grant (under whom Wells had served during the American Civil War) and Abraham Lincoln, whom he had met on several occasions. The Queen, thinking that the "Washington" in which Wells served was the Nation’s Capital, and that Wells was a kind of chaplain to the President, invited him to family supper, and was not pleased to learn that her guest was, in fact, a missionary bishop in the rural northwest.
Retirement.
In 1915, Wells retired as Bishop of Spokane, recommending that a younger man would be much more suited to the rigors of horseback and stagecoach travel that was so much a part of his position. His report read as follows:
"When I first came to Eastern Washington as a missionary in 1871 I found only six communicants of the Church and nothing more in this whole district; no clergymen, no institutions. Now we have three thousand communicants, twenty clergymen, with twenty-two lay readers, ministering to sixty churches and missions. We have in successful operation – three boarding and day schools with twenty teachers and two hundred pupils, a hospital with fifty beds; a Church home for children with room for twenty-five orphans […] I doubt if any one of our mission fields can show a more remarkable growth toward self-support."
Bishop Wells and his third wife, Jane Sheldon (Henrietta Garretson having died in 1903) moved to Tacoma in their retirement. Wells was petitioned by the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane to record his memoirs upon his retirement in 1915, and in 1931 these were published as "A Pioneer Missionary." Wells died in 1936.

Pointcheval–Stern signature algorithm

In cryptography, the Pointcheval–Stern signature algorithm is a digital signature scheme based on the closely related ElGamal signature scheme. It changes the ElGamal scheme slightly to produce an algorithm which has been proven secure in a strong sense against adaptive chosen-message attacks. That is, if the discrete logarithm problem is intractable in a strong sense.
David Pointcheval and Jacques Stern developed the "forking lemma" technique in constructing their proof for this algorithm. It has been used in other security investigations of various cryptographic algorithms.

Geppetto (Fables)

Geppetto is a major character, albeit one that's rarely seen, in the comic book series "Fables", written by Bill Willingham and published by DC Comics as part of the Vertigo imprint.
His actions are responsible for the entire premise of the comic book, in that he is the being known as The Adversary who masterminded the conquest of the Fable homelands, forcing the Fables to flee into the mundane world. During the war against the Empire, he was the primary antagonist of the series before being given amnesty, having his role replaced by Mister Dark.
In 2009, Gepetto was ranked as IGN's 91st Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.
Fictional character biography.
Beginning.
Based on the character of Mister Geppetto from the book "The Adventures of Pinocchio", Geppetto is the creator of Pinocchio, the wooden boy who was ultimately, after a series of adventures, turned into a human boy by the Blue Fairy. However, it transpired that his conversion to human form had not cured Pinocchio of his wanderlust and the boy repeatedly left on adventures, often disappearing for years at a time, leaving Geppetto behind to wait in lonely solitude for his return.
Geppetto's solution seemed obvious, to create new children, initially older sons, operating under the assumption that they would prove more mature than Pinocchio, then turning his hand to daughters. The Blue Fairy continued to visit, and, every now and then, would take a liking to one of the children and turn them human. Having also been hurt by Pinocchio's vagabond nature, she altered her magic to include bonds of loyalty to Geppetto and of fealty to hearth and home.
Start of the Empire.
Life continued in a generally happy fashion until Geppetto was approached by the elders of the local community who were growing increasingly concerned about the erratic behaviour of the local Count. They proposed that he should be replaced; that Geppetto should create a double for the Count, persuade the Blue Fairy to turn him human, then, at some suitable point, replace the Count with his double. Despite initial misgivings, as the plan clearly had to involve the murder of the real Count, the switch was made and sanity settled back into the land. The new Count ruled wisely, but eventually the time came for him to pass away. His son was highly incompetent, so the decision was made to repeat the procedure.
As time passed, the process became habitual, and it wasn't too long before every major ruling official within range had been replaced by one of Geppetto's duplicates, and thus, through the Blue Fairy's magic, all of them were loyal to him. However, the Fairy ultimately tired of the game, putting Geppetto in a problematic situation. With his co-conspirators hungry to expand the territory that they controlled, the inability to turn the duplicates human was a problem. Geppetto began to research the magic himself; many of the lords under his control had court magicians in their service and were able to send them to Geppetto to instruct him in the ways of magic. Within a short period of time, Geppetto came to understand how the Blue Fairy performed her magic, but he lacked her unique magical nature, which acted as her power source. During her next visit, he solved that problem by attacking her and hooking her up to a system that allowed him to create elixirs from her body that could turn his duplicates human.
Becoming Emperor.
Geppetto now faced up to the problem of his co-conspirators. Too many people knew about what was happening and he felt that it would only be a matter of time before one of them revealed it. Some obligingly died of old age, but others were of Fablekind and refused to age. Acting entirely alone, Geppetto proceeded to kill and replace the remaining conspirators, while also continuing to replace local government officials from the surrounding areas. Without him really realising it, Geppetto's empire was well under way.
Expansion became the key to maintaining his empire, and Geppetto had by now developed a taste for ruling, taking the view that it was better that he should be in charge than someone who might prove to be less benevolent. However, a new problem had arisen. His empire had expanded to the extent that the nearby leaders were complete strangers to him, so it would not be possible to surreptitiously replace them. Subterfuge was no longer an option. Fortunately, by this point, Geppetto had control over a considerable military force, through the various lords under his control. Augmented by magically summoned creatures, his armies were able to overwhelm most opposition with some ease, especially since few (if any) expected the attacks. Geppetto also created the figure of the Emperor, a massively imposing figure, heavily armoured, to be his figurehead to inspire martial loyalty and to strike fear into enemy forces.
The empire continued to expand, operating on a fifty-year cycle of expansion and consolidation. Geppetto himself tends to stay out of direct control, allowing his sons and daughters, now numbering in the tens of thousands, to handle the day-to-day running of the empire. Geppetto prefers to remain in his cottage workshop, only occasionally getting involved to set policy and broad goals for the empire.
At the time of the Fables stories, the empire has absorbed all of the European Fable worlds (with a few exceptions, such as the kingdom of the North Wind) and is beginning a new expansion cycle, launching an assault on the Arabian fables.
Dealings with Fabletown.
Geppetto's attitude towards Fabletown was, for the most part, one of general disinterest. With many worlds for his Empire still to absorb, the mundane world was of little interest, and those Fables who had escaped there were of limited interest for the time being, although he did still consider them to be his subjects, albeit in what he considered to be self-imposed exile. He did not, however, intend to allow Fabletown to be a distraction and sent in a unit of his elite wooden soldiers with the aim of reclaiming all those magical items that the escaping Fables had managed to take with them when they fled (although it is implied that this was not the army's only purpose, as they apparently had plans to kill some of the Fables even if Fabletown did not resist). He sent them under the command of Baba Yaga, masquerading as Red Riding Hood, who he announced to the denizens of Fabletown was his Imperial Envoy, who would work to achieve reconciliation between them. Fabletown chose to resist and neither Baba Yaga nor any of the wooden soldiers returned to the Homelands.
His next encounter with Fabletown was the one-man invasion of the Homelands by Boy Blue. Armed with powerful magical artifacts, Blue caused a remarkable amount of disruption, slaying several Imperial governors as he made his way closer to the Imperial capitol, where he infiltrated the Emperor's throne room and decapitated the Emperor, who reverted to his original wooden form. Captured by the Snow Queen, Blue was brought to Geppetto, and the two conversed for some time, while Geppetto worked on repairing the Emperor puppet ready for returning him to a living form; Blue also returned Pinocchio's body to his grateful father, who had little difficulty in reviving his wayward offspring. Shortly afterwards, however, it became apparent that Blue had allowed himself to be captured in order to discover the true identity of the Adversary. Escaping with ease, he attempted to kill Geppetto, but failed due to the sheer number of protective spells that surrounded the older Fable. Angrily, Geppetto swore to send the Snow Queen after Blue to get revenge. Disturbed and confused, Pinocchio chose to stay with his father when Blue left.
His anger with Fabletown grew even further after their next encounter. Bigby Wolf infiltrated the Homelands and broke into Geppetto's cottage, where he explained that Fabletown would be adopting what he referred to as the Israel template. Any hurt inflicted on Fabletown would be returned several times over. Bigby then demonstrated this policy by using plastic explosive to destroy the grove of magical trees that Geppetto used to create the wooden soldiers, in retaliation for their assault on Fabletown. The resulting fire also destroyed Geppetto's cottage.
After these events, Geppetto finally decided that Fabletown had to be dealt with, and called a conference of the Imperial elite to discuss possible options. Although the final discussions at the conference had yet to be revealed, he seemed to have decided to wage all-out war on the mundane world, possibly to ultimately use the devastated world as a prison. He dispatched Hansel to Fabletown, ostensibly as an official envoy, but really with the mission of retrieving Baba Yaga and the surviving wooden soldiers and return them to the Homelands. As a result of Pinocchio's report on the likely retaliation from the mundane world, Geppetto decided that all the Fables in the mundane world will have to be assassinated prior to their attack, in order to prevent them from informing the mundane authorities of the source of the invasion and rallying them against the Empire. He ordered the Snow Queen to make the necessary plans and to contact Hansel to impress on him the urgency of his mission. Geppetto intended the attack to take place in three years time.
This all changed when Flycatcher engaged and completed his quest in forming a new kingdom called Haven. The Empire dispatched armies to destroy the newly formed land, but found themselves disabled as the spirits Flycatcher brought with him in the journey overwhelmed them. Making matters worse, the fallen soldiers jumped at Flycatcher's proposition to become citizens of Haven since the alternative would have been to return to the Empire to be killed for failure. Impatient, Geppetto ordered all of his Wooden Soldiers to march into Haven and crush it to the ground. However, the magical armor worn by Flycatcher added itself to the magic of the Sacred Grove, causing all the soldiers to sprout into trees and becoming a new Sacred Grove. Because there could only be one Sacred Grove in all the worlds, Geppetto's would never grow back and the magic he had used from it was now bestowed upon Flycatcher.
The loss of the soldiers, a number of them having been sons he had constructed in the past, caused Geppetto to fall into a deep depression, cared for only by one of his enchanted daughters. This left the rest of the Empire to battle the suddenly invading opposition from Fabletown themselves. The Empire ultimately failed, thanks in large part to Pinocchio revealing vital information in exchange for Geppetto to sign the Fabletown Compact and become a citizen of Fabletown. This managed to happen as Pinocchio realized that the loyalty spells were only so that he would act in Geppetto's best interest and he strongly believed that surrender was in his father's best interest.
Geppetto was none too happy that he no longer had an empire to run and was forced to follow the rules as a citizen of Fabletown. It was during a tour of the city with Pinocchio, aided very closely by Beast, Grimble and Hobbes, that he witnessed firsthand what he had done to the people who were forced out of their home world, but refused to believe that he did anything that was not in what he felt was the best interest of the people. Being a sorcerer, Geppetto lives on the thirteenth floor of The Woodlands building with the other magic users. However, he learned rather quickly that his links to outside sources had been severed and could only use spells when Frau Totenkinder allowed him to.
Geppetto was responsible for Mr. Dark's imprisonment, having recognized the threat he posed. When Mr. Dark escaped, the enchantments upon Fabletown began to fade until all of the structures collapsed. Geppetto only told riddles about the true nature of what happened before he was forced to join the others in relocating to the Farm. Soon after arriving, he slipped away from Pinocchio only to find himself confronted by Reynard The Fox, King Noble, and other animal residents. Geppetto maintained the protection spells that kept him from being harmed by their attack, but the animals then decided to bury him alive deep in the middle of the forest.
Geppetto was eventually freed from his burial imprisonment from a heavy rain which washed away the dirt over his burial spot. Seeking protection, Geppetto allied himself with Grandfather Oak, the oldest tree in the forests around the Fabletown Farm. Grandfather Oak provided Geppetto with two dryads, Prince Aspen and Princess Alder, as bodyguards.
Returning to the Farm, Geppetto sought election as the new head of the Farm, promising to solve the problem of Mr. Dark as he had many centuries ago. The Farm was split on what to do but when Rose Red, official leader of the Farm, recovered from a temporary suicidal depression, she put a quick end to Geppetto's move and appointed him one of her advisors. He is currently attempting to put a small wooden soldier spy in the new Sacred Grove so that he may learn its secrets and use it to replenish his power and salvage his Empire.
Personality.
Outwardly, Geppetto remains the amiable woodcarver of legend, polite and caring. His pleasant exterior, however, hides an utterly ruthless man whose forces are responsible for countless deaths across the Fable lands. He cares for his children, particularly Pinocchio. He does not seem to consider attacking Fabletown before he can steal back or negotiate the return of the damaged but still conscious heads of the soldiers he lost in "March of the Wooden Soldiers."
He is apparently reasonably magnanimous when he considers himself to have the upper hand, as when he felt that he had Boy Blue as his prisoner. His mask slips, however, when crossed. He beat Pinocchio after he presented him with a wooden bug he carved from the mystic grove. Geppetto threw him out of his cottage telling his confused son "no one carves from there but me!" Upon his arrival in Fabletown and signing of the compact that granted him immunity for his past actions, he is frequently condescending or hostile (albeit nonviolently so), often treating others as though he was still an emperor. This attitude fails to ingratiate himself to the citizens of Fabletown.
Powers and abilities.
While not physically strong, Geppetto has learned a great deal of magic over the years from the various wizards belonging to the lords under his control, to the extent that he should probably be considered a sorcerer of considerable power. He has every protective spell imaginable laid over him, making him effectively impregnable - he even shrugs off a blow from the Vorpal Blade, although he does express considerable surprise that the Blade actually remained intact, the only weapon ever to do so. Like all Fables, he is effectively ageless.
As the true power behind the empire, Geppetto has enormous power in the Homelands, even if that fact remains unrecognised by the vast majority of its citizens. To all intents and purposes his will is absolute within the borders of the empire. He has a huge military force at his disposal, along with considerable magical resources.
He remains a talented woodcarver and while he had access to his magic grove, he continued to make new children at a rate that he estimated to be around twenty per year. With the recent destruction of the magic grove that provided the wood and Flycatcher's recent acquisition of the grove's power, however, this is no longer possible.
Original plan.
Willingham originally intended for the Adversary to be revealed as Peter Pan. Peter would come to our world to steal children so they would remain young, becoming more corrupt. Also, it would turn out that Captain Hook was actually the hero attempting to rescue the children. However, DC discovered that Peter Pan was not in the public domain in Great Britain, unlike other "Fables" characters, and thus could not be used. Willingham thus used Geppetto, an idea he has since seen as better. The alias "The Adversary" appears based on "The Enemy," the common term for Sauron in the "Lord of the Rings". Both Hook and Pan make a brief appearance in 1001 Nights of Snowfall, fighting each other. It has also been theorized that the title "The Adversary" could be derived from Jewish and Christian literature where the name "Satan" actually comes from the Hebrew word for "Adversary."

Atheris desaixi

Atheris desaixi is a venomous viper species endemic to Kenya, where only two isolated populations are known. It is known for its striking black and yellow coloration. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Etymology.
This species is named in honor of Frank DeSaix, a Peace Corps volunteer who collected the first specimen.
Description.
Adults are an average 40-60 cm (about 16-24 inches) in total length (body + tail), with a maximum total length of . Newborns measure 17-22 cm (6.7-8.7 inches) in total length. In Ashe's original 1968 description, adults were reported to grow to an average 49-68 cm (about 19-27 inches) total length, with a head and body length of 43-59 cm (about 17-23 inches) and a tail length of 6-9 cm (2.4-3.5 inches).
The eyes are set well forward in the head and are surrounded by 14-17 scales. Interorbital scales number 8-11. The eye is separated from the nasal by two to three scales and from the supralabials by two. Upper labials: 10-12. Sublabials: 11-14. The rostral scale is not as wide as it is long, while its upper margin is highest at the center. The rostral is also accompanied by an even number of suprarostrals. The superciliary scales above the eyes are not enlarged (as opposed to "A. ceratophora"). The nasal scale is round and single, or partially divided.
Midbody, the dorsal scale rows number 24-31. The dorsal scales are short and heavily keeled. However, on the upper dorsals the keels terminate before the end of each scale. On the lower dorsals, the keels are serrated (like in "Echis"). The ventral scale count is 160-174. In females the subcaudals number 41-54. One male specimen had 53 subcaudals.
The color pattern consists of a greenish-black to charcoal-black ground color, while each scale is tipped with yellow or yellowish-green, giving the animal a speckled appearance. Some scales have more of this color to them and form a series of loops along the sides of the body. These loops may fuse into zigzag patterns posteriorly, fading again on the tail. Anteriorly, the venter is yellow or yellowish, fading towards a purplish-black towards the rear and under the tail, except for the tip that is blotched with yellow. Juveniles are mainly yellow with a white tipped tail. This darkens as they grow until they reach the adult color phase at a total length of about .
Geographic range.
Two isolated populations in Kenya: in the forests at Chuka, south-eastern Mount Kenya, and Igembe in the northern Nyambeni range. 
The type locality is listed as "near Chuka, Lat. 0° 20' S, Long. 37° 35' E, in rain forest at an altitude of c. 1600 meter ft", Kenya.
Conservation status.
Currently, this species is not listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species nor in any of the CITES Appendices. In 2004, a proposal was submitted by Kenya to have it listed in CITES Appendix II on the grounds that the species has a very limited geographic range and suffers from rapid habitat loss. It is also threatened by illegal trade due to demand from reptile collectors in Europe and North America. Apparently this proposal was not accepted. The Commission of European Communities considered the arguments weak, saying that they did not demonstrate significant trade, and that the species is already protected in Kenya. They suggested Appendix III instead.
Habitat.
The original specimens, for which field notes were taken, were found in dense rain forest at 1,600 m (5,250 ft), collected in clearings and along pathways in the dense foliage about 2 m (6.6 ft) above the ground. The conditions were very humid and all specimens were collected within a 1.6 km (1 mile) radius. In this environment, their coloration offers them an excellent camouflage, making them very difficult to spot.
Behavior.
Little is known. They are obviously arboreal, moving slowly and deliberately among the branches of their habitat as other "Atheris" species do, but it is unknown when their daily peak activity occurs. In captivity, they are just as willing to accept food during the day as at night.
When captured, they will strike readily and struggle vigorously in the hand. They may also perform a characteristic, stridulating threat display, in which counterlooped coils and the lower serrated, keeled scales are rubbed against one another to produce a loud hissing noise. However, captive specimens soon calm down and this behavior is lost.
Feeding.
Reported to be an opportunist, preying on amphibians, rodents and small birds.
Reproduction.
A gravid female specimen found in the Nyambeni range is reported to have given birth to 13 offspring in the month of August. Newborns measured 17-21 cm (6.7-8.3 inches) in total length.
Venom.
The Kenyan who collected the first specimens was bitten by an adult, with a single fang penetrating his right index finger. There was significant swelling and pain. A tourniquet was applied and an unknown antivenin was administered, after which the patient made a full recovery. It is doubtful, however, that the antivenin made any difference in this case, for no antivenin is known to be effective. Nevertheless, since these snakes are relatively large (for "Atheris") and their venom is known to contain powerful anticoagulants, a bite should be taken seriously. Poor coagulation may even require blood transfusions.

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina () is a Roman Catholic archdiocese comprising the southern part of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, as far north as the 30th township, or about 51°30' lat, that includes the suffragan dioceses of Prince Albert, and Saskatoon. It is currently led by Archbishop Daniel Joseph Bohan.
History.
In 188) in the Qu'Appelle valley, an Indian boarding school was founded by the Rev. Jos. Hugonard, O.M.I., who still directs it. Six trades are taught, in addition to the curriculum of the schools. The same Qu'Appelle valley was the cradle of the new diocese, Fort Qu'Appelle beings its only settlement until Father J.N. Ritchot established (1865) a mission at what is now Lebret. Then followed a few other missionary stations for the Indians, around which the development of the country consequent on a Government system of intense immigration has clustered the numerous centres of white population now extant, chief among which are Regina, the capital of the province, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, and Yorkton, the headquarters of a large Galician colony.
In 1911, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate founded the Diocese of Saint Regina. The Oblates were later joined by the Missionaries of La Salette and those of Issoudun, France, the Redemptorists, and the Sons of Mary Immaculate. Upon elevation, the name changed to the current Archdiocese of Regina.
As of 2004, the archdiocese contains 168 parishes, 83 active diocesan priests, 15 religious priests, and 120,000 Catholics. It also has 119 Women Religious, 21 Religious Brothers, and 3 permanent deacons. Its Cathedral, Holy Rosary in Regina, provides leadership in music and liturgy; there is a second "co-cathedral," Our Lady of Assumption Co-Cathedral, the former cathedral of the now-suppressed Diocese of Gravelbourg, which has been merged with the Archdiocese.
Clergy.
The regular clergy is represented by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the pioneers in the country, the Missionaries of La Salette and those of Issoudun, France, the Redemptorists, and the Sons of Mary Immaculate. Nuns of five different religious institutes either teach in the schools or serve the sick in the hospital at Regina. Besides its primary or parochial schools, there are five academies and three Indian boarding schools.
Demographics.
The Roman Catholic population amounts to 58,771, of whom 19,563 are of French descent, 16,318 Germans, about 13,000 Galicians following the Ruthenian Rite, 4759 English-speaking, 2312 Poles, and 1819 Hungarians. The rest are of various nationalities, and comprise about 1000 Roman Catholic First Nations individuals. Fifty-nine priests (43 French, 15 German and 1 British) attend to their spiritual needs.
Residential bishops.

James Edmond

James Edmond (21 April 1859 – 21 March 1933) was a Scottish-Australian journalist, notable as an editor of "The Bulletin".
Edmond was born in Glasgow, the son of James Edmond, carpet-maker, and his wife Janet, "née Dickson". As a child Edmond had only a primary education, but in later years he did much reading at the Glasgow public library. He went to work when he was 12 years old, and at 16 was a clerk in a fire insurance office. In 1878 he emigrated to New Zealand and followed various occupations with little success. In 1882 he went to Victoria and then to Queensland. At Rockhampton in 1885 he obtained a position as proof-reader on The Morning Bulletin, and began to send contributions to the Sydney "Bulletin". In 1886 J. F. Archibald invited him to join the staff and in 1890 he became associate-editor. 
Edmond took charge of the 'Wild-Cat' column in 1893, and, though he then had little knowledge of finance, quickly realized that in order to write about it intelligently, the necessary facts must be available. He collected balance sheets, and years afterwards began that comparison of the current year's figures with those of earlier years, which has since been so generally adopted in financial columns in Australia. He was also one of the first men to realize how dangerous over-borrowing abroad could be, and for a long period consistently fought against it in the columns of "The Bulletin". Edmond was more than a just writer on finance, he wrote humorous stories and sketches, leaders, dramatic criticism, paragraphs on all kinds of subjects and for some time a special column "The Brickbat slung by Titus Salt". In 1903 he became editor but still found time to do much writing.
Edmond was in many ways a good editor, but had little concept of how an editor's work might be delegated. This was bad for the training of the staff and, as was inevitable in the circumstances, Edmond's health broke down while he was still in his mid-fifties. Edmond was forced to retire in 1915. After four years' holiday he began to be a regular contributor again, but failing sight effectively prevented him from working during the last seven years of his life. After a courageous struggle with ill-health Edmond died at Sydney on 21 March 1933. His wife, a son, and three daughters survived him.
Of the large amount of Edmond's writings, very little has been collected. "A Policy for the Commonwealth", a reprint of a series of articles in "The Bulletin", appeared in 1900, and in 1913 "A Journalist and Two Bears", consisting mostly of humorous "Sketches from the Bulletin and the Lone Hand", was published. He had a great reputation as a humorist in his day which is now somewhat difficult to justify. He was associate-editor and editor of "The Bulletin" during the period when it was a power in the land, and did much in shaping its policy. He promoted Federation when it had little support in New South Wales, and his financial policy was generally sound. His strenuous writing against overseas borrowing had apparently little effect at the time, but the strong tendency in later years for governments to raise loans in Australia instead of overseas may have been largely a result of his work.

Bourbaki dangerous bend symbol

__NOTOC__
The dangerous bend or caution symbol ☡ () was created by the Nicolas Bourbaki group of mathematicians and appears in the margins of mathematics books written by the group. It resembles a road sign that indicates a "dangerous bend" in the road ahead, and is used to mark passages tricky on a first reading or with an especially difficult argument.
Others have used variations of the symbol in their textbooks, and computer scientist Donald Knuth introduced an American-style road-sign depiction in his Metafont and TeX systems, with a pair of adjacent signs indicating doubly dangerous passages.
Typography.
In the LaTeX typesetting system, Knuth's dangerous bend symbol can be produced by

Digenite

Digenite is a copper sulfide mineral with formula: Cu9S5. Digenite is a black to dark blue opaque mineral that crystallizes with a trigonal - hexagonal scalenohedral structure. In habit it is usually massive, but does often show pseudo-cubic forms. It has poor to indistinct cleavage and a brittle fracture. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and a specific gravity of 5.6. It is found in copper sulfide deposits of both primary and supergene occurrences. It is typically associated with and often intergrown with chalcocite, covellite, djurleite, bornite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. The type locality is Sangerhausen, Thuringia, Germany, in copper slate deposits.
Occurrence.
Digenite occurs in the transitional zone of supergene oxidation of primary sulfide ore deposits, at the interface between the upper and lower saprolite ore zones. It is rarely an important mineral for copper ores, as it is more usually replaced by chalcocite further up in the weathering profile, and is a minor weathering product of primary chalcopyrite. Natural digenite always contains a small amount of iron and is considered to be stable only in the Cu-Fe-S system.
In the Deflector and Deflector West Cu-Au lode deposits of the Gullewa Greenstone Belt, Western Australia, digenite is an important constituent of the transitional Cu-Au ore. However, it is difficult to treat metallurgically and remains a refractory ore type. In this locality digenite is found with covellite, chalcocite and bornite. 
It was first described in 1844 from the type locality of Sangerhausen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The name is from the Greek "digenus" meaning of two origins in reference to its close resemblance with chalcocite and covellite.
Polymorphs of Digenite.
There are three polymorphs of digenite, high, metastable and low. There is a complete solid solution series between high digenite and berzelianite Cu2-xSe (x~0.12).
High digenite is stable above 73 °C, with space group Fmm and unit cell parameters a=5.57 Å and Z=1 for formula Cu7.2-xS4. High digenite is isostructural with bornite Cu5FeS4.
Metastable digenite forms on cooling from 73 °C. It appears to be isometric with space group Fdm and a=27.85 Å. This symmetry, however, is due to twinning of fine domains with rhombohedral symmetry, trigonal -3m, point group R-3m, a = 3.92 Å, c = 48 Å, Z =15 for formula Cu1.8S. Metastable digenite changes with time to stable low temperature digenite or a mixture of anilite Cu7S4 and djurleite Cu31S16.
Low digenite is isometric, space group Fdm and a=27.85 Å, i.e. the same as the apparent isometric symmetry of the metastable polymorph, Z=4 for formula Cu1.8S.

Binz

Binz is the largest seaside resort on the German island of Rügen.
It is situated between the bay of Prorer Wiek and the "Schmachter See" (a lake) in the southeast of the island. To the north of Binz stretches the Schmale Heide (the "narrow heath"), a tongue of land which joins the Muttland region of Rügen to the Jasmund peninsula. The land to the south and east of Binz is hilly, reaching a height of over 100 metres above sea level.
Binz is famous for its charming and well-kept historical resort architecture and the natural scenery, close the Jasmund National Park and its chalk cliffs.
Geography.
Location.
Binz lies on the eastern coast of the island of Rügen between the bay of Prorer Wiek and the lake of Schmachter See. North of Binz is the Schmale Heide, a neck of land that links the Muttland – Rügen's central region – with the peninsula of Jasmund. East and south of the municipality, the land is rolling, in the southeast, in the Granitz, the land climbs to just over . The resort of Prora belongs to Binz.
History.
Fishing and farming village.
In 1318 the places was mentioned for the first time, as "Byntze ", in a tax collection document for the County of Streu ("Grafschaft Streu"). The heart of the settlement was the middle of the present "Bahnhofstraße" and "Rabenstraße". In addition there were the farmsteads of Granitz-Hof and Aalbeck. The church village and centre of the parish was Zirkow.
A first sign of its subsequent importance as a Baltic Sea resort arose as early as around 1830, when guests of the Prince of Putbus bathed at the mouth of the "Ahlbeck" (the outflow of the Schmachter See). In 1835 a one-classroom school was established. Around 1850 Binz farmers purchased the land hitherto rented to them by the Prince of Putbus.
Until 1326 the village was part of the Principality of Rügen and thereafter of the Duchy of Pomerania. With the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 Rügen, and hence Binz, became part of Swedish Pomerania. In 1815 Binz became part of New Western Pomerania within the Prussian Province of Pomerania.
From 1818 to 4 September 2011 Binz belonged, apart from a short interruption (1952–1955 Kreis Putbus) to the county of Rügen.
Development as a Baltic Sea resort.
Around 1875, bathing in the sea came into vogue. The first guests arrived in the small town of Binz, took a liking to it, and recommended it to others. That same year the first road was built connecting the village to the beach ("Putbuser Straße"). Ten years later, Binz officially became a bathing resort, which meant that building took off: the beach promenade, the pier, the spa house ("Kurhaus"), a new network of paths and a narrow-gauge railway connection were built. Around 1870, 80 bathers were counted in one year. No large hotels were built in Binz and other resorts on the Baltic coast in the late 19th century; instead lodging houses in a villa style were built in a style known as resort architecture They were given names associated with the "Zeitgeist": nationalistic names like "Germania" or names of family members – often the first name of the wife of the builder. In 1876, the first hotel was built. In 1880, Wilhelm Klünder had the first hotel near the beach built: the appropriately named "Strandhotel".
In 1888 die Binz Baltic Sea Resort Company ("Aktiengesellschaft Ostseebad Binz") was founded, which in 1890 opened the first spa house, the "Kurhaus Binz" and went bust in 1891. In 1892 Binz was elevated to the status of an independent rural municipality.
Around 1896, the "Bräunlich" shipping company linked the settlements of Stettin, Binz and Sassnitz with one other. This was followed by a building boom. In 1893 the first spa house and the "Kaiserhof" were built. In 1895, the construction of the Rügen Light Railway from Putbus to Binz followed, as well as the opening of the beach promenade. In 1898, the first post office was built ("Haus Kliesow, Hauptstraße"). On the beach separate swimming pools were created for men and women. In 1902, a 600-metre-long pier was built. Other infrastructure projects included the construction of a drinking water supply and sanitation (1903) and the a power station ("Jasmunder Straße").
Two setbacks were the destruction of the pier by a storm on New Year's Eve in 1905 and the burning down of the spa house in 1906. After the reconstruction of the pier in 1908, a new spa house was built. At the same time a family swimming pool was created. In 1912 a section of the pier collapsed, killing 17 people. Then in 1913 in Leipzig, the German Lifeguard Association was established.
In 1913 the Evangelical church was consecrated and, in 1928, the new post office building opened ("Zeppelinstraße"). Gradually the bathing areas on the beach were closed. In 1922 the men's swimming pool was demolished and finally, in 1932, the family swimming pool followed suit.
Nazi era.
In 1937 the construction of the KdF ("Strength Through Joy") resort at Prora began. It was planned to be Europe's largest seaside resort. The standard gauge Ostseebad Binz railway station was constructed in 1938, and the line from Binz to the junction at Lietzow was opened in 1939. During the winter of 1942 the pier was again destroyed, this time by ice.
GDR era.
In 1950, the construction of the Prora complex was completed, and the buildings were used as barracks for the Volkspolizei (People's Police). Later, they were used to house the Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army). The railway line between Binz and Lietzow was re-opened in 1952.
In 1953, the government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in which Binz was then situated, initiated "Action Rose". This was the name of the programme under which privately owned hotels, and guest houses were taken into social ownership. These businesses were transferred to the FDGB (the federal body of the East German trade unions), and included in their program of cheap holidays for union members.
After 1972, more holiday centres were built for the FDGB. Between the 1950s and 1985 estates of flats typical of the DDR ("Plattenbau") were built both to the north and west of the town.
Post-1990.
Following the reunification of Germany, Binz has undergone substantial change. Many of the villas were returned to their previous owners, and the town was restored and modernised. The former FDGB holiday centres were privatised and renovated. In 1994, a new pier, 370 metres long, was opened.
Points of interest.
Apart from the numerous early 20th-century hotels and villas in the town centre and along the seaside promenade, its main attractions are its 370-metre-long pier, the mid-19th-century Granitz Hunting Lodge and the enormous Prora complex just north of the town.
Economy and infrastructure.
Ostseebad Binz railway station stands at the end of the standard gauge Deutsche Bahn railway line from Stralsund via Bergen auf Rügen. Binz is also linked to the nearby towns of Putbus, Sellin, Baabe and Göhren by the narrow gauge steam railway the Rügensche Bäderbahn, known locally as Rasender Roland.

Serbia national under-21 football team

The Serbia national under-21 football team () is the national under-21 football team of Serbia and is controlled by the Football Association of Serbia.
This team is for Serbian players aged 21 or under at the start of a two-year UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship campaign, so players can be, and often are, up to 23 years old. Also in existence are teams for Under-20s (for non-UEFA tournaments), Under-19s and Under 17s. As long as they are eligible, players can play at any level, making it possible to play for the U21s, senior side and again for the U21s, as Matija Nastasić, Filip Đuričić, Lazar Marković, and Aleksandar Mitrović have done recently. It is also possible to play for one country at youth level and another at senior level (providing the player is eligible). Nikola Drinčić is a currently Montenegrin international and former Serbia U21 player.
History.
The Yugoslav U21 team represented Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until the country dissolved in 1992. In 1996 an under-21 team representing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began playing. The FR Yugoslavia (and the team) changed name to Serbia and Montenegro in 2003.
In 2006 Serbia and Montenegro separated, with its governing body converting into the Football Association of Serbia. The Serbian under-21 team has assumed Serbia and Montenegro's place in the qualifying round for the UEFA U-21 Championship 2007, whilst Montenegro was not able to compete internationally at U21 level until a Montenegrin FA was established.
Competition history.
As FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro.
The senior team played its first match in December 1994. The U21s' first competitive matches were in the qualification stage of the 1998 competition.
The under-21 team failed to qualify for the first three UEFA Under-21 competitions it entered, but were runners-up in the 2004 tournament. In their final championship, taking place in Portugal, Serbia and Montenegro qualified for semifinals, where they lost on penalties to Ukraine.
For the period prior to 1992, please see the Yugoslavia national under-21 football team.
As Serbia.
Serbia's under-21 national team qualified for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands, in June 2007, after a remarkable two game play-off against Sweden. After a shocking 3–0 loss at home, Serbia overturned the result two weeks later, defeating Sweden 5–0, and advancing to the final tournament. Serbia's 2007 U21 Championship campaign was very successful, as they finished in second place, losing the final to the hosts, by a score of 4–1. On their way to the final, they defeated Italy (1–0), Czech Republic (1–0) and Belgium (2–0).

<doc id="5955405" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5955405" title="Bag face">
Bag face

A Bag face is the front panel of a bag woven by various nomadic tribes of the Middle East and Central Asia for utilitarian and decorative purposes.
The nomadic tribes of the Middle East and Central Asia are perhaps more known for the hand knotted carpets and hand woven kilims (flatwoven textiles) that they made. These tribes include but are not limited to the Belouch, the Turkmen, the Afshars, the Bakhtyari, the Qashqai, the Kurds and many others. The bags that they wove were done in the same techniques as the larger rugs they also made. The most common technique is hand-knotted pile, but many tribal bags were also done in the various flat woven techniques including plain weave (kilim weave), soumac technique and other less common techniques.
These bags were used for various purposes. Often they were used for transporting goods while on migration. They also served as storage containers to be used in the tent or yurt. There are also specialized bags such as bags for carrying mirrors, bags for carrying the Qur'an, bags for carrying tent stakes and more. Often the bags are known by specific names based on the function they served. Some common bag names are "cuval" (camel bag), "khorjin" (double-sided donkey bags) and "mafrash" (bedding bag) to name just a few.
Often, the back panel of a bag will have little or no design. Generally on bags with knotted pile faces, the back of the bag will be executed in a plain woven kilim technique.
From the collectors point of view, the front or the "face" of the bag is much more interesting and more collectible. Often, with antique bags, the backs of the bag have been separated and discarded at some point and only the bagface remains.
Although there are still some tribal weavers weaving nice bags, it is the antique bags and bag faces that are the most prized and the most collected.

Texas State Highway 105

State Highway 105, or SH 105, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that runs from Brenham to the outskirts of Beaumont. The route was originally proposed in 1933 and took its current routing in 1984.
Route description.
SH 105 begins as a pair of one-way roads at an intersection with Business U.S. Route 290 in downtown Brenham. It then progresses northeast out of Brenham through mainly farming lands. It passes near Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas, which is the birthplace of Texas as the location of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence. It then crosses the Brazos River before passing through Navasota. The route briefly joins SH 6 before proceeding east again. It passes near Lake Conroe before entering the city of Conroe and an intersection with Interstate 45. The route continues east, passing through the very southern edge of Sam Houston National Forest before reaching Cleveland and an intersection with Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59. The route continues east out of Cleveland, briefly coinciding with SH 321, passing through a large section of East Texas Piney Woods, before reaching its eastern terminus at U.S. Routes 69, 96, and 287 on the far northern edge of Beaumont.
Route history.
The highway was originally proposed in 1926 from Navasota east through Conroe to Cleveland, roughly paralleling a local railroad line. By 1933 the route was completed as an earthen road, with a proposed extension east to Moss Hill. By 1939, a new section of SH 105 was under construction, being built westward from Beaumont, replacing SH 133. Construction was sporadic, with the section between Conroe and Beaumont not completed until the 1960s. In 1973, SH 105 was extended southwest into Brenham, replacing a section of SH 90. The current route was set in 1984 with the highway replacing FM 162 and shortening the route from Cleveland to Beaumont. One portion of FM 162 was originally designated as FM 1935. In 2005, a new routing around Cleveland was approved for construction, while the section through Cleveland will be designated as a business route of 105: 105-T.
Business routes.
SH 105 has one business route.
Business State Highway 105-T is a future Business Loop that will run on the current routing of SH 105 through Cleveland in central Texas. The road was designated in 2005, but was awaiting completion of the bypass routing of the main highway south of Cleveland as of 2008.

Ahmad Khansari

Haj Seyyed Ahmad Khansari, son of Seyyed Yusef Khansari, was one of the conspicuous jurisprudents. 
He was born in a religious family in Khansar City on 18th Moharam 1309 (AH). He studied Mathematics, Primary Sciences and Seminary lectures in Khansar. To continue his studies he went to Isfahan. His teachers were his great brother "Ayatollah Seyyed Hasan Khansari", Seyyed Mohammad Sadiq Isfahani, Mullah Abdul Karim Gazi, and Mirza Mohammad Ali Toyserkani. He was an expert in Medicine, physics, algebra, geometry, astronomy, philosophy, law, metaphysics and metascience (olome gharibe). After establishment of Qom Seminary by Ayatollah Haeri, according to his invitation, Haj Seyyed Ahmad Khansari left Isfahan for Qom to teach in the Seminary there. While there, he was considered as a high degree teacher. In Qom Seminary, he taught Theology, Philosophy and Mathematics. Only some of his students, such as Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, had the opportunity to learn about explicit sciences mentioned above, and the majority of his students studied jurisprudence in his public lectures. In 1370 (AH), When Haj Yahya Sajadi died, he went to Tehran according to Ayatollah Boroujerdi's request. In Tehran, he stayed in Sayyed Azizulallah Mosque. 
He has a book titled “Jame’ol Madarek fy sharhe mokhtasare nafee” in 14 volumes written in Arabic. The most prominent aspect of this book is its association with the new look of Shiat at playing chess. When Ayatollah Khomeini gave Fatwa on the freedom for playing chess, there was an outrage of contradictory ideas among Shiat jurisprudents, based on more than 1000 years history of chess prohibition. Ayatollah Khomeini referred to Jame’ol Madarek for his Fatwa, and chess was considered sound (Halal) to play after more than 1000 years among Shiat Muslims. There are other books claimed to be written by Ayatollah Haj Seyyed Ahmad Khansari; however, these were published after his death against his will. Therefore, some believe that these books have been modified from their original versions. 
He entered in 1342 events along with other jurisprudents. He was injured by police and security officers during a demonstration in Tehran Bazaar. After Ayatollah Boroujerdi's death, many Muslims of Iran and other countries referred to him and selected him as their religious leader. His scientific popularity was clear for every one and Najaf jurisprudents respected him.

Wooldridge Park, also known as Wooldridge Square, is a park in Austin, Texas, United States. It is one of the four original public squares incorporated into Downtown Austin through the 1839 city master plan drawn up by Edwin Waller. This area was designated as a public square on original 1839 plat of City of Austin, but lay vacant for 70 years. 
In an era of civic pride in 1909, however, Austin Mayor A. P. Wooldridge sponsored the cleaning of the square and the construction of a classical revival style gazebo for public engagements, and it officially opened the same year. The park was dedicated on June 18, 1909 to considerable aplomb with dedicatory address being made by the Mayor. Mayor Wooldridge was instrumental in organizing the city's first public school system, in bringing the Austin & Northwestern Railroad here, and in building the first dam on the Colorado River within the city limits. 
Wooldridge Park is unique as the only public square in Austin to have retained its original function since its establishment more than one hundred thirty years ago. When the first city plans were drawn in 1840, four such squares were included. The other three underwent various uses over time, hosting parking lots, a fire station, a church, a museum, and businesses. Wooldridge Park alone has remained an essential element of Austin's outdoor social, musical, and political life. 
Wooldridge Park consists of a city block, a natural basin whose sides are sloped inward to form an amphitheater. In its center is a bandstand. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

Andrew McKim incident.
On June 5, 2014, U.S. District Judge Gordon Quist ruled against Miller for a hit from behind during an October 31, 2000 Swiss league game that ended Andrew McKim's career. After the collision, McKim's cognitive skills were bad enough that he couldn't recall if he had any children. McKim was hospitalized for weeks with a concussion and a sprain of the cervical spine and never returned to the ice. Miller was charged and convicted of simple bodily harm, intentional bodily harm and gross negligence in Switzerland's Canton of Zürich in 2004.

Battle Hunter

Battle Hunter, known in Japan as and in Europe as The Hunter, is an anime-styled tactical role-playing game, released for the PlayStation in 1999. It was released in Japan as part of the SuperLite 1500 series of budget games. The game revolves around a player-controlled hunter that must compete with three other hunters in order to win a relic, and makes heavy use of traditional RPG conventions such as dice and tile-based movement.
Story.
In the years after a major world war, the few scientists remaining on Earth set out to develop a formula to protect humanity from extinction. To be successful they require vital information from the ruins of cities around the world, and assign the task of collecting it to an elite task force known as the Hunters. The story revolves around the player getting jobs from the shop owner to recover relics of interest from dungeons. Eventually the player will compete against a secret organization known as B PHS for the target relics.
Gameplay.
Gameplay centers around hunting and retrieving relics in a dungeon represented by a randomly generated grid. Four hunters are always present in the dungeon, with the computer controlling any hunters that are not controlled by the players. Before entering a dungeon, the player(s) are given a mission to retrieve a key relic hidden in one of the treasure boxes in the dungeon. Other treasure boxes contain other relics, but only the key relic is required to win any one mission. 
The player has 3 options : moving, attacking and resting (which will give him/her 2 cards and quarter of his/her Hit Points back).
Character development.
When creating a hunter, players are given 11 initial ability points to spend on Movement, Attack, Defense, and Hit Points. Raising stats uses the following system:
Cards.
Each hunter begins the game with 5 cards drawn randomly out of a deck of 100. Other players are always able to see each other's hands at all times. Cards can be used at different times throughout the game for different effects, but they are color-coded to the types of effects they cause. Blue and Yellow cards can be used on the map or in combat, but Red and Green cards can only be used in combat or on the map, respectively.
Blue cards affect movement ability. They range from +1 to +3 and E. There are only 2 blue E cards in the deck. When used on the dungeon grid map, blue cards increase the hunter's movement range for that round. If the an E card is used, it will warp the hunter directly to the exit. When used in combat, they increase the hunter's ability to escape from battle for one round. If an E card is used in combat, it will result in definite success in escaping.
Yellow cards affect defense and evasion. They range in value from +3 to +9, as well as A, and D. If used on the dungeon grid map, the cards increase the hunter's ability to avoid traps by a percentage of the card's value x10. For example, a yellow +3 will grant a 30% chance of evading a trap. Both D and A cards will grant total trap protection, increasing the rate to 100%. Cards only last for the round in which they are used, then they expire. If used in combat, they increase the hunter's defense by the amount on the card. a D card will double the hunter's defense, and an A card will maximize the defense.
Red cards affect attack. They can only be used in combat. Values on red cards range from +3 to +9, as well as C, and S. The C Card gives an attack bonus equal to the amount of the opponent's attack stat. The S card doubles your own attack stat. Just like there is only one each of the A and D Defense Cards, there is only one each of the C and S cards too.
Green cards represent traps and can only be used on the dungeon grid map. The traps are placed before the hunter moves, and remains in the space the hunter just vacated. Traps are not visible on the grid until they are stepped on and triggered by a hunter. There are 4 types of green card, each representing a different kind of trap. The maximum amount of traps on 1 space is 3 traps
Combat.
Combat can take place between two hunters or a hunter and a monster. Combat in Battle Hunter is different from most RPGs because combat ends after one exchange of actions, as opposed to fighting to the death. The majority of combat sessions end with both combatants still standing. If a character is afflicted with the Panic status effect, the computer automatically controls the panicked player's actions. If a character is stunned, they are not able to act at all, and have a defense stat of 0 if they are attacked in that state.
When attacked, the hunter that is being attacked can choose whether to counterattack, defend, run away, or surrender, assuming that they are not stunned. After choosing any action (other than surrender) the hunter will then choose a card to use, or use none if desired. Then, the attacking combatant will choose his/her card. The system will roll two 6-sided dice for each combatant: two for the attacker's attack strength, and two for the defender's defense strength. Each hunter's modifiers will be applied and damage will be resolved.
"Example: Hunter A attacks Hunter B. Hunter A has 3 attack and 0 defense, Hunter B has 1 attack and 2 defense. Hunter B chooses to counterattack and uses a +5 yellow Defense modifier. Hunter A chooses to use a +3 red Attack modifier. The system then rolls a 6 and a 5 for Hunter A, and a 4 and a 4 for Hunter B. Hunter A's attack is 6+5 +3 bonus +3 = 17. Hunter B's defense is 4+4 +5 bonus +2 = 15. Hunter B will take 2 damage. The system will then calculate Hunter B's counter-attack in a similar fashion."
If Defend is chosen, the defender makes no counterattack roll, but the character's defense stat is doubled when considering damage taken. In the case of the above example, if Hunter B defended, they would have taken 0 damage.
If Escape is chosen, the defender makes an escape roll. The defender can use any blue movement cards to aid in their chance to escape, and the attacker can use them to aid in their chance of catching the defender. Both players roll two diсe, and add their move bonus and the effects of any blue cards used to their totals. If the defender rolls a higher total score, they escape. If the attacker rolls a higher total score, then they catch the defender, and are allowed to make an attack. If this happens, the caught character's defense stat is 0 for the duration of damage calculation.
If Surrender is chosen, the defender gives up an item and is warped to a random spot on the map, just as if they were killed. However, the differences between this and actually dying are that if one surrenders, they get to choose what item they give to their attacker, and do not lose half of their max HP.
If a hunter loses all HP in a battle, he/she is not killed. Instead, the hunter is warped to a random location in the dungeon and his/her maximum HP is reduced by 50%. The hunter will allow the attacker to choose an item to take from their inventory, if it is another player. If GON, the monster that appears when there are no cards left in the deck, defeats the character with the Key Relic, the mission ends and all hunters lose all credits and any relics in their possession.
Relics.
After completing a dungeon, the player can ask the shop keeper to examine the relics he has found. Some of them are useless (like the empty bottle), but some others have effects, such as weapons which increase the hunter's Attack, or disks which contain wallpapers for the main menu. Some others give a handicap to the hunter who possess it, such as becoming confused at the end of your turn. Those can be used to escape a fight by giving it to the enemy which will be handicapped. Only relics which give a malus are effective when not examined, you need to examine the others to profit from their bonuses. You can also sell the relics to the shop keeper, whether they are examined or not. The Key Relic can not be examined : it is automatically sold.
Leveling up.
To level up, you have to gather enough money (credits) by selling relics or winning dungeons. Then, you can go to the clinic to buy your level up. When leveling up, your Hit Points automatically increase by 1, and you can add 1 point to the statistic of your choice. Maximum level is 15.
Deck running out of cards.
If the deck runs out of cards (which usually does not occur), then GON, the dungeon beast, is sent out. He is considered a monster (as he does not attack monsters but attacks hunters) and is very hard to beat. This wolf-like creature has an incredibly high attack and can take some hunters out in one hit. Beware not to let the deck get down to 0 cards!

Walter Patterson

Walter Patterson (1735 or 1742 - 6 September 1798) was the first British colonial Governor of Prince Edward Island.
Birth and life in the military.
The son of William Patterson of Foxhall, near Ramelton, County Donegal, and Elizabeth, daughter of William Thornton Todd of Buncrana Castle, Co. Antrim. He was a first cousin of Isaac Todd. Patterson joined the British Army early in life, participating in the Seven Years' War with the 80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot. He was soon appointed to the rank of Captain.
Governor.
In 1763, Prince Edward Island (then known as St. John's Island) was ceded to the British by the French, and it became a British colony. 
In 1764, Patterson requested grants to own land on the island, and he and his brother, John Patterson (father of future US Naval hero Commodore Daniel Patterson), were awarded Lot 19, near the present-day town of Kensington, through the 1767 land lottery. 
On 30 May 1769, the British Privy Council declared St. John's Island a colony with its own government, separating it from Nova Scotia. Patterson was appointed the island's first Governor on 19 July 1769 and arrived on the island on 30 August 1770.
Soon after taking the Oath of Office in September 1770, Patterson had already formed an Executive Council, and one of his and the council's first ordinances was to enforce the payment of Quit-Rent.
Following the first Assembly elections in 1773, Patterson acquired over of land from proprietors who had failed to pay their quit-rent. The land was to be sold off. The former proprietors wrote to the British government asking that their land be returned, and when this failed, they asked that Patterson be removed from office. This was to the first of several incidents which would cause tension between the British government and Governor Patterson. 
Soon after the petitions were sorted through in England, the Secretary of State from the British government wrote to Patterson, on 24 July 1783, ordering him to present a bill to the Assembly, one which Patterson was told he had to support. The bill was for the annulment of the land sales. Going against the British government, Patterson opposed the bill and managed to receive a majority from the Executive Council, supporting his decision. 
The British government retaliated by removing Walter Patterson from office, on 17 June 1786. He officially left office on 4 November.
In 1789, Patterson returned to England where he died nine years later.
The issue of absentee landowners and quit-rent in Prince Edward Island would not be resolved untl the passage of the Land Purchase Act in 1875.
Spouse.
Walter Patterson was married to Hester Warren in 1770. Unhappy on St. John's Island, she returned to England in 1771. They had two children, John and Charlotte. Walter Patterson's had two additional children on St. John's Island with companion Margaret Hyde. The Hyde family (Thomas Hyde, his two sons and four daughters) arrived in Canada from England in 1770, on the same boat as Governor Patterson.

Elzhi

Jason Powers better known as Elzhi is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. Known to many Underground fans as "Detroit's Best Kept Secret", he is a former member of Slum Village and now records as a solo artist. He is known for his complicated rhyme schemes, many of which contain polysyllabic ‘patterns’, internal rhymes and alliteration, evocative imagery, simile and metaphor. On May 10, 2011, Elzhi released his highly anticipated mixtape "Elmatic" as a tribute to Nas’ classic debut "Illmatic". Produced by Will Sessions, the mixtape has received glowing reviews from critics and fans alike. In his youth, he made numerous visits to the Hip-Hop shop in Detroit, taking advantage of open-mic nights hosted by fellow Detroit rapper Proof. These sessions gave him the opportunity to be surrounded by Detroit's most talented MC's, such as Obie Trice, Magestik Legend, Finale, Invincible, Phat Kat, Guilty Simpson, Royce da 59, One Be Lo, J Dilla, Baatin, D12, and even Eminem during his battling days.
Biography.
Out of Focus.
In 1998, Elzhi recorded a number of songs with Detroit hip-hop artist DJ Houseshoes with DJ Rios. These recording sessions yielded material that would become the "Out of Focus EP", but the project was abandoned due to personal obligations and a lack of distribution options in Detroit. During the mixing process, DJ Houseshoes passed the DATs onto Dilla, who intended on remixing the whole album before his passing.
In late 2000, Elzhi acquired Dilla's master tapes and provided his close friends with CD's of the "Out of Focus EP", plus 3 extra tracks. With a few CD's out in the open, the EP eventually leaked onto the Internet under the name "Unreleased Solo Project", but many CD's sold or distributed under this title are mislabeled with inaccurate track-listings and credits. The project was re-released in 2011 on his official website with a 27-minute bonus track showcasing verses from past features.
925, Waajeed, and Jay Dee.
In 1999, Elzhi became affiliated with the 9-2-5 Colony, a group formed by Nick Speed and Magestik Legend. The trio of emcees recorded only a few songs together: "Gun Talk", "Oh Shit" and "Farewell". In "Farewell", produced by Lacks, each emcee spits a verse about their relationships with women. Elzhi uses a verse he had originally recorded for the DJ Houseshoes-produced "What I Am", a discarded song from the "Out of Focus" sessions. "Farewell", like the rest of the 9-2-5 material, remains incomplete and unreleased.
In 2000, Elzhi began extensive collaboration with Waajeed, and the pair created an untold number of songs. "Stunted Growth" is one of the few tracks to ever emerge from this era of recording.
As Elzhi and Waajeed became closer, so did El's affiliation with Slum Village. Constantly working on his music, Elzhi had the opportunity to record songs over some of Jay Dee's unused beats (e.g. "Days and Nights Analyzin'" and "Concrete Eyes") and attracted the attention of Slum Village member T3, who took the young artist under his wing, bringing Elzhi to the attention of Jay Dee. This connection paved the way for Elzhi's national debut on Jay Dee's "Welcome to Detroit" album, for which he received his first ever pay check in the rap game. Elzhi's verse on the song "Come Get It" was acclaimed by Hiphopsite.com upon its release.
Slum Village.
In 2001, with Jay Dee no longer an official member, Slum Village began recording their follow up to "Fantastic, Vol. 2". During the sessions, T3 invited Elzhi to collaborate on a few tracks. One of the earliest of these was the "Aerodynamic Remix" by Daft Punk, which was featured on the "Kiss of the Dragon" soundtrack. Originally, Slum Village intended Elzhi's presence on the album to be nothing more than a featured guest. But, recognizing their chemistry, Baatin and T3 invited Elzhi to become a full-time member, a choice enthusiastically supported by J Dilla. In July 2010, Elzhi officially announced his departure from Slum Village at the advice of his manager the J.B. Group.
Libido Sounds and the Future.
In 2004, Elzhi and Nick Speed formed the Libido Sounds label in order to release "Witness My Growth", a double CD compilation of Elzhi's unreleased solo material from as early as 1997. The double disc includes exclusive J Dilla collaborations, as well as highlights from the "Out of Focus EP". Production credits on the mixtape include J Dilla, Waajeed, Karriem Riggins, Page Kennedy, B.R. Gunna, DJ Magnetic, Houseshoes and The Alchemist.
His first solo project with national distribution, "The Preface", was released on August 12, 2008.
eLmatic.
On May 10, 2011, Elzhi released a mixtape as an homage to Nas's debut album Illmatic, with Will Sessions recreating the sounds of the iconic album. The mixtape was greatly received by hip hop fans and considered one of the best projects released in 2011. He has released three videos for the mixtape, "Halftime", "Memory Lane", and "It Ain't Hard to Tell", which has hit 1 million views despite not being backed by a major record label.
The Weather Man.
In 2012 Elzhi announced on Twitter that his next album will be titled "The Weather Man" (re-titled from the previous announced title "The Feed"). The lead single from the album is ""Blue Widow"" and a music video has been released for the song. Elzhi reported that the album is to be released sometime in 2013. Elzhi was recently featured on Phonte's single ""Not Here Anymore"".

Nathan Currier

Nathan Currier (born 1960, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania) is an American composer.
Biography.
Coming from a musical family, composer Nathan Kind Currier is son of composer Marilyn Currier (1931) and brother of composer Sebastian Currier (1959).
His principal teachers were David Diamond, Joseph Schwantner, Bernard Rands, Stephen Albert and Frederic Rzewski. He studied at the Juilliard School, where he received the Doctorate in 1989, and also served on their Evening Division faculty over a ten year period.
Starting in 2007 he served for two years as a visiting faculty member at the McIntire Department of Music at the University of Virginia.
"Gaian Variations" interrupted premiere.
Nathan Currier's largest work is an oratorio called Gaian Variations. The premiere took place at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, on April 21, 2004, but was interrupted mid-concert, shortly after the beginning of the third act. The work is about the Gaia hypothesis, a scientific theory of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, now generally considered either closely aligned or synonymous with Earth System Science, one of the fastest growing fields in the sciences today due to its significance for understanding global climate. The composer described his work as both a description of the theory and a contextualization of it within the history of science, and he spent years writing the large work for chorus, orchestra and soloists. During the premiere the Brooklyn Philharmonic suddenly stopped, claiming that it was headed into overtime, ultimately triggering a lawsuit.
Leading American composer John Corigliano, also a board member of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, called Gaian Variations, “Just beautiful. Very, very skilled work, and very inspired too.” The New York Times, however, published a highly critical review by Allan Kozinn that began by claiming the work's texts (featuring writings by Lovelock himself, describing his Gaia theory) were “mostly pseudoscientific.”
Currier, who has since given talks on climate change for Al Gore’s The Climate Project, felt that the urgency of climate change gave the subject matter such importance that he had used his personal savings to prevent cancellation of the concert when neither the Brooklyn Philharmonic nor another environmental organization, Earth Day Network, raised the needed funds. Currier was given a pro bono lawyer through Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts shortly after the performance, but the Executive Vice President and Director of the Hess Oil Company, J. Barclay Collins II, also a client of the same firm (Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld) and Chairman of the Board of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, intervened, and Currier lost legal representation. On the New York Times's ArtsBeat blog, oil executive Collins (who retired from the petroleum company in January 2010) was quoted as saying that Currier’s lawsuit was “totally without merit.” It was not until 2008 that Currier again found legal support, being represented by Alex T. Roshuk, and the case was finally filed in Supreme Court of the State of New York Kings County in 2009. Currier was quoted shortly thereafter in the New York Post as saying that he only wanted the orchestra to play the work again.
Currier later became actively involved with Gaia science itself. With NASA scientist Paul D. Lowman he coauthored a chapter of the book "Chimeras and Consciousness", published by MIT Press in 2011. Their paper, "Life’s Tectonics", concerns Gaia and the role of life and water on plate tectonics, and when NASA recently celebrated the 50th Anniversary of its exobiology program ("Seeking Signs of Life", October 2010), a passage from their paper was condensed and read as part of the opening keynote speech given by Lynn Margulis.

Mary I, Countess of Menteith

Maire inghean Mhuireadhaich or Mary, daughter of Muireadhach II, Mormaer of Menteith, was Countess of Menteith, successor to her sister Isabella (Iosbail). She inherited the title from her father, and married Walter Bailloch, son of Walter Stewart, 3rd High Steward of Scotland. By the time of the death of Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, jure uxoris Earl of Menteith in 1258, she may have already been married. In 1260, Isabella was arrested (along with her new husband, an English knight called John Russell) for the poisoning of her late husband; by the month of April 1261, Walter and Mary were ruling the province as Count and Countess. 
She died before her husband, but the exact year is not known. Her husband may have been alive as late as 1294. She and he had two sons, Alexander, the next ruler of the province, and John, the famous betrayer of William Wallace.

OH 7

OH 7 (Olduvai Hominid № 7), also nicknamed "Johnny's Child", is the type specimen of "Homo habilis". The fossils were discovered on November 4, 1960 in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, by Jonathan and Mary Leakey. The remains are dated to approximately 1.75 million years, and consist of fragmented parts of a lower mandible (which still holds thirteen teeth, as well as unerupted wisdom teeth), an isolated maxillary molar, two parietal bones, and twenty-one finger, hand, and wrist bones.
The OH 7 hand is wide, with a large thumb and broad fingertips, similar to that of humans; however, unlike in humans the fingers are relatively long and exhibit chimpanzee-like curvature. Furthermore, the thumb's orientation relative to the other fingers resembles the anatomy of great apes. The parietal bones — a nearly complete left parietal and fragmented right parietal — were used to deduce the cranial capacity of the hominid, which was placed at 363 cc in account of the fact that the fossils belonged to a 12- or 13-year-old male. This was extrapolated by Phillip Tobias to 674 cc for the hominid's full adult potential. However, other scientists have estimated the cranial capacity at 590 cc to 710 cc.
Louis Leakey, John Napier, and Phillip Tobias were among the first to extensively study the fossils. The Leakey team and others argued that, due expanded cranial capacity, gnathic reduction, relatively small post-canine teeth (compared to "Paranthropus boisei"), "Homo"-like pattern of craniofacial development, and a precision grip in the hand fragments (which indicated the ability for tool use), set OH 7 apart as a transitional species between "Australopithecus africanus" and "Homo erectus".
The Leakey team announced the new species "Homo habilis" in the April 1964 issue of "Nature", igniting debate among the anthropology community which lasted through the 1970s. As early as May 1964, Kenneth Oakley and Bernard Campbell had raised concerns about the Leakey team's findings with their own publication in "Nature", and in July of that same year Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark bluntly stated his hope that "H. habilis" "will disappear as rapidly as he came." The controversy and bias against the newly named species lead some anthropologists to refer to "H. habilis" as "Australopithecus habilis" or assign associated fossil remains to other "Homo" species, a trend that continued long after Le Gros Clark's death in 1971. 
Other critics noted that OH 7 was found in a region known to contain "P. boisei" fossils, was of an immature individual, and that the differences between "H. habilis" and "P. boisei" were not enough to warrant a new species. Some believe OH 7 more closely resembles "A. africanus".

Gladbach Abbey

Gladbach Abbey was a Benedictine abbey founded in 974 by Archbishop Gero of Cologne and the monk Sandrad from Trier. It was named after the Gladbach, a narrow brook that now runs underground. The abbey and its adjoining villages grew into the town of Gladbach, incorporated in the 1360s, the origin of the present city of Mönchengladbach in North Rhine-Westphalia.
In 1802 the abbey was occupied by troops under the French occupation and secularised; its great library was dispersed. From 1805 to 1835 it was used as a textile mill.
In 1835 the city authorities acquired the main building to replace the old "Rathaus", which was demolished. This now constitutes the present Rathaus Abtei. The remaining monastic buildings were also acquired by the city one by one, for the accommodation of municipal offices.

Rodolfo Luat

Rodolfo Luat (born December 8, 1957) is a Filipino professional pool player from Angeles City, Pampanga. He is one of the higher-ranking players of Team Philippines and he holds many Asian individual, world Champion and team titles. Luat turned professional at age 16. He has titles in the Asian Championships and the Philippine Nine-ball Open in 1992. Winner of the 1996 World Open Nine-ball Championship, Luat has been regarded as a "dark horse" in many tournaments. 
"Boy Samson" is a moniker he has carried since the 1970s because of his powerful break. During the 2003 Asian Nine-ball Tour, Luat commented that he broke so hard one time that he made a crack on the cue ball.
Career.
He won the Taiwan leg of the 2006 WPA Asian Nine-ball Tour beating Hsia Hui-kai, 11-7, in the finals, on his very first try on the annual circuit. He also placed runner-up in the 2006 US Open held at Chesapeake, Virginia, losing to John Schmidt, 11-6, but winning US$15,000 in the process. He participated in the 2006 IPT North American Open held at Las Vegas, Nevada, reaching the fifth round with winnings of US$30,000. He also reached the third round of the rich 2006 IPT World Open held at Reno, Nevada, where he won US$11,100. He also finished runner-up at the 2006 Derby City Nine-ball Division (winning US$8,000), Bank Division (9th place, US$850) and One-pocket Division (18th place, US$500). Capping off the year was his quarterfinal finish at the 17th WPA World Nine-ball Championship held in Manila, Philippines, where he won US$10,000, becoming the second-best placed Filipino after eventual champion Ronato Alcano. 
Very skilled players in nine-ball have the tendency to sometimes pocket four or even five balls . Luat, at the 2005 APBU/JPBA Japan Open tournament held in Tokyo, sank "six" balls on the break, two-thirds of the entire rack. (But note that Alex Pagulayan also performed a similar feat at a tournament in the US.)
Luat, 50, won the $15,000 (P727,500) top prize of the Bacolod leg, of the First Senate President Manny Villar Cup, on November 16, 2008. At the Garden Royal Function Hall of Goldenfields Commercial Complex, Luat downed Ramil Gallego, 13-10 (who earned $5,000 or P242,500).
Personal life.
Luat and his wife have two children,Geraldine Luat and Richard Bryan Luat.

Gill Langley

Gillian Rose Langley (born 1952) is a British scientist and writer who specializes in alternatives to animal testing and animal rights. She was, from 1981 until 2009, the science director of the Dr Hadwen Trust, a medical research charity. She was a member of the British government's Animal Procedures Committee for eight years, and has worked as a consultant for the European Commission, and for animal protection organizations in Europe and the United States. 
Langley is the author of "Vegan Nutrition" (1988), and editor of "Animal Experimentation: The Consensus Changes" (1990). She has written a number of reports for the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments, including "Faith, Hope & Charity? An Enquiry into Charity-Funded Research" (1988), and "Next of Kin" (2006), an examination of primate experimentation.
Education.
Langley obtained an MA in physiology, cell biology, and zoology at the University of Cambridge, then gained her PhD in neurochemistry, also from Cambridge. She took up a position as a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, specializing in neurophysiology in cell culture.
Involvement in animal protection.
Langley was herself an animal researcher who decided to campaign professionally against animal experiments. She was a member of the Animal Procedures Committee for eight years, which advises the British Home Office on issues related to animal testing, and has acted as an advisor to the government on the introduction of the new European Union chemicals legislation, REACH. She has served as a specialist consultant for the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). She was called as an expert witness in 2001 by the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures during its inquiry into animal experimentation in the UK.
In April 2006, she was a member of the panel at the Oxford Union that debated whether "This house would not test on animals." Opposing the motion were Laurie Pycroft—who founded Pro-Test, which organized the debate—Sir Colin Blakemore, Professor John Stein, and Professor Lord Robert Winston. Supporting the motion, along with Langley, were Dr Andrew Knight, Uri Geller and BUAV campaigns director Alistair Currie. The motion was defeated by 273 to 48.
Position on animal research.
Langley is an anti-vivisectionist and vegan. She told "The Guardian" that she "would never claim that all animal experiments are without scientific value," but argues that what she sees as the scientific flaws in animal experimentation and the ethical case against it constitute a case for its immediate abolition. She also argues that the legislation supposed to protect the 2.7 million animals currently used each year in the UK is inadequate, and that more money should be invested in developing alternatives, such as in-vitro and clinical studies. She told the BBC: "When you know that other animals can feel pain and distress in the same ways that humans do, it is unethical to experiment on them." She argues that because the British government's budget for alternatives is subdivided into different areas, what each area receives is barely enough to fund one research project.
She is particularly opposed to the use of non-human primates in xenotransplantation, where pig organs are grafted onto the necks of primates to test anti-rejection drugs. She told medical journalists Jenny Bryan and John Clare that the primates used in xenotransplantation research are subjected to major surgery; internal haemorrhages; isolation in small cages; repeated blood sampling; wound infections; nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea because of immunosuppressant drugs; kidney or heart failure, and eventually death. She said: "It's not just the suffering they endure in the laboratories and research establishments. Just getting there can be torture. Studies of primates show them to have complex mental abilities which may increase their capacity to suffer. Supplying the laboratories in the UK imposes huge suffering on the animals... They're then contained in small, single cages, and transported for very long distances causing deaths, distress and suffering."
"Next of Kin".
Langley's report, "Next of Kin" (2006), was published simultaneously with the publication by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust in favor of primate experimentation. The "New Scientist" writes that her report cites studies suggesting that macaques and other small monkeys are more conscious of themselves and others than was previously believed, giving them a moral status equivalent to that of great apes, who are currently not used in experiments in the UK. David Morton, professor of Biomedical Science & Ethics at the University of Birmingham, said the report was "a wake-up call to scientists to raise their game in their justification and ways they use non-human primates in research."

Goodiepal

Goodiepal or Gæoudji SYGNOK, whose real name is Parl Kristian Bjørn Vester, is a controversial Faroese/ Danish musician/composer who might be best known for his two books: "Radical Computer Music & Fantastisk Medie Manipulation" and "El Camino Del Hardcore - Rejsen Til Nordens Indre". The self-made Goodiepal has influenced the course of modern music through radical excursions into computer technology and media art. He performs and lectures about his work and ideas worldwide and has by 2013 done so at about 150 universities around the world. From 2004 till 2008 he was the head of the electronic music department and a teacher at DIEM (Danish Institute for Electro-acoustic Music) at the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark. Goodiepal only travel the world by his home-made bike. " Kommunal klon Komputer 2, and makes his own electricity with dynamos, by doing so he claims this is real computer music. He lives nowhere in particular but pays his tax in Tórshavn.
1988-1992: The computer demo scene and a young hacker.
Goodiepal spent his childhood painting Citadel Miniatures and playing video games and role playing games before going to a Rudolf Steiner school where gadgets such as computers, calculators, walkmen, and Game & Watch games were prohibited. Goodiepal departed from the Steiner school after eight years and embarked on various activities with hacker groups in the grey area of computer software programming and distribution in order to provide for his musical career, by then already in full progress.
1992-1995: "Vip.ibex".
The first full-length CD "Vip. ibex" was released by the Danish record label Spoof Records in 1995 under the name Circulation of Events. Only a limited number of copies were distributed and the rest were deliberately hidden away in a basement in North Jutland County, Denmark, where they were kept in order to be rereleased ten years later on the date of pressing. Circulation of Events was a name used by Goodiepal but sometimes also by early mentors such as Odd Bjertnes and Halfdan Larsen. In 1993 Kim Grønborg and Goodiepal premiered the light concert Interelektrolux at Galleri Høgsberg in Århus, Denmark. The show consisted of two rooms with individually computer programmed light sources creating a one hour long concert running continuously for two weeks.
1996-1998: "Sincerely Christmas" and "Friends of The Goodiepal".
1996 saw Goodiepal produce the debut album "Knee" for infamous Danish (then teenage) rockband Düreforsög. The album consolidated the band's great talent and led to a performance as the opening act on the main Orange Stage at 1997's Roskilde Festival in Denmark. The notoriously shy Goodiepal operated the sound system from inside a five meter tall inflatable rubber chicken placed on top of the stage, an act rumoured to be a tribute to the legendary American band Cock E.S.P..In the following years, Goodiepal worked as a producer and programmer for a number of Danish artists and also released the single "Sincerely Christmas" on major label BMG Europe/RCA with Danish techno equilibrist Bjørn Svin. This release was seen as an act of black nihilism typical for Goodiepal and was generally hated at the time of its release. Nevertheless, in 2006 Danish artist and physicist Teppop claimed that the single was one of the most important releases he had listened to during his formative years. In 1998, Goodiepal hosted two extravagant shows called "Friends of The Goodiepal" at Den Anden Opera in Copenhagen, Denmark, presenting V/Vm, Anthony Manning, Thomas Brinkmann, Escaping From the Zoo and many other friends.
1997-2000: "Goodiebags" and "Demonbags".
Goodiepal's connection to V/Vm Test Records was established when the Manchester-based label released the two legendary 7"-series Goodiebags and Demonbags consisting of nine+nine singles. Programmers and sound artists such as Anthony Manning, Lucky Kitchen, V/Vm, Steuea, Per Hoier, Voks and Team Doyobi were featured on the 18 vinyls, which came with a secret "Codebreaker" manual sheet.The series were concluded in 2000 and Goodiepal immediately carried on with the new "Mainpal Inv. Brand-archive" consisting of a series of autonomously manipulated sound designs for a range of companies such as Sony, Nokia, Chupa Chups and Bang & Olufsen. Goodiepal is said to have been working for the Danish advertisement agency Danesadwork/Propaganda at the time as a creative consultant, fuelling rumours that the "Brand-archive" reclaimed material he had produced for these companies. Subsequent lawsuits supposedly had him kicked out of the business and despite the hype no one dared to employ the Goodiepal afterwards, so he started working as a home carer on the Faroe Islands as well as in Frederiksberg, Denmark. The "Brand-archive", dealing with matters such as authenticity, modification, folklore, and corporate companies, inspired a lot of other actors in and around the electronic music circles of the western world, and works such as the album "The Civil War (album)" by Matmos would probably not have existed without it. In between numerous releases, Goodiepal toured extensively all over the western world and in 2000 relocated to London becoming closely connected to the Italian duo Gamers In Exile and their record label Unbearable Recordings. Goodiepal/Mainpal appeared with some of the tracks from the "Goodiebag"/"Demonbag"-series on "Unbearable_Heroes Wave 2".
2001-2003: "Narc Beacon".
In 2001 the French label SKI-PP, run by DAT Politics, released Goodiepal's debut album "Narc Beacon" on CD, it was subsequently released on vinyl as well called "Nag Nag Bacon". The album was praised in several magazines as one of that year's best releases, and also listed among the most important 50 Danish records ever in the "Encyclopedia of Danish Rock Music" ("Dansk Rock Leksikon"). 
British music magazine The Wire wrote, "On the first few spins, the disc feels like a sonic translation of Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland". It's an immersive, disorientating trip that marries "Sgt Pepper-esque" chunks of psychedelic digitalia, jaunty folk jigs, children's TV jingles, baroque music box follies and indescribable sonic oddities." Right before the release of "Narc Beacon", Goodiepal proclaimed that he would take a break from releasing music and that his next major work would be a brick based compositional musical language. This would take the form of a game, which would deal more radically with computer music and later develop into the "Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra" compositional game scenario."Narc Beacon" was awarded an honourable mention at the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, in 2002, and the same year Goodiepal gave his first lectures in the USA, among other places at CalArts, Brown University, and University of Iowa. He also lectured with a broken leg and damaged arms at Princeton University, US, after throwing himself out from a balcony in east London, UK.
2004-2005: The mechanical bird and "Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra".
In 2004 Goodiepal premiered his self-built mechanical bird, which became a popular feature at numerous live events around Europe together with a set of planets and a wind-up music machine, the latter using punch cards of Goodiepal's own fabrication. Numerous mobile phone images and film clips can be found online from these shows and rumour has it that Goodiepal spent most of 2004 with his family on the Faroe Islands building these instruments and show gadgets. He further commissioned Anthony Manning and Pure to record special wake-up calls for the mechanical bird. 2004 also saw Goodiepal sell a huge library and sound archive called the "Hacker Pack" in an attempt to devalue recorded media. The content of the "Hacker Pack" was mainly what he described as "reclaimed sounds", in other words sounds that he had made for various jingles and advertisements a few years earlier. Due to the shady copyrights of the material, Goodiepal shipped most of the discs, which also included various software and data on conspiracy theories and UFO activities, from his home on the Faroe Islands. He went on to participate in the installation "Circus Pentium" by Danish artist Henrik Plenge Jakobsen opening at Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, Denmark, also in 2004. The work comprised a circus set-up with Goodiepal playing the lute alongside other actors and was also shown at Art Basel, Switzerland, and Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The spectacular installation generally got a negative response from art critics in Denmark while it was received to greater acclaim outside Scandinavia. The same year saw Goodiepal employed as a teacher in History and Aesthetics of Electronic Music at DIEM (Danish Institute of Electro-acoustic Music) The Royal Danish Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark, subsequently moving on to teach in Composition as well. In 2005 Goodiepal released an untitled double-12" coloured vinyl on V/Vm Test Records with the catalogue number VVMT24 containing a selection of iconic Goodiepal music such as the home-built music box, whistling, action packed trance plus not least the famous mechanical bird, including one of the wake-up calls as mentioned above. The release came in 100 copies with engravings in Goodiepal's significant style, which has also been a greatly admired feature on a number of other of his releases. Despite quickly selling out, the album was widely considered a failure not reaching the high level of "Narc Beacon", something Goodiepal dismissed as he regards it as one of his most interesting, dealing with the concepts of mechanics and presets. The release, as well as many other Goodiepal releases, is available for free download from V/Vm's Brainwashed website 2005 also saw the release of the live-album "Mort Aux Vaches" on the Dutch record label Staalplaat with relative international media attention to follow. In continuation of his dealings with the unsuccessful synthesizer manufacturer Key2Sound, working without any payment, Goodiepal decided to take action by hiding an unnamed piece of music in the system source code of a prototype called INetSynth. The prototype and source code were then brought up for auction offering the head of Key2Sound a veto-price of 10 Danish kroner, if he wanted his prototype back. Through this act, Goodiepal reclaimed a symbolic fee for the work he had done for Key2sound, and since they did not respond, the INetSynth, with tag, went to an unknown Dutch collector.In 2005, Goodiepal was commissioned by the Nordic Council of Ministers to create a sound piece representing Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and Greenland at the World Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan. The result was a generative computer music program playing Goodiepal music through countless speakers in three exhibition spaces in the exhibition's Nordic pavilion.
2007-2008: The autonomous London school.
In 2007, Goodiepal opened an autonomous school on the first floor of The Blue House in London, designed by FAT Architecture, for people interested in Radical Computer Music and other of his arts. The school, open from 9am to 10:10am every weekday, is free of charge and financed through his skillful work as a fixer of fine mechanics.The term Radical Computer Music was coined by Goodiepal in relation to the "Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra" compositional game scenario. It promotes an expanded dialogue between human beings and artificial and alternative intelligences as a way to transgress a condition of stagnation, according to Goodiepal prevailing in contemporary computer music and media art. The game scenario is an exercise in the creation of musical scores to challenge the mindset of "other" intelligences, considering issues such as utopia, time, notation techniques, language, levels of unscannability, and the role of the composer. In late 2007 Goodiepal made a famous appearance on the Danish late night talk show "Den 11. Time" (The 11th Hour), lecturing about his musical theories and the future of artificial intelligence. He was initially given a time slot of about 25 minutes, but exceeded that by far lecturing for over an hour. So the lecture was edited down to 15 minutes of highlights, to fit the program format, and made available in full length online.26th of July 2009--> "Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra" was launched as an educational program at a special lecture given in April 2008 at the 5th Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art, the work as such was first premiered in October 2007 at a solo exhibition at Andersen's Contemporary in Copenhagen, Denmark. At the opening, a collection of 45 individual bindings, holding nine musical objects for the Radical Computer Music game scenario, was brought up for sale. The boxes started at a low price, which went up significantly throughout the exhibition and a few remaining copies are supposedly still available from the Danish publisher Pork Salad Press. Throughout the exhibition, Goodiepal gave a number of lectures covering various fields in modern composition and computer music.On 27 October 2008, Goodiepal received a first class merit certificate, with distinction, from StoryTellerScotland being the only known existing proof of his qualifications. He is now officially allowed to call himself a "Master Storyteller" of the highest accord in the UK.
Towards the end of 2008, Goodiepal created what he considers an expert panel consisting of members with various skills and backgrounds such as Andreas Hauer-Jensen, Anders Jørgen Mogensen, Uglemads, Martha Hviid and Tordis Berstrand. He has since taken the panel around Europe to help him lecture and perform and during the trips told them most of the secrets behind the "Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra" game scenario and Radical Computer Music. Some of these ideas are also described in "Radical Computer Music & Fantastisk Mediemanipulation: A Corrected and Illustrated Transcript of the Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough" published in 2009.
2008-2011: "Five steps in a Gentleman's War on the stupidity of modern computer music and media based art".
When Goodiepal left The Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark, in 2008, he did not go quietly. The declaration "Five steps in a Gentleman's War on the stupidity of modern computer music and media based art" was released as a supplement to the audio piece "The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough" and the series of images called "Snappidaggs" [http://www.flickr.com/photos/32556543@N05/sets/72157609437204597 explaining the methodology behind Goodiepal's concept of Radical Computer Music. The following is a brief breakdown of Goodiepal's war declaration:
• "Round one: The terrifying truth" - Goodiepal set out to define his objectives against academia in general, and the Aarhus version in particular, at a special lecture given at The 5th Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art. He also released the audio piece "Future Shock" [http://brainwashed.com/vvm/downloads/gpal/various/goodiepal_future_shock_may_2008.mp3] - sometimes called "Black Heart for Scandinavia" - on heart-shaped vinyl. As predicted, his actions were met by silence from the opponents in Aarhus.
• "Round two: A possible solution for the future of computer music and media art in general" - With reference to "The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough" [http://i3hypermedia.com/audio/Alku69_MAVEE_Walkthrough.mp3] Goodiepal distributed his school books and solution to the crisis in computer music and media art, widely, using all means such as spamming, banner ads, and giving lectures across Europe. He was again met with silence, if not outright ridicule from his opponents.
• "Round three: The great debate" - Goodiepal carried on buying banner ads on selected internet sites as well as giving lectures. In December 2008 he bought four pages in the music magazine The Wire to prove his merits and capability of undertaking the work, he had set in motion. The opponents also carried on, laughing, including Professor John Deathridge, King's College in London, UK, who rejected Goodiepal's application for a Master degree on the basis of the autonomous and un-academic actions.
• "Round four: Claim your victory and collect your Danegæld" - On 13 April 2009, Goodiepal released a statement claiming that he possibly suffers from the neurological disorder Huntington's Chorea. This act was carried out as the final step in his war to – A: prove that not just his music but he himself is, if not unscannable, then very hard to scan; B: as a possible manifestation of Schrödinger's cat since Goodiepal has entered a sort of superposition; C: in deep respect of Andreas Hauer-Jensen, one of Goodiepal's closest friends and artistic side-kicks, who was hit by a car and upon the release of the statement was still in a coma.Goodiepal also for a while threatened the students and technical staff at the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus with the dreadful claim that if he was not paid some sort of Danegæld for his struggles, he would break into DIEM – the Danish Institute for Electroacoustic Music's studios at the academy and confiscate every single power cable for each computer available there. Perhaps as a consequence of that, Goodiepal was awarded a special one-of-a-kind medal at a small surprise ceremony on 15 September 2009 by professor Wayne Siegel, leader of DIEM. The medal was given in honour of Goodiepal's kamikaze strikes against the old and stubborn mindset of the academy, and it might or might not prove that he won his playful war game. It did however create quite a bit of debate since most people in charge at DIEM and the old fashioned Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus would, and still to this date will, not accept the medal as an official gesture. So, Round 4 in Goodiepal's "Gentleman's War" is therefore potentially not yet won. No matter what, he did leave the room stating that it takes much more than a piece of plastic to shut him down! On the 31st of October 2009, after a concert/lecture at Starr Space in Brooklyn, New York, Goodiepal was awarded the honorary "7 Secret Golden Keys to Bushwick" by The Stiff Left Arm of Brooklyn / the people of 340 south 5th street. The award was given as an acknowledgement of the importance that America sees in Goodiepal's "War on the stupidity of modern computer music and media based art".
• "Round five: Heal the wounds and apply the new solution" - Goodiepal has since 2007 been running autonomous schools from around Scandinavia, among other places at Momentum – Nordic Biennial of Contemporary Art 2009 in Jeløy outside the city of Moss, Norway, and at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Roskilde, Denmark, [http://www.flickr.com/photos/32556543@N05/4420014579/in/set-72157609437204597/ where Goodiepal gave lectures, performances and workshops during 2010.
By the end of 2008, Goodiepal declared himself nearly bankrupt having spent a significant but unspecified amount of money on his "Gentleman's War".
In November 2010, Goodiepal received the Danish Heinrich Prize at Den Grå Hal, Christiania, for his war on the Royal Academy of Music. Rumours had it that he would not show up, due to the arrest order placed on his head by Danish police, but Goodiepal managed and from the stage warned about a new wave of racism growing inside the European welfare system. He left the party without any interference from the police.
2012: El Camino Del Hardcore - Rejsen Til Nordens Indre".
In 2012 Goodiepal & ALKU have published a book called: "El Camino del Hardcore - Rejsen Til Nordens Indre".
He has also a feature on the Radio Web MACBA podcast "Composing with process", in which he holds a conversation with Jesper Pedersen and Kjartan Ólafsson, creator of the CALMUS software.

Dave Mejias

David L. "Dave" Mejias is an American politician. He was the Democratic candidate for the New York State Senate sixth district seat, which is currently held by 34 year incumbent Kemp Hannon. Mejias was a member of the County Legislature of Nassau County, New York, and ran as a Democratic candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 2006.
Background.
Mejias's father, José, was a Cuban who was arrested in 1961 for anti-Castro activism and later fled to the United States upon being released. Dave Mejias was born, raised, and currently resides in Farmingdale, New York. He graduated from SUNY Albany, where he was Vice President of the Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. He earned his J.D. degree from Fordham University School of Law. He is the managing partner of Mejias, Milgrim & Alvarado, PC, a law firm specializing in personal Injury, matrimonial, and criminal law.
Political career.
In 2003, Mejias was elected to the Nassau County Legislature, becoming the first Latino elected to that body. He was re-elected in 2005. In August 2006, the AFL-CIO gave their endorsement to Mejias, over the incumbent Peter T. King (R), whom they had endorsed in each election for the previous fourteen years, ever since King was first elected to Congress.
In his first two years in office, Mejias supported Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi and voted for budgets that, along with the state bailout of the County, resulted in no tax increases for residents and improved bond ratings for the County. Nassau County now has an "A" bond rating for the first time in a decade.
2006 Congressional election.
In the 2006 Congressional election, Mejias was the Democratic nominee to represent the Third Congressional District of New York. That seat is currently held by Republican Peter King (R-Seaford), chairman of House Committee on Homeland Security. Despite Newsday's backing, King defeated Mejias in the election 56-44 percent. Despite King's 12 point victory, Mejias gave King the toughest challenge since King's 1st election in 1992. King, who in previous elections didn't spend all that much, spent more than $2 million on the campaign, outspending Mejias by more than a 2-1 margin. 
Mejias's campaign was centralized mostly on criticized King for his close link to President George W. Bush. For example, King was quoted in stating "I thank God every night that he is our president. You should do the same."
Mejias has also criticized King, who was the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, over the Department of Homeland Security's $83 million reduction in funding for New York City.
In September 2006, King sent a letter to his constituents in which he attempted to link Mejias to men King called "radical" Muslim leaders on Long Island. The letter backfired when federal records showed that King himself accepted thousands of dollars more than Mejias in campaign contributions from the same donors.

Series of tubes

"A series of tubes" is a phrase coined originally as an analogy by then-United States Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) to describe the Internet in the context of opposing network neutrality. On June 28, 2006, he used this metaphor to criticize a proposed amendment to a committee bill. The amendment would have prohibited Internet Access providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon Communications from charging fees to give some companies' data a higher priority in relation to other traffic. This metaphor has been widely ridiculed, despite the fact that he was in charge of regulating the Internet. Edward Felten, Princeton University professor of computer science, pointed out the unfairness of some criticisms of Stevens' wording, while maintaining that the underlying arguments were rather weak.
Partial text of Stevens' comments.
Ted Stevens's Quotes
Media commentary.
On June 28, 2006, Public Knowledge government affairs manager Alex Curtis wrote a brief blog entry introducing the senator's speech and posted an MP3 recording. The next day, the "Wired" magazine blog "27B Stroke 6" featured a lengthier post by Ryan Singel, which included Singel's transcriptions of some parts of Stevens's speech considered the most humorous. Within days, thousands of other blogs and message boards posted the story.
Most writers and commentators derisively cited several of Stevens's misunderstandings of Internet technology, arguing that the speech showed that he had formed a strong opinion on a topic which he understood poorly (e.g., referring to an e-mail message as "an Internet" and blaming bandwidth issues for an e-mail problem much more likely to be caused by mail server or routing issues). The story sparked mainstream media attention, including a mention in the "New York Times". The technology podcast "This Week in Tech" discussed the incident.
According to "The Wall Street Journal", as summarized by MediaPost commentator Ross Fadner:
Related nomenclature.
The term "pipe" is a commonly used idiom to refer to a data connection, with pipe diameter being analogous to bandwidth or throughput. For instance, high-bandwidth connections are often referred to as "fat pipes".
Pop culture references.
"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" has made multiple references to "Techno" Ted Stevens's "series of tubes" description; as a result, Stevens has become well known as the person who once headed the committee charged with regulating the Internet. "I have a letter from a big scientist who said I was absolutely right in using the word 'tubes'," Stevens said to reporters in response to "The Daily Show"'s coverage. When asked if he'd think about going on the show to debate Jon Stewart, Stevens replied, "I'd consider it."
In the keynote speech at the 2007 Penny Arcade Expo, Wil Wheaton spoke about remembering when the Internet was more like a truck than a series of tubes.
Google has included references to this in two of its products. Gears' about box says "the gears that power the tubes" and Google Chrome had an easter egg at the address codice_1 which displayed a screensaver of tubes (if Windows XP's "sspipes.scr" is installed) with the page title "Don't Clog the Tubes!" When "about:internets" was entered on a computer lacking that screensaver, the tab displayed a gray screen with the page title "The Tubes are Clogged!" This easter egg was removed as of the 2.0.159.1 release.
The comments made by Ted Stevens are frequently used in Ventrilo Harassment videos on YouTube and other video sharing websites.
Tribute.
Alexandra Petri of the "Washington Post" wrote a humorous article entitled "Sen. Stevens, the tubes salute you" after Stevens died in an airplane crash August 9, 2010:
And as people remember him, make ill-timed jests, and muse on his legacy—all in real time, in great profusion—I worry that they are disrupting the ability of people elsewhere to receive their Internets. But for us in the Facebook generation who weren't around for the first plane crash and know the Bridge to Nowhere primarily as an SNL punchline, the senator's legacy is in that series of tubes.
The "Bridge to Nowhere" refers to the Gravina Island Bridge, another issue Stevens was responsible for, for which he was also mocked.

Tenley Circle

Tenley Circle is a traffic circle in the Northwest Washington, D.C. neighborhood of Tenleytown. Tenley Circle lies at the intersection of Nebraska Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, and Yuma Street.
The circle gets its name from John Tennally, a tavern owner and local resident circa 1790. As is common with the passage of time, the name "Tennally" evolved into the name "Tenley" with which we are familiar today. The name change was relatively gradual and historic photos of The District's streetcar system have indicated that streetcars of the period were signed with the original spelling.
The circle is bounded by St. Ann Roman Catholic Church, a large imposing stone church, American University's Tenley Campus, and Wisconsin Avenue Baptist Church.
The circle is an important transportation hub for area residents, featuring stops for the MetroBus "30's Line," as well as H3, H4, M4, N2, and N8 routes. The Tenleytown-AU metro station is one block north of the circle where one is able to catch a free shuttle to the main campus of American University a little less than a mile away. 
Unlike many of the circles in Washington, Tenley's traffic pattern has evolved such that the dominant roadway, Wisconsin Ave., can pass straight through the center instead of going around the outside circumference.

Isabella, Countess of Menteith

Isabella, Countess of Menteith was the eldest daughter of Muireadhach II, Mormaer of Menteith. When the old mormaer died without legitimate male heir in 1233, the province passed to Isabella. 
Isabella married Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, bringing the mormaerdom temporarily into the hands of the Comyn family. When her husband died in 1258, Isabella married again, this time to an English knight named John Russell. This mediocre marriage left her too weak to protect her status. Already by 1259, Walter Stewart (nicknamed "Ballaich") was claiming the province for his wife, Isabella's sister Mary. By 1261, Isabella was arrested and deposed from rulership of the province on charges of poisoning her late husband. 
Isabella may have had one son by Walter Comyn, a man named Henry who witnesses a charter of Maol Domhnaich, Mormaer of Lennox. However, if this Henry was their son, he did not live long enough to inherit from his parents.
