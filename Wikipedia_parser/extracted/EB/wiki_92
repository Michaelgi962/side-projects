Seeley Booth

Seeley Joseph Booth is a fictional character in the US television series "Bones" (2005–present), portrayed by David Boreanaz. Agent Booth is a co-protagonist of the series with his wife Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel), whom he affectionately refers to as "Bones".
Background.
Booth is from Philadelphia but was raised in Pittsburgh. He is a fan of the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team; pictures of the team hang on the back wall of his office and he has been seen wearing a Flyers t-shirt in several episodes. During many episodes he is seen drinking from a Pittsburgh Steelers coffee mug, suggesting he is also a fan of that football team; in season 6, episode 16 "The Blackout in the Blizzard" he acquires a row of seats from Veterans Stadium and recounts for Dr. Brennan how he attended game 6 of the 1980 World Series with his father, describing it as the "best day of life". A deeply religious man, he was raised and still is a practicing Catholic, having served as an altar boy during his youth; throughout the series he is often seen wearing a St. Christopher medal, which was given to him by his grandfather before being deployed to Somalia, around his neck. In "A Boy in a Tree" it is implied that he attended public schools. It is not mentioned where or when he attended college but he has stated that he put himself through college teaching dance. He has been an avid athlete and sports fan since his high school days. His home and office walls are adorned with various sports memorabilia including a signed picture of Bruins player Bobby Orr and the jersey of Pittsburgh Penguins player Mario Lemieux.
Booth's age is never specified. In Season 3 it is stated that he is 35 years old and that Brennan is five years younger than him and in Season 4 the "squints" celebrate his 36th birthday, putting his birth year sometime between 1970 and 1972.
Family.
Booth is the older of two boys and has a younger brother Jared (Brendan Fehr). Their father "flew Thuds and Phantoms in Vietnam" and moved to Philadelphia where he worked as a barber and eventually started a family. After his death, Booth found a Purple Heart medal among his possessions, indicating he was likely shot down and injured at some point during the war. Their mother Marianne (Joanna Cassidy) was a dancer and composed jingles for television advertisements. Booth is a (fictional) member of the Anglo-American Booth family, best known for producing generations of actors, as well as John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln; because of the latter, Booth does not like to talk about the fact.
For the first three seasons, details on Booth's family background were generally sketchy as he rarely mentioned his family members. He is still uncomfortable discussing his childhood and becomes especially defensive when asked about it. Prior to Jared's appearance in the episode "The Con Man in the Meth Lab", Booth's long-time friend Dr. Camille Saroyan was the only one who knew about his childhood; in the same episode, Sweets observed the brothers and independently came to the conclusion himself that they were products of a physically abusive household. However, it is not until Season 5 when Booth's grandfather Hank is introduced that his abusive background is fully revealed.
In Season 8 Booth bluntly tells Bones that he "grew up in a household of violence and hatred", one of the few times the character has ever openly spoken of his past. When his younger brother Jared is first introduced, it becomes apparent that Booth was estranged from his family. Their father was an abusive alcoholic; this was reinforced by the fact that Booth is able to almost instantly recognize suspects with a drinking problem even when they are sober. Booth used to shield Jared from their father during a beating and was extremely protective of him. The extent of their father's abuse was never fully revealed but based on Booth's vague admissions throughout the show and Hank and Marianne's own statements, it was likely that he was also emotionally neglectful of his ex-wife and sons. One of Booth's deepest fears and insecurities is that he would become like his father, which continues to trouble him to this day. It is implied that their mother was also subjected to abuse by their father as she once mentioned to Bones that she was thrown down a flight of stairs by her ex-husband. Eventually she left the family out of desperation. In the Season 8 episode "The Party in the Pants", she contacts Booth for the first time in over two decades to invite him to her wedding. The boys were essentially singlehandedly raised by their paternal grandfather Hank (Ralph Waite), whom Booth affectionately calls "Pops". Hank had stumbled upon his son abusing Seeley and drove him out of the house. He calls Booth "Shrimp" as Seeley was a young child then. From then on, he raised his two grandsons as his own. Booth has admitted that he might have killed himself as a kid had it not been for his grandfather.
Military Service and FBI.
It is not stated when Booth enlisted in the United States Army. He is at least a third-generation military man; his grandfather Hank was in the military police and served in the Korean War and his father was a Vietnam War veteran. It is mentioned that, prior to Jared's court-martial and dishonorable discharge in Season 4 for stealing evidence to save Booth, "no Booth has ever gotten a dishonorable discharge". Based on facts subsequently revealed throughout the show, he would have served during the 1990s, prior to joining the FBI. He was a sniper in the 101st Airborne Division, Special Forces and 75th Ranger Regiment and served in the Gulf War, Somalia, Guatemala and Kosovo and various places. He also stated that he has trained with Delta Force operatives and it has been indicated that he has served on classified missions. For a time, he held the record for the longest shot ("over a kilometer") made in combat. In the Season 5 finale, he is also shown wearing a 101st combat patch, Special Forces and Ranger qualification tabs, and Combat Infantry, HALO, Air Assault and Parachutist badges. Booth also has in his shadow box in his office is a set of pathfinder wings. While in the military he earned a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and the Army Good Conduct Medal. His achievement and service medals can be seen in the shadow boxes mounted on the wall behind his desk in his office. He left the Army with the rank of master sergeant.
In the episode "The Beginning in the End", Booth is approached by a Colonel Pelant, an acquaintance from his time in the Rangers, and handed a letter from the Secretary of Defense requesting him to return to active duty to train Afghan soldiers in "tracking and apprehending insurgents". He is offered a promotion to sergeant major and a position as an adviser to the Afghan National Army. Although initially reluctant, Booth accepts and is deployed to Afghanistan during the time frame between Season 5 and 6 when he, Bones, Angela and Hodgins leave Washington for a year-long sabbatical.
Despite his distinguished service record, Booth is generally reticent about his military service and rarely speaks about it openly, even with Bones Part of the reason is the classified nature of some his work history. Bones subsequently discovers that he has been tortured while held as a POW in the Middle East, which Booth never elaborated on and has not been addressed since, after looking at his x-rays. In Season 2 he was kidnapped and tortured with a heated screwdriver by a mobster for refusing to give information and later told Bones that he has been "tortured worse". In Season 9, Bones mentions that he does not throw his socks into the hamper after coming home from work so that his feet stay warm, suggesting that he still suffers from the physical ramifications of the torture he endured. He is still haunted by memories from his time in the Army, having lost friends in combat and watched his own buddy bleed to death in his arms; he is noticeably affected when investigating cases involving veterans. It is apparent that he suffers from survivor guilt, although the term is never used in the show, and his "kill count" is a major sore point and an extremely sensitive issue for him. Former priest and Army chaplain Aldo Clemens, whom Booth regularly confessed to while he was in the service, told Bones that Booth was the reason why he left the priesthood and decided that God was his "worst enemy" and a "bastard". In the episode "Hero in the Hold" it is revealed that he has blamed himself for the death of his spotter Corporal Edward "Teddy" Parker, whom Booth named his son Parker after, on a sniper mission even though Teddy had unintentionally disobeyed orders to keep his head down and was fatally shot as a result. He sought out Sweets for counseling in Season 6 after he was confronted by his former mentor and ex-military sniper-turned-vigilante Jacob Broadsky. Towards the end of Season 1 he confessed to Bones for the first time about the buried guilt, after much persuasion from a fellow veteran, telling her "It's never just the one person who dies, Bones. [...] With each shot we all die a little bit." In Season 9, when Bones receives a $75,000 advanced check from her book sales and asks Booth what he wants to do with it, he opts to donate it to the Wounded Warrior Project, a charity for injured veterans.
Booth had a gambling problem, which is implied to have developed as a coping mechanism after leaving a stressful, war-time environment. According to flashbacks in "The Parts in the Sum of the Whole", he only started to the kick the habit after meeting (and subsequently asking out) Bones for the first time while working a case together. As of the series pilot he has been clean after attending GA meetings and has been able to resist the urge on several occasions when a case required him to be at a casino or a similar environment. In several episodes he can be seen twirling a poker chip or playing with a dice.
In Season 4, it is stated that Booth has been in the FBI for twelve years, which implies that he would have joined the Bureau around 1996. However, this contradicts his statements in Season 6 about going AWOL to be present at the birth of his son Parker as Parker was four when the show premiered in 2005. A possible realistic explanation would be that Booth remained in the Army as a reservist.
Characterization.
John Kubicke of BuddyTV described Booth as "charming, funny, a tad brutish but ultimately warm and caring". He is worldly wise, socially at ease with people, very athletic, and apparently sexually confident with women. He often refers to himself as a jock, having played football and several other sports in high school and college. Other characters have described him as an "alpha male" and "a complex man".
Booth is portrayed as a patriot and has a strong sense of duty to his country and job. In "Soldier on the Grave", Angela described him as "someone who wants to keep honor and responsibility alive". For much of Season 1, this often led to friction between him and Jack Hodgins, who held anti-government views. According to Cam, Booth relies on his faith in the government to keep his sanity intact having killed nearly fifty people on government orders as an Army sniper. He takes his oath and position as a federal agent seriously and holds himself to an equally high standard; he is especially disgusted whenever a corrupt law enforcement officer is involved and refuses to participate in cover-ups. Booth is also loyal to his colleagues and protective of his family to the point where he will not hesitate to physically threaten and intimidate anyone who attempts to harm them.
Booth is occasionally over-protective, often to Bones' annoyance, of his family and people he cares about. Sweets theorized that his protective instincts – which he labeled "white knight syndrome" – stems from his abusive childhood and his having to frequently protect his younger brother Jared from their alcoholic father. His former boss Sam Cullen called him a "paladin" – "Defender of the faith, protector".
Due in part to his Catholic upbringing, Booth sees the world and morality in black and white, which contrasts Bones' objective view of such abstract concepts. This conflicting view is often a source of friction and, later, banter between them. Booth draws the line between the "good guys" and "bad guys" and stated that "life is about taking sides", when asked about how he is able to reconcile his past as a sniper while hunting down his former mentor-turned-vigilante Jacob Broadsky. Booth once told Sweets that while he has killed (because he was following orders), he has never murdered. It is stated that Booth will not pull the trigger unless he is absolutely certain of the identity and guilt of the "target" he is about to kill and that it is sanctioned by a higher authority and not on his own volition. Booth views justice in a similarly subjective way and believes that committing a crime is never justifiable regardless of the circumstances. This, coupled by his "follow the book" approach, is apparent when he arrests Bones' father Max, for killing the Deputy Director of the FBI (who was revealed to be part of a cover-up), in her own office without hesitation in the Season 2 finale "Stargazer in a Puddle", although he does apologize to Bones before leading Max out in handcuffs.
One of Booth's noted characteristics is his respect for life. Despite spending most of his working life around firearms, it is a known fact that he dislikes having to kill another human being and remains is a sensitive topic for him. His past as a sniper still haunts him emotionally and Bones surmised that his choice to become an FBI agent and his dedication for seeking justice for victims was his way of paying penance. In the pilot, he tells Bones that he hopes to catch as many criminals as people he has killed. In the episode "The Man in the S.U.V.", after shooting and killing a terrorist about to detonate a bomb at a crowded convention center, he refused to accept credit and explains to Bones that he finds "no pleasure in taking someone's life". When he shot a mechanical clown on an ice cream truck for seemingly no reason, he was ordered to see Dr. Gordon Wyatt for counseling in order to get his badge and gun back. In subsequent episodes Dr. Wyatt uncovers the guilt and anger Booth has been harboring for so long. In Season 6 Booth's FBI colleague Dr. Lance Sweets noted that the reason why Booth was able to live through the guilt was his ability to channel it into his career in the FBI and responsibility to his son and those he cared about.
Despite his warm personality, Booth tends to shy away from the limelight when it comes to taking credit for solving a case. He often plays down his own intelligence to let Bones take the credit to make her feel good, although most of the team eventually saw through his ruse.
When investigating a crime, Booth leans toward intuition and his ability to connect and read people, a quantity unknown to an empiricist like Bones. His interpersonal approach is especially effective in the interrogation room – "domain". Despite lacking the professional training of Bones and Sweets, he is able to read and detect behavioral cues and accurately establish motive. Initially Bones rebuffs Booth's intuition as she (at first) rejects anything that cannot be measured with numbers, research and scientific evidence but he soon earns hers and the team's respect for his ability to interpret evidence. In Season 4 she tries to interrogate a suspect for the first time and concedes that the interpersonal aspects of the job and interrogations are still exclusively Booth's area of expertise. In Season 9, while he and Bones were observing Sweets interrogating a highly intelligent suspect, he explains to her Sweets' techniques and the suspect's behavioral responses. Angela observed that his ability to "[pretend to be stupider than he actually is most of the time" to lure the suspect into a false sense of security was what made him such a skilled interrogator, as opposed to Bones, whose bluntness often gives a poor first impression and puts people off. Booth is often frustrated by the scientific jargon Bones and the other scientists, and sometimes Sweets, tend to use, as shown when he abruptly cuts Bones and Hodgins off in the middle of a sentence and tells them to "translate" into layman's terms. Although lacking the squints' "book smarts", he compensates with his instincts honed from his experience in the FBI, as shown by the fact that he is able to accurately guess Bones' top three password choices.
Booth tends to keep his personal and professional life as separate as possible and is territorial, especially in regards to his personal life and what he considers his personal space. This is exhibited by the fact that he displays his military medals and memorabilia in his office rather than in his home. He is also extremely guarded and taciturn about most aspects of his personal life, namely his abusive father, troubled childhood, "love life" and traumatic experiences in the military. For example, in the episode "A Night at the Bones Museum", he becomes offended when Bones talks about him while on a date with his "boss's boss" Andrew Hacker and curtly tells her that "what goes on between us is ours". When asked more personal questions, such as about his emotional problems, especially by Sweets or Bones, his first reaction is to change the subject, deflect them with jokes or become defensive. Even when confronted privately "out of office", he usually refuses to talk outright, choosing instead to downplay his emotions and brood over a drink at the bar. In later seasons, he has begun to open up to and confide in Bones.
Booth has temperament issues and, as shown in several episodes, it has gotten him in trouble on occasion. He shoots the clown head on an ice cream truck in season 2 episode "The Girl in the Gator" due to coulrophobia. As a result his service pistol is confiscated and he is ordered to see Dr Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) for counseling sessions to be cleared for duty. In Season 4 he shoots a a black metal band's guitar amplifier after the guitarist spits on his badge and was promptly reprimanded by Dr Wyatt. There is a running gag in the show where Booth often sarcastically threatens to shoot a squint (especially Hodgins or a "squintern") in exasperation when they start "rambling" or occasionally an uncooperative suspect in the interrogation room. Despite his ability to emotionally detach himself from a case and compartmentalize, there were instances where he has "snapped", especially when a case touches a sensitive such as when he physically hit a suspect after the latter hit his wife while both were being questioned. Having grown up in an abusive home, he has admitted to Sweets and Bones of his fears that he would become like his father.
On the job, Booth is characterized as a "man of action" and once claimed that he would "rot behind a desk". Early in season 8, he was given an opportunity to earn a promotion to an administrative position but passed up the chance in order to help Sweets and rookie agent Olivia Sparling with an emergency situation involving an assassin armed with an explosive. Bones herself commented that Booth being assigned to a desk job was akin to "caging an animal" and that he was "meant to run free". He does not hesitate to get physical when a situation requires it, such as chasing down a suspect through a crowd on foot or leading a SWAT team himself during a hostage rescue or raid.
Booth is a fan of classic rock and arena rock music. He has expressed great affection for the group Foreigner and poked fun at Bones for her interest in world, rap, and hip hop music. He also likes the band Poco. In the season three finale, he listens to the hardcore punk/punkabilly band Social Distortion. In the Season 4 episode "Mayhem on the Cross" he mentions that his father thought that Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys sounded the same. Given the relatively underground nature of the California hardcore punk scene, of which Social Distortion, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys were all seminal members, it is most likely that Booth's father would have heard these bands only if Booth himself had played their records. He is also familiar with country music as his grandfather "raised on Grand Ole Opry".
Booth shows a preference for the old school. He despises new age innovations, feeling that technology dehumanizes everything. He hates cappuccinos, referring to it as "foamy crap" and not actual coffee, only drinking his coffee black. He also dislikes reading news on a tablet, preferring to hold the newspaper in his hand, and had a vintage fridge in his kitchen at his old apartment. Bones told Hannah that Booth has always wanted an old-fashioned rotary telephone, as he believes that it is what a phone should be: sturdy and heavy enough to knock someone out. He also believes that the mechanics of it make it human.
It is revealed in the season three episode "The Mummy in The Maze" that Booth suffers from coulrophobia. When traveling through a haunted house, Booth is frightened of an evil clown mannequin; Brennan is bewildered by his behavior and Booth feels ashamed when he purposely avoids walking by the mannequin. In season two when he shot a large plastic clown head on an ice cream truck, annoyed with the music. Booth wears a "Cocky" belt buckle in episodes following "The Boneless Bride in the River", which is absent in the first episode of season five after recovery from surgery. However in the first two seasons he wears a stylized eagle buckle and for most of Season 9 he is seen wearing a heavy buckle with crossed muskets, the insignia of the US Army Infantry Branch. He also likes to wear colorful socks. In the episode "The Wannabe in the Weeds", it is revealed that he is allergic to grass.
Toward the end of season 4, Booth suffers from a brain tumor that leads him to hallucinate conversations with Stewie Griffin. The tumor is successfully removed, but it leaves him with residual memory loss and a lack of confidence in the field.
Work.
In the series pilot, Booth was introduced as an FBI special agent in the homicide department who seeks the professional opinion of Dr. Temperance Brennan at the Jeffersonian Institute. He was eventually made the liaison between the Jeffersonian and the FBI, much to his chagrin, but he soon develops a close working relationship with the Jeffersonian team of scientists, whom Booth and his fellow FBI agents call "squints", a nickname which has since become a term of endearment Bones and her team associate him with. Booth once referred to the Jeffersonian team, whom he affectionately calls the "squint squad", as "my people". Caroline Julian, a federal prosecutor who frequently works with them, has commented that aside from him "there isn't a single normal law enforcement officer who could work with these people." Bones herself often immediately objects when another agent (other than Booth) is assigned to work with her. Although not as "book smart" as the other "squints", he is quick to link evidence with and often uses his "street smarts" and intuition to assist the case. He is characterized as a "hands on" agent and makes no secret of his distaste for paperwork and formal documentation.
Booth is based at the J. Edgar Hoover Building along with his colleague Dr. Lance Sweets but frequents the Jeffersonian lab for updates on the evidence and has his own access card. The fact that he has his own office and is called "sir" by younger agents denotes some seniority or supervisory status. It has been implied through interactions with other characters that Booth is generally well regarded and respected within the Bureau for his skill, even if his distaste for the politics that entails his job has put him at odds with his boss and other federal law enforcement agencies. Little is known about his work history in the FBI except for the fact that he spent a period of time in Japan as part of an exchange program with the Tokyo Police. His call sign is 22705.
Because of his training as a FBI agent and military background, he adheres to protocol and the chain of command. As such, he often has to keep the "squints" in line when a case emotionally affects them so that they abide by the rules and not jeopardize the case. However, he has no qualms about stretching the rules to its limit or using underhand tactics (without breaking protocol outright) and will go through great lengths to obtain a confession, especially when the situation is urgent or desperate (e.g. a hostage situation). His former military training and experience has proven useful to at times, especially in cases involving firearms or terrorists. Other notable incidents include in Season 4 when he was kidnapped by "The Grave Digger" and had to find his way out of a decommissioned Navy ship rigged with explosives.; in Season 6 when he was forced to pursue rogue vigilante sniper Jacob Broadsky through a container terminal without back-up; and in Season 8 when he tracks down tech-savvy serial killer Christopher Pelant undetected through an abandoned power plant alone and armed with only a knife, rifle and pistol.
A skilled marksman, Booth is well-known within the Bureau as a "legendary shot". While in the Army he achieved the "Expert" Marksmanship Badge and is still proficient with a sniper rifle. It is indirectly stated in "Fire in the Ice" that he is equally capable of using his weapon with his "wrong hand" (his left hand). In the episode "Proof in the Pudding", he demonstrates the double tap technique with a replica World War II-era Carcano for one of Hodgins' experiments. He is also a skilled knife thrower and is familiar with various types of explosives and weapons.
Booth states in "The Girl in the Gator" that Howard Epps was his fiftieth kill. However, Booth is not technically responsible for Epps' death, so as of "The Man in the Cell" his official kill count is at 49. However, as of "The Mastodon in the Room", Booth's official kill count is at least 54, as he killed the serial killer dressed as a clown (50), Gormogon (51), a corrupt sheriff(52), a doctor (53) and a terrorist (54). 
Booth generally tries to keep his personal and professional life separate. He dislikes bringing his work back home and tries to avoid discussing a case after hours. Despite this, there were several occasions where his past has caught up with him. During the sixth season, while dealing with his complicated relationship with Brennan and his new girlfriend Hannah Burley, Booth faces his former mentor Jacob Broadsky, a former Army sniper who has apparently gone rogue. Broadsky kills the Gravedigger, a serial kidnapper and killer who threatened both Booth and Brennan, destroys identifying evidence, and escapes. Broadsky points out that Booth has no definite proof that would allow him to feel comfortable shooting his old teacher. Booth is comforted by the news that Brennan does not see him and Broadsky as identical and later successfully arrests him without having to kill him. At the end of Season 8 and the beginning of Season 9, serial killer and hacker Christopher Pelant murders several of Booth's fellow FBI agents and blackmails Booth into calling off his wedding to Bones. Booth later tracks down and kills Pelant with a single bullet to the head.
In the Season 9 episode "The Cold in the Case", the Deputy Director personally requests Booth to review other agents' case files and has Sweets analyze Booth's performance and military record. The FBI intends to open a field office in Germany, where the US has a major military command and, according to Booth, would be a prime location for counter-terrorism activities. Booth was being considered for a promotion to head the new field office on a 2-year assignment. After finding out that Sweets had been ordered to review his military record, Booth worried that the promotion was based on his military training as a sniper rather than his service record at the Bureau. Bones expressed her support even if meant having to uproot the family to a foreign country. In the next episode, Booth reveals that the Deputy Director Victor Stark put in his recommendation and that he is to be confirmed by the congressional subcommittee before it is finalized. In the Season 9 finale, he was due to be confirmed by Congress as the new head of the Berlin office but his investigation into the Ghost Killer case and the murder of a conspiracy blogger harboring information of a mass blackmail involving cover-ups and corrupt government officials and businessmen led to him being targeted. Booth presents a proposal entitled "Hiding in sight: A blueprint for addressing potential terrorist activity" at the hearing. However, he was placed on administrative leave when classified information from his service record is exposed by a congressman questioning him, sparking a media frenzy and leading Booth to speculate if he was intentionally nominated for the promotion to be made an example of. At the end of the episode, Booth was attacked by three Delta Force operatives sent to silence him in his and Bones' house and was seriously injured in the subsequent gunfight. Bones calls an ambulance in time but Booth is charged with killing three FBI agents supposedly sent to serve an arrest warrant and is handcuffed to his hospital bed. She is taken into custody for questioning on the orders of Deputy Director Stark after vehemently protesting that the "FBI agents" were in fact Delta Force assassins and that Booth was "defending himself". Their future and careers will be further addressed in Season 10.
Relationships.
Family members.
Abused by his father and abandoned by his mother, Booth has a difficult and troubled relationship with most of his immediate family members. He and his brother Jared had a strained relationship, especially after Jared, a Navy lieutenant commander and intelligence officer based at the Pentagon, asked Bones out on a date while visiting the Jeffersonian with Seeley. Jared Booth is a recurring character in the series, and his arrivals are often met with tension by Booth. Bones has commented that the two brothers "can barely be in a room together". Booth tended to be "over-protective" of Jared, which the latter resented, when they were growing up and it added to the animosity. Jared once told Sweets that "having a big brother is like having an extra dad, only a dad who protects you from your real dad." When they were young, Booth would protect Jared from their father by shielding him during a beating. In Season 4, Booth sacrificed credit for a major crime bust and potential promotion to keep Jared from getting arrested after he was caught drunk-driving as another DUI would cost him his Navy career. Cam has said that Jared had a history of getting into trouble and Booth having to constantly bail him out. Their relationship improved dramatically after Jared steals critical evidence under pretex of a classified military intelligence operation to assist the Jeffersonian team to rescue Booth from "The Grave Digger", sacrificing his Navy career as a result. In "The Dentist in the Ditch", he introduces his fiancée Padme to Seeley and asks him to be his best man at their wedding.
Booth is close to his grandfather Hank. Prior to the character's introduction, Hank was rarely mentioned, at least by name, but it is apparent that he is fond of Booth and Booth cares deeply for him. Hank once told Bones during a visit that he was "more proud of than anybody in the world".
For many years, Booth resented his parents and the mere mention of them, particularly his father, would illicit a hostile response from him. He detested his father for physically abusing him and Jared when they were young and, by his own statements, had not seen him for twenty years. In Season 7 he showed little emotion when he learns of his father's death, which concerned Hank and Bones. After much persuasion from Bones, Booth reluctantly opens the box his father had left to him and sifts through the contents, which included a Purple Heart medal, the 1980 World Series tickets and old photos of father and son. It was one of the rare moments when Booth shed tears.
In Season 8, when his mother Marianne reappears after 24 years to ask Booth to give her away at her wedding to her fiancee, he was reluctant to do so as he was still angry with her for abandoning the family. After realizing that Marianne was genuinely trying to repair their relationship and seeing how well she got along with Bones and their daughter Christine, Booth decides to go to his mother's wedding. She, along with Hank and Parker, were present at Booth and Bones' wedding in Season 9.
Booth is characterized as a doting father to his two children, Parker and Christine. He has a son named Parker (Ty Panitz) with his ex-girlfriend, Rebecca, who refused to marry him. Rebecca is at first hostile, and denied him visitation out of spite, but relations between them later dramatically improve. Initially Booth had mistakenly thought that she turned him down because the precarious nature of his job and irregular work hours would prevent him from being a good father but she later confronts him and assures him that he was a "wonderful father" and that Parker was a "lucky kid". Parker is named after a friend of Booth's from the Army Rangers, Corporal Edward "Teddy" Parker, who was fatally shot while spotting for Booth on a sniper mission. In the Season 1 episode "The Man in the Fallout Shelter", Parker is first introduced to show and it is revealed that prior to this, none of the "squints", including Bones, knew that Booth had a son. Booth is characterized as a doting and occasionally over-protective father. He coached Parker's tee ball team. When he and Bones move into their new house, Parker is given his own room. In Season 7 it is revealed that Parker is living in England with his mother but visits Booth during the holidays.
He and Brennan have their daughter Christine Angela in Season 7. She was named after Brennan's mother Christine Brennan and their co-worker and friend Angela Montenegro. When Parker returns for vacation and sees her for the first time, Booth worries about sibling jealousy but is relieved when Parker hand-makes a mobile for Christine and accepts her into the family. In many episodes, Booth is seen playing with Christine.
In "The Twisted Bones in the Melted Truck", Booth mentions an eccentric aunt of his, who "spent every last dime on old-fashioned cookie jars".
On multiple occasions in the series, characters have stated that Booth is a direct descendant of infamous assassin John Wilkes Booth. However, this is historically inaccurate, as the assassin died childless at the age of 26 just days after killing Abraham Lincoln. More feasible is that he is in fact a descendant of the same family but not John Wilkes himself. In either case, this relation is a particular sore-spot for Booth who does not like having it brought up.
Rebecca Stinson.
Rebecca Stinson, portrayed by Jessica Capshaw, is Booth's ex-girlfriend. When she became pregnant, Booth proposed but Stinson did not accept. They named their son Parker Matthew Booth, the first name "Parker" after Booth's friend who died in the army. They occasionally engage in a liaison, but are mostly just friends. Booth resolves to end their liaisons after Rebecca assuages his doubts that he was a good father to Parker.
Hannah Burley.
Hannah Burley, portrayed by Katheryn Winnick, is Booth's ex-girlfriend whom he met while training soldiers in Afghanistan. She was originally in Afghanistan as a journalist. She moved to Washington D.C. to be with Booth and they eventually moved in together in Booth's apartment. However, they soon break up when Hannah rejects Booth's half-heart proposal and she moves out of his apartment.
With colleagues.
Booth's appointment to the Jeffersonian was met with mixed reaction from Bones' team members. In the first few episodes, it was apparent that Booth did not fit in with the "squints" and was immediately put-off by the scientific jargon they use when discussing a case. He gradually develops a close working relationship and becomes friends with them outside of work. This was evidenced in the Season 2 episode "Judas on a Pole", when Booth was "suspended without pay" by the Deputy Director for pursuing a thirty-year-old cover-up in order to solve the more recent murder of a fellow FBI agent, Bones and the rest of the team, realizing that it meant that Booth can no longer work with them, all volunteer to continue the investigation so that Booth will be reinstated. At the end of the episode Booth was reinstated and Bones invites him to join the rest of the team in celebrating Zack Addy's appointment at the Jeffersonian, telling him that "we are, all of us, your squints". The rest of the team have since accepted Booth, as shown in several episodes where Booth's life was threatened and the "squints" all go the extra mile to ensure his safety. Likewise he vows to protect them at all costs when they were threatened by rogue sniper Jacob Broadsky in Season 6 and serial killer Christopher Pelant in Season 8. Whenever one of them encounters a traumatic event (e.g. watching someone die) he shows concern and tries to help them deal with the trauma, such as when co-worker and intern Vincent Nigel-Murray was killed in their own lab.
Early in Season 1 Jack Hodgins was particularly hostile to him due to his disdain for the government and bureaucracy in general. Booth's patriotism, position as a federal agent and military background and Hodgins' argumentative nature further added to the friction. Booth soon earns his respect when he lets Hodgins accompany him to rescue Bones, who was being held captive by a rogue FBI agent, and Hodgins witnesses Booth shooting the perpetrator as the latter was about to kill Bones. While they still maintain their respective opposing views, they are on friendly terms and Booth often calls him "bug boy". At the end of the second season, he agrees to be Hodgin's best man in his wedding to Angela Montenegro (albeit as the second choice after Zack Addy turned the position down). Hodgins also asks for Booth's advice about proposing to Angela, and later asks Booth to be his best man. Booth has the tendency to cut Hodgins off in the middle of a conversation whenever the latter starts using scientific jargon, although Hodgins generally tolerates it. In season 4, when Booth's FBI colleague Special Agent Perotta takes over an investigation in which Booth is a suspect, Hodgins and intern Wendell Bray immediately declare to Agent Perotta that they are "Booth's people" rather than Perotta's. Booth also intentionally ignores Hodgins' "insane conspiracist ravings" and uses Hodgins' knowledge to his advantage, especially while investigating the Gormogon murders.
Of the "squints", Booth gets along best with Angela Montenegro due to her ability to relate to him in layman's terms and knowledge of pop culture. Angela was initially attracted to Booth. When she realizes that Booth and Bones were "meant for each other", she repeatedly attempts to match-make them. She often gave both of them tips on how to get along with and appease the other.
Booth had a difficult relationship with Brennan's assistant Zack Addy, as he finds Addy's cold naïveté and social awkwardness disconcerting and, later, irritating. After failing to woo a colleague, "Naomi from paleontology", whom he was attracted to, Addy approached Booth for "advice" in the episode "A Boy in a Tree", much to Booth's annoyance and did so ever since. Booth has threatened to shoot Addy on several occasions out of exasperation. Addy admires Booth as a man of experience, and repeatedly asks him for advice on various issues, including sexual relationships. Booth convinces Addy that ignoring one another is a form of male bonding in order to deter Addy from continuously asking him anymore awkward questions and so that he could avoid hurting Addy's feelings. In Season 2 Addy receives a letter from the White House requesting his services in Iraq and Addy asks Booth if "it hurt to get shot", as Booth was the only one of the group who had any first-hand combat experience in a war zone. When Booth asks him why, he shows Booth the letter, explaining that he chose to ask Booth as the latter " more about duty and honor than anyone else I know". Before Addy goes to Iraq, Booth gives him a harmonica as a parting gift.
When fellow FBI agent Dr. Lance Sweets first joined the team, Booth treated him in a condescending manner, due to his youth and boyish looks. Booth was one of the few who acknowledged the importance of psychological insight into an investigation and would bring Sweets along to investigations, albeit grudgingly — he disliked Sweets' habit of repeatedly questioning him when he was in a bad mood or confronting him with details of his private life when in the car en route to the crime scene despite Sweets' good intentions. Whenever Sweets made him feel uncomfortable in that manner, he would interrupt and cut him off with a sarcastic comment or directly tell him to be quiet. Booth became less sarcastic and more understanding with Sweets when he learns about the latter's abusive childhood and subsequent yearning for a family after the death of his adoptive parents as he himself was abused as a child. Despite his tendency to pull rank on Sweets by making him do undesirable tasks such as paperwork or frequently light-heartedly mock him, he cares deeply for the younger agent and the two have an underlying mutual respect. He also consults Sweets on a number of issues, including his feelings for Bones. When Booth was suspended from the field, he consulted with Dr. Gordon Wyatt instead of Sweets, who is the department's designated psychologist, to avoid having to put Sweets in a difficult position of having to choose between their friendship and his professional responsibility. In Season 8 he invites Sweets to stay at his and Bones' home while Sweets deals with second break-up with Daisy.
Booth is generally wary of most of the "squinterns" due to their eccentric personalities, especially Daisy, whom he once brought with him to the field when Brennan, Hodgins and Cam were unavailable and eventually regretted it. He is good friends with Wendell Bray, one of Brennan's favorite interns, and they play ice hockey together on the same amateur team. In Season 9, Booth is visibly distraught when Brennan tells him that she suspects Wendell has Ewing's sarcoma. When Cam was forced to fire Wendell for using medical marijuana due to Jeffersonian rules, Booth, with Bones' and Caroline's help, find a loophole and Wendell is re-employed as an independent consultant reviewing case files and evidence reports, much to Cam's relief and delight.
Camille Saroyan.
Booth rekindles an old relationship with Dr. Camille Saroyan when she joins the Jeffersonian team. However, Booth ends the relationship for the second time after an intense case nearly costs Saroyan her life. Booth asserts that on-the-job romantic relationships endanger the team in high-pressure situations. Booth has known Saroyan for some length of time; in Season 4, it is stated that she has known Booth and his brother Jared for some 15 years. She was one of the few characters who already knew about the brothers' abusive childhood and they call each other by their first names, at least in private; there is a running joke where Booth would counter with "Don't call me Seeley", to which Cam would reply "Don't call me Camille". Despite the breakup, Saroyan and Booth remain close friends, working together on cases and giving each other advice on numerous occasions.
Temperance Brennan.
Temperance is Booth's wife and professional partner throughout the series. While Booth and Brennan maintain a professional relationship and friendship for six years, there is a deep emotional attachment and hints of romantic and sexual tension. Minor characters constantly mistake Booth and Brennan for a romantic couple, an accusation which they consistently and vehemently deny, although they spend more and more time together outside of work and a sexual attraction between them develops. Although she refused to admit it at first, Brennan enjoyed working with him from the beginning, even after their falling out when Booth got her drunk and "fired" her, and, in Season 1, she cajoled him into launching an investigation after finding three bone fragments on a golf course so he could work with the Jeffersonian team on the case despite the fact that the FBI had no jurisdiction. Booth has admitted to Brennan and her father that he finds her "well-structured" and "beautiful," and has once reassured her that she has "her looks and a whole lot more." In "Two Bodies in the Lab", in season 1, and in "The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle", in season 5, Brennan and Booth's mutual love for Foreigner's "Hot Blooded" is mentioned; Booth even refers to it as "their song" in "The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle", and it is the first song on the mix tape he makes for her in "The Ghost in the Machine".
Booth's grandfather Hank and Bones' father Max expressed approval of their relationship early on, even before Booth and Bones openly admitted that they were more than just professional partners, and Hank and Max incredulously asked Booth if he was gay when he denied that he was romantically involved with Bones. Max, in particular, strongly believed that Booth was the right man for his daughter despite the fact that Booth has had to arrest him a number of times for trying to take the law into his hands to protect Bones.
Throughout the show, Booth and Brennan's differences in worldviews are regularly addressed by various characters and was the source of friction early on in their partnership. She was dismissive of his religious beliefs (and organized religion in general) and would take the opportunity to downplay it. In Season 2 Booth expelled her from the interrogation room after she repeatedly made insensitive remarks, despite her good intentions, during an interview with a parish priest. Booth also has several heated arguments over various issues, especially religion. She gradually comes to respect and admire his faith as they grew closer and eventually entered a romantic relationship. In numerous episodes she is shown trying to be supportive of Booth in spite of her social awkwardness, which Booth admits he finds endearing. When Sweets was observing them and writing a book on their relationship, Dr. Gordon Wyatt noted that Booth and Brennan are actually more similar despite appearing to be polar opposites – both experienced traumatic childhoods, are highly competent in their respective fields and extremely guarded about their personal lives.
Booth often takes Bones along to his investigations and interrogations, despite his superiors' and Caroline's initial reservations about a "squint" being in the field. Initially he was irritated by the scientific jargon she frequently used but over time comes to enjoy her company. He also taught her some investigative techniques and "black ops stuff", such as using a credit card to break open a locked door. In Season 4, at Sweets' persuasion, he allows her to interrogate suspects and since then, she has co-interrogated suspects with Booth in Sweets' absence. In the field, he sometimes takes advantage of her status as a civilian to obtain information which he, as a federal agent, would otherwise be unable to obtain without going through the time-consuming bureaucratic process. They often go undercover together as a couple whenever a case requires so.
Booth shows an apparent jealousy of Brennan's romantic relationships, particularly in the episodes "Two Bodies in the Lab", "The Woman in Limbo", "The Headless Witch in the Woods", "The Man in the Mansion", "The Boneless Bride in the River", "The Con Man in the Meth Lab", and "A Night at the Bones Museum". In Season 2 his FBI colleague Special Agent Tim "Sully" Sullivan asks him for "advice" on how to woo Bones, Booth tells him simply that he will not "help get my partner into bed". Booth has a habit of intimidating, confronting or competing with anyone he believes to have a sexual interest in Brennan. He is extremely protective of her, and is often defensive of her to the point of physically assaulting those who pose a threat to her safety. Likewise, Bones has defended him whenever his ability is called into question and repeatedly made known that Booth is the only FBI agent she (and the other "squints") tolerate working with. Booth has saved Brennan's life in several episodes, such as "Aliens in a Spaceship", "The Wannabe in the Weeds" and "The Woman in the Garden". In the third season, their relationship takes on a new component when they are forced to undergo partners therapy with Sweets, who observes that they are very close and there is emotional and sexual tension between them. Partners therapy is extended indefinitely. The partners share their first (in a flashback) and third kisses in "The Parts in the Sum of the Whole"; the second occurs in "The Santa in the Slush" when Booth and Brennan agree to kiss under mistletoe in front of Caroline Julian, an attorney Booth frequently works with. Nearly every episode after season three ends with a scene of Booth and Brennan bonding, which become increasingly romantic over time, reflecting the ever-growing affection Booth and Brennan have for each other. This comes to a head in "The Critic in the Cabernet," in which Brennan asks Booth to donate sperm to father her child. He is startled but eventually agrees. The two begin making plans for her insemination, but before she can go through with it, Booth is diagnosed with a brain tumor.
In Season five, Booth realizes his love for Brennan as he recovers from his tumor. However, he is cautioned by both Dr. Saroyan and Dr. Sweets to be sure of his feelings before confessing his love to Brennan. Afraid that his feelings for her are related solely to his tumor and coma, Booth is conflicted about whether or not to tell Brennan. Afterwards, their relationship remains fraught with sexual tension. Although she shares his feelings, Brennan rejects his advance and states her uncertainty about the possible outcomes of such a relationship given their seemingly conflicting personalities. Booth agrees to respect her wishes and attempts to move on as they continue to work together. In the episode "The Boy with the Answer", Booth is confronted with the possibility that Brennan, claiming she is "tired of dealing with murders and victims and sadness and pain", might leave the Jeffersonian permanently. In the final scene of this episode, Booth watches as Brennan turns to face him while riding away in a taxi. Brennan departs for a year-long anthropological expedition to the Maluku Islands, while Booth agrees to spend a year in Afghanistan, training soldiers to apprehend terrorists. They say goodbye at the airport, agreeing to meet one year later. Their relationship takes a downturn after their return to DC due to Booth's relationship with journalist Hannah Burley; Brennan is apparently disappointed after learning that Hannah gets along with Parker. When Brennan admits that she still has feelings for Booth, he turns her down and says that he loves Hannah. Hannah departs after she turns down Booth's rather half-hearted proposal. Brennan and Booth begin to rekindle their relationship.
In the episode "The Hole in the Heart", in which Vincent Nigel-Murray dies, Booth has Brennan stay at his apartment for her safety. Later that night, Brennan is still overcome with grief over Vincent's death and she turns to Booth for comfort. The two fall into his bed together in a seemingly intimate but non-sexual embrace. The next day, she tells Angela Montenegro that she "got into bed with Booth". In the following episode, she tells Booth that she is pregnant with his child. At the start of season seven, a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are in a relationship and going back and forth between apartments. Booth suggests that they should have their own place; Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment. It causes a minor rift between them. At the end of the episode they are in bed looking at houses on the internet. Booth also tells Brennan he loves her and left it to her to decide when she wants to get married. After much discussion, Booth and Brennan agree to give up their apartments and move in together. In the episode "The Crack in the Code", they decide to buy a two-story home – which Booth jokingly called "The Mighty Hut" – in the suburbs and renovate it. In the following episode, Booth delivers their daughter in a small stable off the road when Brennan cannot make it to the hospital to give birth. They name their baby Christine Angela, after Bones' mother and Angela Montenegro. Booth also tells Bones that she would be the one to ask him to marry her since he believed in marriage and she was the one who needed the make the decision. In the season finale Bones is framed by tech-savvy serial killer Christopher Pelant, who is released when the jury finds him "not guilty". Bones, with help from Max, is forced to go on the run with Christine in order to avoid being arrested and buy Booth and the team enough time to clear her. Prior to her departure, she and Booth had Christine christened into the Catholic church out of respect for his religious beliefs.
The family reunite in the Season 8 premiere and, by the second episode, Bones and Christine have returned home. However the couple have some difficulty readjusting after nearly three months apart with almost no contact with one another. Booth puts up a facade but was still resentful and bitter over the separation. They resolve their differences by the end of the episode.
At the end of Season 8, Brennan finally decides to marry Booth, who is overjoyed. However, their plans are ruined when a vengeful Christopher Pelant blackmails Booth, threatening to kill five random people if Booth marries Brennan. Booth calls off the wedding, but does not explain the real reason to Brennan. For the first several episodes of the season, despite their efforts to mask the frustration and resentment, there was much tension between the two of them and between Booth and the other squints, who accused Booth of being unfaithful and getting "cold feet" at the last minute. In the Season 9 premiere, Booth confided in his friend Aldo Clemens, a former Army chaplain turned bartender, about Pelant's threat against him and he was having trouble mending his relationship with Brennan. At the end of the episode, Brennan decides to stay with Booth, much to his relief, and tell him that she is willing to trust him. In episode 4, "The Sense in the Sacrifice", Booth vows to take Pelant out once and for all, especially after Pelant murdered his colleague FBI Special Agent Flynn and manipulated evidence to frame Flynn. After killing Pelant, Booth reveals to Bones Pelant's threats and why he called the wedding off. He then reiterates his marriage proposal, which she happily accepts.
In the Season 9 episode "The Woman in White", Booth and Bones prepare for their wedding. Bones agreed to a church wedding after realizing the sacrifice Booth had made as the Catholic church does not condone co-habitation; Aldo had told her that Booth was willing to sacrifice his soul and "live in sin" even if it meant being with her. She rationalized the decision, saying that she could see the "beauty" behind the ceremony and tradition associated with a Catholic wedding and added that she also knew Latin. However, their plans are ruined by a cold case and a fire in the church they were to be married at. With Angela's help, they hold a last-minute simple garden ceremony outside the Jeffersonian. Aldo presided over the ceremony in the presence of Booth's mother Marianne, grandfather Hank and son Parker, Bones' father Max and their close friends from the Jeffersonian. They spent their honeymoon in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Reception.
John Kubicek of BuddyTV placed him on his list of the "15 Hottest TV Dads", describing the occasional moments he shares with his son as "tender and real". He was included in "TV Guide"s list of "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters". His relationship with Temperance Brennan was listed in "Entertainment Weekly" "30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples" and "TV Tango"'s "Top 10 Romantically Challenged TV Couples".
Booth's background and personal tastes loosely mirrors that of actor David Boreanaz, who portrays the character. Boreanaz, though born in New York, is from the Philadelphia area, supports the Flyers and was an avid athlete in school.

DeLaval

DeLaval (previously known as Alfa Laval Agri) is a Swedish company, split in 1991 from Alfa Laval, which was founded in 1883 by Gustaf de Laval and Oscar Lamm. The company is a leading producer of dairy and farming machinery. The company is part of the Tetra Laval group, which also includes Tetra Pak and Sidel.
History.
Gustaf de Laval's contributions to the dairy industry included the first centrifugal milk-cream separator and early milking machines, the first of which he patented in 1894. It was not until after his death, however, that the company he founded marketed the first commercially practical milking machine, in 1918. Together with Oscar Lamm, de Laval founded the company Alfa Laval in 1883, which was known as "AB Separator" until 1963 when the present name was introduced. 
In 1991, Alfa Laval Agri, a company producing dairy and farming machinery, was split from Alfa Laval when it was bought by the Tetra Pak Group. When Alfa Laval was sold, Alfa Laval Agri remained a part of the Tetra Pak group and was renamed DeLaval after the company's founder.

<doc id="9901525" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9901525" title="Financial Interest and Syndication Rules">
Financial Interest and Syndication Rules

The Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, widely known as fin-syn rules, were a set of rules imposed by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States in 1970. The FCC sought to prevent the Big Three television networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by preventing them from owning any of the programming that they aired in primetime. The rules also prohibited networks from airing syndicated programming they had a financial stake in. The rules changed the power relationships between networks and television producers, who often had to agree to exorbitant profit participation in order to have their shows aired. Some argue the rules brought about a golden era of independent television production by companies like MTM Enterprises ("The Mary Tyler Moore Show") and Norman Lear's Tandem Productions ("All in the Family"). Others argue the rules made the work of independent television production companies much more difficult because smaller companies could never afford the deficit financing required unless they received network assistance.
Controversial from the very beginning, the fin-syn rule was relaxed slightly during the 1980s. Following the severe changes in the television landscape, such as the rise of the Fox network and cable television, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules were abolished completely in 1993.
It was the repeal of fin-syn that ultimately made newer broadcast networks like UPN and The WB financially interesting for their highly vertically integrated parent media conglomerates Paramount Pictures (Viacom) and Time Warner, respectively.
On average, the number of shows that have been broadcast during primetime by the three main networks (CBS, NBC and ABC) per season has ranged between 63 to 75 shows between the 1987-88 and 2001-02 seasons. In the 1987-88 season, out of a total of 66 primetime shows being broadcast, there were no such shows where the network was either a producer or a co-producer. This number rose steadily to the point that during the 1992-93 season, there were about six shows out of a total of 67 shows produced or co-produced by the network; however as a result of the repeal of the fin-syn rules, this figure jumped to 11 the following year, whilst the total number of shows was barely 73. For the 2001-02 season, this figure rose to 20 shows that were network produced – a change from zero percent, to nine-percent, to 15 percent and from there to 20 percent – over two decades.
Today, each of the five major networks has an affiliated syndication company:
Closely related to fin-syn, the Prime Time Access Rule sought to strengthen local and independent producers by preventing affiliates from airing network programming during much of the early evening hours. This rule was eliminated on August 30, 1996.
Deficit financing.
Before the fin-syn rules, the networks attained greater control and less risk by forcing production companies to deficit finance their programs while also demanding a percentage of the syndication revenues. Deficit financing is an arrangement in which the network pays the studio that makes a show a license fee in exchange for the right to air the program. The license fee is in exchange for the right to air an episode a few times (as a first- and re-run episode), and does not cover the complete cost of production. The studio remains in ownership of the show. Before the fin-syn rules were established, networks would put into practice "profit participation." With this, they gained greater control and avoided the risks by forcing the production companies to deficit finance their programs. Such practice led multiple production companies into financial hardships. Independent producers and those not signed with major working studios were hit the hardest because most of the profit revenue went to the networks. By the mid-1960s, Amanda D. Lotz explains that from profit participation, the networks gained as much as 91 percent of the programming revenue. That is when the government stepped in and got involved with the fin-syn rules in the 1970s.
Deficit financing minimized the substantial risks and costs of developing programs for the networks while initially affording the studios considerable benefits as well. In successful cases, the studio receives a large return on its investment when it re-sells the show in a combination of syndication windows because the sales provide nearly pure profit: no additional work typically goes into the program and the network receives none of the payment. However, if the show is cancelled by the network before producing enough episodes to be syndicated, or if no syndication buyers want the show, the production company must absorb the difference between the cost of production and the original license fee, which can now amount to millions of dollars for each season.
As of 2004, most reality television producers think that deficit-financing will never be financially viable because the vast majority of reality production companies are too small to wait long enough for the big payoff. Instead of syndication, producers have been covering gaps between license fees and rising production costs by selling shows' formats to foreign territories and developing integrated marketing deals with advertisers.
Changes in Financial Interest and Syndication Rules.
The fin-syn rules created two well-defined periods that might be considered characteristics of the multi-channel transition. First; rise of independent studios that provided a competitive environment. Second; media companies like The Walt Disney Company, Viacom, News Corporation and Time Warner made purchases that combined studio and networks to create new kinds of corporate entities.
Throughout the 1970s into the mid-1990s, the fin-syn rules broke a few network-era norms that created programming well before the adjustments to the multi-channel transition. This also led to the creation of a fluid competitive environment between network and studios, however this did not last long.
In 1983, the FCC had received demands from producers to end the fin-syn rules. In 1991 these had officially materialized, and in 1995 the FCC eliminated the rules. After the rules were eliminated, networks began populating their schedules with new shows purchased from studios owned by the network.
Throughout all this the audience began to have more choices and control over entertainment options, and networks were pressured to offer fewer reruns to keep viewers' attention. This led to networks creating programming.

Anahamulina

Anahamulina is an extinct ammonoid cephalopod genus from the Lower Cretaceous. Named by Hyatt, 1900, "Anahamulina" is included in the family Ptychoceratidae, which is part of the Turrilitaceae. 
"Anahamulina" is characterized by an increasingly wide shaft that bends sharply to the opposite direction, at some point ending in a shorter terminal section. The two sections are not in lateral contact. The first, and earlier, shaft has fine, dense, oblique ribs, which in the second, and later, shaft are stronger and more radial. 
Two species are recognized. The type "Anahamulina subcylindrica", named by Hyatt, 1900, is based on "Hamulina subcylindrica" d'Orbigny 1850, and is found in Europe and Japan. "Anahamulina wilcoxensis" named by Imlay, 1960, is known from California and Oregon.

Anahoplites

Anahoplites is a genus of rather involute, compressed hoplitid ammonites with flat sides, narrow flat or grooved venters, and flexious ribs or striae arising from weak umbilicle tubercles that end in fine dense ventrolateral nodes. The elements of their sutures are short, wide and jaggedy. Specimens of "Annahoplites" have diameters typically in the range of although some with diameters of as much as have been reported. The genus lived during the Cretaceous, from the Middle to the late Albian.
"Anahoplites" is now included in the subfamily Anahoplitinae and separated from the Hoplitinae where it was placed in the older, 1957 edition of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part L (Ammonoidea). Genera of the Hoplitinae tend to be more robust, with broader whorls and stronger ribs. 
"Annahoplites" is found in Europe, from England to the transcaspian region in western Asia.

Mobile incinerator

The role of incineration of waste and equipment used for it has changed radically in the recent years. While they were formerly notorious as pollutant spewing technical monsters in the eyes of citizens' groups, nowadays, thermal waste treatment facilities are considered to be the essential pillars of sustainable, forward-looking recycling and raw material sectors.
One benefit of thermal waste treatment facilities is to avoid the yield of methane gas that is a by-product of decay that damages the climate strongly. Another is the production of energy during incineration which helps protection of the environment. Valuable resources will also be conserved by means of separation and exploitation of the recyclables in the waste before incineration.
Trigger of development.
Since 2005, in the European Union, waste can be disposed of, only if it was subject to a treatment before, so that the substances contained in it will become inert, thus to a large extent no more harmful reactions with the environment will occur in the landfill body. The incineration process takes a key role in the waste management by fulfilling this requirement of the Waste Storage Regulation and the Landfill Regulation.
Main purpose.
The main purpose of incineration is to reduce the waste volume and destruction of potentially dangerous substances.
The incineration of waste is classified as an act of exploitation in the Waste Framework Directive adopted in May 2008. The waste that can be used for energy production is subject to the free trade policy and may be moved in the EU trans-boundary. The waste that is to be eliminated entirely, for example hazardous and toxic waste, must be disposed in the vicinity of their origin.
Since the volume of waste is growing continuously, landfilling does not seem to be a long-term solution for waste disposal.
To eliminate this volume, currently, only two approaches remain:
The first approach is waste incineration and the second one, which is probably the best solution, is waste avoidance in addition to re-utilization by means of recycling. That means, the reintroduction of valuable materials into the production cycle. This is possible only if economically feasible and environmentally acceptable methods are available.
Forecast of future developments.
The interest of new design of incinerators and incineration process focus on further improvements in energy efficiency and the further savings of CO2. Engineers are working on several aspects of it, from the optimization of the fuel consumption of the plants, to increasing the efficiency of the equipment. Similarly, they work for better techniques for utilization of rest materials and utilization of slag and flying ash. Today more than 80 percent of slag and flying ash are already being used, mainly in earth filling or in road construction.
Role of mobile incineration in the cycle of waste management.
Mobile incinerators provide a useful addition to the available standards in waste management.
The elimination of hazardous and toxic waste on site is one of the major uses of mobile incinerators.
A mobile incinerator unit is the most suitable product for countries that are starting to tackle waste management, because in such cases, there are no previous statistics about the amount of waste and its composition. Therefore all initial data is based on assumptions only. Until more accurate data can be collected, mobile incinerator units help make the transition, with their mobility and flexibility.
Description of mobile incinerators.
A mobile incinerator is an incineration system mounted on a semi-trailer. Modern incinerators enable complete and sterile incineration of waste. They can be operated virtually anywhere.
A modern mobile incinerator unit (MIU) is capable of incinerating waste at a temperature of up to . This means, it is designed to incinerate all kinds of waste as well as infected hazardous waste. This satisfies the requirement that, waste of hospitals and health facilities must be burnt at a minimum temperature of acc. to the rules of environmental protection. It can also be used to dispose of household waste, as a measure of environment protection.
Arguments for mobile incineration.
An important argument for the mobile incineration is, due to its mobility, it can go to the place of origin of the waste.
This behavior makes it unique, and allows it to be used for waste disposal of several cities and/or hospitals at the same time.
Fighting against epidemics is a serious issue for authorities responsible for the health of their citizens in every country.
In case of an epidemic it is required to dispose the infected hazardous waste of the diseased, hospitals and health facilities as soon as possible.
Latest burner and control technology, together with a flue gas cleaning system is the basis of a modern mobile incinerator unit that meets the highest environmental standards. (See section Emissions)
Process description of a mobile incinerator unit (state of the art).
Fuel.
Natural gas, diesel or biodiesel (so called green fuel) is usable as fuel for the mobile incinerators.
Furnace.
The furnace of a modern mobile incinerator plant consists of a main combustion chamber (primary chamber) and a post combustion chamber (secondary chamber). Charging is carried out mostly from the front of the main combustion chamber through a feed opening system, which is closed by a gate valve. A check valve behind the feed opening prevents direct contact with the combustion chamber. Feeding is automatically controlled by a furnace control system. An automated burner serves for the heating of the combustion chamber subject to the calorific value of the waste charged. The feed opening is released as soon as the necessary flue gas temperature is reached. Two types of design are normally in use; a) an incinerator without grate and b) a rotary-kiln (pyrolysis). In the post combustion chamber the gas is heated to minimum of in order to ensure an environmentally friendly emission based on the European Union Directive (85/337/EEC) on Environmental Impact Assessments (known as the EIA Directive).
The normal combustion temperature is minimum and up to , depending on the process settings. At the end of the thermal process, ash extraction is done through an ash door.
Flue gas cleaning system.
Not all available devices in the market have a flue gas treatment plant. But there are devices available with a dry flue gas cleaning system according to the rigorous European standards. Such a flue gas system mainly consists of a dry sorption system for SO2, HCI, HF, dust reduction, heavy metals, dioxins, etc. To protect the whole system, an automatic emergency water injection facility at the combustion chamber serves for the cooling of flue gas in case, too much waste or waste with too high calorific value is charged. Mobile incinerator units with such a system are environmental friendly.
Fuel and water tank.
A fuel and a water tank are mostly installed on or under the semi-trailer.
Fan and stack.
Mostly a fan transports the flue gas to the stack.
Electrical, instrumentation and control equipment and its standards.
The electrical, instrumentation and control equipment of such a modern incinerator unit includes a main switch, an emergency switch as well as all necessary safety catches, contactors, relays and clamps, key switches for the start up and so on. All measuring, controlling and adjusting functions are realized in a modern mobile incineration plant. There are some safety limits which are processed by the hardware of such a plant. For start-up and operation of the mobile units, most have their own electrical generator on board for power supply. The whole equipment has to comply with European (e.g. DIN 41494, DIN 41488) and/or international (e.g. IEC Publication 297) standards.
Emissions of a modern mobile incinerator with a flue gas cleaning system.
Under normal operation conditions, mobile incinerators are consistently able to keep emissions well below respective limits, for example in accordance to the German TA-Luft regulation. Often, emissions are well below the limits. This applies especially to the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (dioxins and furans). In spite of sophisticated technology, it may happen that higher emission values are reached due to inhomogeneous fuel (waste composition), especially in the phases of start up, shut down and malfunction of a plant.
Legally permitted emission levels.
The legally permitted emission levels usually are far above the actual emissions of pollutants if the emissions over a period of one year is considered.
It should be emphasized however that these isolated instances of exceeding the limits has no effect on public health since even these higher values are usually still within the limits permitted for other technical or chemical plants.
The impact of waste composition on emissions.
Domestic waste has a calorific value of approx. from to approx . Industrial waste shows much higher fluctuation. This inhomogeneity pose a problem during the thermal treatment of waste. The exact composition of waste that is subject to fluctuation can not usually be estimated initially but it shows its potential energy as well as its pollutants during combustion. sorting the waste, recycling and composting has significant influence on the composition of waste which in turn affects its heating value. The large possible variation in calorific value and composition of the waste require a highly complex automatic control during the thermal treatment that must take into account both the reliability of the process and the requirements of environmental protection. Since the requirements of environmental protection and the reliability are contradictory to each other, there must be compromising solutions that are mutually acceptable for both sides. The parameters of O2 and CO concentration and fire room temperature are the main basic variables to be controlled when designing the process.

Poliomyelitis eradication

A public health effort to eliminate all cases of poliomyelitis (polio) infection around the world, begun in 1988 and led by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Rotary Foundation, has reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases from the hundreds of thousands to 291 in 2012—a 99.9% reduction, though recently there has been a bounce back in some countries towards more cases. Of the three types of polio, the last recorded wild case of type 2 was in 1999. The last recorded case of type 3 was on 11 November 2012. All reported cases since 11 November 2012 have been of type 1. If polio is the next disease to be successfully eradicated, this will represent only the third time this has ever been achieved, after smallpox and rinderpest. The goal of eradicating polio worldwide has attracted international and media attention, but since 2001 progress has been erratic in reducing the number of cases, which has led to getting rid of the last 1% being described as "like trying to squeeze Jell-O to death". However, in 2011 incidence rates of the disease were dramatically reduced, and with large reduction again in 2012, hopes for eliminating polio have been rekindled. India is the latest country to successfully stop transmission of polio. May 2014, WHO declared a global health emergency for only the second time since regulations permitting it to do so were adopted in 2007, due to a spread of polio. Per the WHO, Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon have recently allowed the virus to spread — to Afghanistan, Iraq and Equatorial Guinea, respectively.
Factors influencing eradication of polio.
Eradication of polio has been defined in various ways—as elimination of the occurrence of poliomyelitis even in the absence of human intervention, as extinction of poliovirus, such that the infectious agent no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory, as control of an infection to the point at which transmission of the disease ceased within a specified area, and as reduction of the worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis to zero as a result of deliberate efforts, and requiring no further control measures.
In theory, if the right tools were available, it would be possible to eradicate all infectious diseases that reside only in a human host. In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely. Three indicators, however, are considered of primary importance in determining the likelihood of successful eradication: that effective interventional tools are available to interrupt transmission of the agent, such as a vaccine; that diagnostic tools, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, be available to detect infections that can lead to transmission of the disease; and that humans are required for the life-cycle of the agent, which has no other vertebrate reservoir and cannot amplify in the environment.
Strategy.
The most important step in eradication of polio is interruption of endemic transmission of poliovirus. Stopping polio transmission has been pursued through a combination of routine immunization, supplementary immunization campaigns and surveillance of possible outbreaks. The four key strategies outlined by the World Health Organization for stopping polio transmission are:
Vaccination.
Oral polio vaccine is highly effective and inexpensive (about US$0.10 per dose, or US$0.30 per child) and its availability has bolstered efforts to eradicate polio. A study carried out in an isolated Eskimo village showed that antibodies produced from subclinical wild virus infection persisted for at least 40 years. Because the immune response to oral polio vaccine is very similar to natural polio infection, it is expected that oral polio vaccination provides similar lifelong immunity to the virus.
Contact immunity to polio can occur when attenuated poliovirus derived from the oral polio vaccine is excreted, and infects and indirectly vaccinates unvaccinated individuals.
Herd immunity.
Polio vaccination is also important in the development of "herd immunity". For polio to occur in a population, there needs to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If the vast majority of the population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.
When many hosts are vaccinated, especially simultaneously, the transmission of wild virus is blocked, and the virus is unable to find another susceptible individual to infect. Because poliovirus can only survive for a short time in the environment (a few weeks at room temperature, and a few months at 0–8 °C (32–46 °F)) without a human host the virus dies out.
Herd immunity is an important supplement to vaccination. Among those individuals who receive oral polio vaccine, only 95 percent will develop immunity. That means five of every 100 given the vaccine will not develop any immunity and will be susceptible to developing polio. According to the concepts of herd immunity this population whom the vaccine fails, are still protected by the immunity of those around them. Herd immunity can only be achieved when vaccination levels are high. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by herd immunity. If routine immunization were stopped, the number of unvaccinated, susceptible individuals would soon exceed the capability of herd immunity to protect them.
Obstacles.
Among the greatest obstacles to global polio eradication are the lack of basic health infrastructure, which limits vaccine distribution and delivery, the crippling effects of civil war and internal strife, and the sometimes oppositional stance that marginalized communities take against what is perceived as a vertical (top down) intervention. Another challenge has been maintaining the potency of live (attenuated) vaccines in extremely hot or remote areas. The oral polio vaccine must be kept at for vaccination to be successful.
An independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity; but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, inadequately resourced health facilities, also posed problems, as well as technical issues with the vaccine. In India, the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar district and Uttar Pradesh, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type 1) seroconversion response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, meanwhile, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the cold chain also played a role. Finally, in those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in transmission becoming re-established—namely Angola, Chad, and South Sudan, the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although low resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors were also identified as playing a role.
Two additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. In 99% of infections, polio is a mild condition that causes very few symptoms and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. And since 2000, there have been a number of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine, which have raised the necessity of eventually switching to the more expensive inactivated polio vaccine.
In a 2012 interview with Pakistani newspaper "Dawn", Dr. Hussain A. Gezari, WHO's special envoy on global polio eradication and primary healthcare, gave his views on obstacles to eradication. He said the biggest hurdle in making Pakistan polio-free was holding district health officials properly accountable—in national eradication campaigns officials had hired their own relatives, even young children. "How do you expect a seven-year-old thumb-sucking kid to implement a polio campaign of the government," said Dr Gezari. He added that, in spite of this, "the first national campaign was initiated by your government in 1994 and that year Pakistan reported 25,000 polio cases, and the number was just 198 last year, which clearly shows that the programme is working."
Opposition and aid worker killings.
One factor in the failure of polio immunization programs has been opposition by some opposition. This opposition has varied and is linked mostly to local political will rather than any religious orthodoxy. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Taliban have issued "fatwas" against polio vaccination.
After the September 11 attacks, a myth arose in Pakistan that the United States was using immunization campaigns to sterilize the local population. Health officials tried to dispel this story, but their efforts, in the opinion of Heidi Larson, writing in "The Guardian", were marred by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), when it conducted a fake Hepatitis B immunization campaign in Bin Laden's residence in Bilal Town at Abbottabad with the help of Dr. Shakil Afridi. The intention of the campaign was to confirm Osama bin Laden's presence in the city by obtaining DNA samples from children suspected of being his. In a letter written to CIA director Leon Panetta, the InterAction Alliance, a union of about 200 U.S.-based non-government organizations, deplored the actions of the CIA in using a vaccination campaign as a cover. Pakistan reported the world's highest number of polio cases (198) in 2011.
In early 2012, some parents refused to get their children vaccinated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) but religious refusals in the rest of the country had "decreased manifold".
Even with the express support of political leaders, polio workers have been kidnapped, beaten, and assassinated.
In February 2007, physician Abdul Ghani, who was in charge of polio immunizations in a key area of disease occurrence in northern Pakistan, was killed in a terrorist bombing.
In Pakistan in 2012, there was the killing of a polio worker in Gadap in October. In December 2012, a 3-day vaccination campaign sponsored by the United Nations agencies the World Health Organization and UNICEF in Pakistan was suspended following the murder of 9 vaccination workers.
The killing of polio workers seen the previous year continued in 2013. Seven clinic workers whose duties included vaccination were killed in Swabi, Pakistan on New Year's Day. The Pakistani government began providing police and paramilitary protection to a renewed vaccination campaign, but amid worries that this would inspire hostility, some escorts have been refused. Both escorting officers and polio workers continue to be killed in Pakistan, where vaccination has been said to violate Islamic law. In February a pair of similar attacks in Nigeria killed nine female polio vaccinators following a local cleric's condemnation of vaccination. The security situation in Afghanistan improved in May when the Afghani Taliban announced it would support polio eradication, pledging to do nothing to hinder the campaign as long as no foreigners were involved in the vaccinations. In December 2013, three polio workers were killed in northwest Pakistan and three more were killed in Karachi in January 2014.
Progress.
Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries. Czechoslovakia became the first country in the world to scientifically demonstrate nationwide eradication of poliomyelitis in 1960. In 1962—just one year after Sabin's oral polio vaccine (OPV) was licensed in most industrialized countries—Cuba began using the oral vaccine in a series of nationwide polio campaigns. The early success of these mass vaccination campaigns suggested that polioviruses could be globally eradicated. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), under the leadership of Ciro de Quadros, launched an initiative to eradicate polio from the Americas in 1985.
Much of the work towards eradication was documented by Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado, as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, in the book "The End of Polio: Global Effort to End a Disease".
1988–1991.
In 1988, the World Health Organization, together with Rotary International, UNICEF, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention passed the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, with the goal of eradicating polio by the year 2000. The Initiative was inspired by Rotary International's 1985 pledge to raise $120 million toward immunising all of the world's children against the disease. The last case of wild poliovirus poliomyelitis in the Americas was reported in Peru, August 1991.
1994–2000.
On 20 August 1994 the Americas were certified as polio-free. This achievement was a milestone in efforts to eradicate the disease.
In 1994 the Indian Government launched the Pulse Polio Campaign to eliminate polio. The current campaign involves annual vaccination of all children under age five.
In 1995 Operation MECACAR (Mediterranean, Caucasus, Central Asian Republics and Russia) were launched; National Immunization Days were coordinated in 19 European and Mediterranean countries. In 1998, Melik Minas of Turkey became the last case of polio reported in Europe. In 1997 Mum Chanty of Cambodia became the last person to contract polio in the Indo-West Pacific region. In 2000 the Western Pacific Region (including China) was certified Polio-free.
In October 1999, the last isolation of type 2 poliovirus occurred in India. This type of poliovirus appears to have been eradicated.
Also in October 1999, The CORE Group—with funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—launched its effort to support national eradication efforts at the grassroots level. The CORE Group initiated this initiative in Bangladesh, India and Nepal in South Asia, and in Angola, Ethiopia and Uganda in Africa.
2001–2004.
[[File:Poliomyelitis world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Disability-adjusted life year for poliomyelitis per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
By 2001, 575 million children (almost one-tenth the world's population) had received some 2 billion doses of oral polio vaccine. The World Health Organization announced that Europe was polio-free on June 21, 2002, in the Copenhagen Glyptotek.
In 2002, an outbreak of polio occurred in India. The number of planned polio vaccination campaigns had recently been reduced, and populations in northern India, particularly from the Islamic background, engaged in mass resistance to immunization. At this time, the Indian state Uttar Pradesh accounted for nearly two-thirds of total worldwide cases reported. (See the 2002 Global polio incidence map.) However, by 2004, India had adopted strategies to increase ownership of polio vaccinations in marginalized populations, and the immunity gap in vulnerable groups rapidly closed.
In August 2003, rumors spread in some states in Nigeria, especially Kano, that the vaccine caused sterility in girls. This resulted in the suspension of immunization efforts in the state, causing a dramatic rise in polio rates in the already endemic country. On June 30, 2004, the WHO announced that after a 10-month ban on polio vaccinations, Kano had pledged to restart the campaign in early July. During the ban the virus spread across Nigeria and into 12 neighboring countries that had previously been polio-free. By 2006, this ban would be blamed for 1,500 children being paralyzed and had cost $450 million for emergency activities. In addition to the rumors of sterility and the ban by Nigeria's Kano state, civil war and internal strife in the Sudan and Côte d'Ivoire have complicated WHO's polio eradication goal. In 2004, almost two-thirds of all the polio cases in the world occurred in Nigeria (760 out of 1,170 total).
2005.
There were 1,979 cases of wild poliovirus (excludes vaccine derived polio viruses) in 2005. Most remaining polio infections were located in two areas: the Indian subcontinent and Nigeria.
Eradication efforts in the Indian sub-continent have met with a large measure of success. Using the Pulse Polio campaign to increase polio immunization rates, India recorded just 66 cases in 2005, down from 135 cases reported in 2004, 225 in 2003, and 1,600 in 2002.
Yemen, Indonesia and Sudan, countries that had been declared polio-free since before 2000, each reported hundreds of cases—probably imported from Nigeria. On May 5, 2005, news reports broke that a new case of polio was diagnosed in Java, Indonesia, and the virus strain was suspected to be the same as the one that has caused outbreaks in Nigeria. New public fears over vaccine safety, which were unfounded, impeded vaccination efforts in Indonesia. In summer 2005 the WHO, UNICEF and the Indonesian government made new efforts to lay the fears to rest, recruiting celebrities and religious leaders in a publicity campaign to promote vaccination.
The first case of the polio outbreak in Sudan was detected in May 2004. The reemergence of polio led to stepped up vaccination campaigns. In the city of Darfur, 78,654 children were immunized and 20,432 more in southern Sudan (Yirol and Chelkou).
In the United States on September 29, 2005, the Minnesota Department of Health identified the first occurrence of vaccine derived polio virus (VDPV) transmission in the United States since OPV was discontinued in 2000. The poliovirus type 1 infection occurred in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant girl aged 7 months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were not vaccinated for polio.
2006–2010.
In 2006 only four countries in the world (Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) were reported to have endemic poliomyelitis. Cases in other countries are attributed to importation. A total of 1,997 cases worldwide were reported in 2006; of these the majority (1,869 cases) occurred in countries with endemic polio. Nigeria accounted for the majority of cases (1,122 cases) but India reported more than ten times more cases this year than in 2005 (676 cases, or 30% of worldwide cases). Pakistan and Afghanistan reported 40 and 31 cases respectively in 2006. Polio re-surfaced in Bangladesh after nearly six years of absence with 18 new cases reported. "Our country is not safe, as neighbours India and Pakistan are not polio free", declared Health Minister ASM Matiur Rahman. (See: Map of reported polio cases in 2006)
In 2007 there were 1,315 cases of poliomyelitis reported worldwide. Over 60% of cases (874) occurred in India; while in Nigeria, the number of polio cases fell dramatically, from 1,122 cases reported in 2006 to 285 cases in 2007. Officials credit the drop in new infections to improved political control in the southern states and resumed immunisation in the north, where Muslim clerics led a boycott of vaccination in late 2003. Local governments and clerics allowed vaccinations to resume on the condition that the vaccines be manufactured in Indonesia, a majority Muslim country, and not in the United States. Turai Yar'Adua, wife of recently elected Nigerian president Umaru Yar'Adua, made the eradication of polio one of her priorities. Attending the launch of immunization campaigns in Birnin Kebbi in July 2007, Turai Yar'Adua urged parents to vaccinate their children and stressed the safety of oral polio vaccine.
In July 2007, a student traveling from Pakistan imported the first polio case to Australia in over 20 years. Other countries with significant numbers of wild polio virus cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which reported 41 cases, Chad with 22 cases, and Niger and Myanmar, each of which reported 11 cases.
In 2008, 19 countries reported cases and the total number of cases was 1,652. Of these, 1,506 occurred in the four endemic countries and 146 elsewhere. The largest number were in Nigeria (799 cases) and India (559 cases): these two countries contributed 82.2 percent of all cases. Outside endemic countries Chad reported the greatest number (37 cases).
In 2009, a total of 1,606 cases were reported in 23 countries. 1,256 of these were in the four endemic countries, with the remaining 350 in 19 sub-Saharan countries with imported cases or re-established transmission. Once again, the largest number were in India (741) and Nigeria (388). All other countries had less than one hundred cases: Pakistan had 89 cases, Afghanistan 38, Chad 65, Sudan 45, Guinea 42, Angola 29, Côte d'Ivoire 26, Benin 20, Kenya 19, Niger 15, Central African Republic 14, Mauritania 13 and Sierra Leone and Liberia both had 11. The following countries had single digit numbers of cases: Burundi 2, Cameroon 3, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 3, Mali 2, Togo 6 and Uganda 8.
According to figures updated in April 2012, the World Health Organization reports that there were 1,352 cases of wild polio in 20 countries in 2010. Reported cases of polio were down 95% in Nigeria (to a historic low of 21 cases) and 94% in India (to a historic low of 42 cases) compared to the previous year, with little change in Afghanistan (from 38 to 25 cases) and an increase in cases in Pakistan (from 89 to 144 cases). 460 cases (34% of the global total) were reported from an acute outbreak in Tajikistan, which was associated with a further 18 cases across Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) and the Russian Federation, with the most recent case from this region being reported from Russia the 25th September. These were the first cases in the WHO European region since 2002. 441 cases (30% of the global total) were reported from an outbreak in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville). At least 179 deaths were associated with this outbreak, which is believed to have been an importation from the ongoing type 1 outbreak in Angola (33 cases in 2010) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (100 cases).
2011.
In 2011, cases were reported in the four endemic countries—Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria and India—as well as in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Angola, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), Niger, and Gabon. Almost 87 percent of all cases seen this year came from five countries: Pakistan, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Nigeria. In India, only 1 case of wild poliovirus was reported—a remarkable feat in a country that in many recent years has had a plurality or majority of the world's polio cases.
Since the start of 2010 there had been 14 outbreaks of polio, several continuing into 2011. Amid political instability, Côte d'Ivoire reported 36 cases of type 3 polio as part of an ongoing outbreak, with type 3 cases also in neighboring Mali and Guinea. Polio transmission recurred in Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kenya reported its first case since 2009, while China reported 21 cases, mostly among the Xinjiang Uygur of Hotan prefecture, the first cases since 1994. Although the situation in Northern Nigeria improved, concerns exist about further outbreaks there because of its central location.
The situation in Pakistan is complex. The lowest number of cases reported in one year was 32 in 2007. In 2011, Pakistan reported 198 cases. The remaining focuses lie in three parts of Pakistan: Balochistan Province, Karachi and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. About 25% of children in Karachi are unvaccinated against polio; in Balochistan ~50% are unvaccinated. In contrast in Afghanistan the unvaccinated rate is ~10%. The difficulty in Pakistan appears to be a lack of trust in the health workers trying to vaccinate the children, fueled partly by the CIA using fake vaccination campaigns as a cover to gather DNA samples from Osama Bin Laden's relatives.
At end of 2011 the WHO recorded a total of 650 cases worldwide. 310 of these were considered to be part of outbreaks. 16 countries recorded cases. Pakistan had the greatest number (198). Six other countries recorded numbers in double digits: Chad: 132 cases; Democratic Republic of Congo: 93; Afghanistan: 80; Nigeria: 61; Côte d'Ivoire: 36; and China: 21. The remaining countries were: Mali: 7; Angola: 5; Niger: 5; Central African Republic: 4; Guinea: 3; Congo: 1; Gabon: 1; India: 1; and Kenya: 1.
2012.
Several countries surpassed a year since their most recent reported case of polio. Most notably, the WHO reported that on January 13, India completed its first polio-free year and is now polio-free, leaving only three countries worldwide that have remained afflicted by endemic poliomyelitis. Other countries that in 2012 surpassed a year since a reported case the previous year were Gabon and Congo (January), Mali (June), Côte d'Ivoire, Angola and Kenya (July) and Guinea (August), China (October), and Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (December). All those previously-infected countries did not report a case in 2012. Reported cases were limited to five countries, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Chad and Niger, four of which had fewer cases compared to 2011.
Nigeria remains the only polio-endemic country in Africa. By the end of the year, the number of confirmed cases in Nigeria was 122, of which 19 were type 3, well in excess of the 62 total cases reported in 2011. 90% of these cases were reported from eight persistently endemic northern states: Borno, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara. The situation in northern Nigeria is complicated by ongoing security concerns, which are likely to hamper the polio eradication effort in this area. Nigeria also continues to represent the source of cases exported to neighboring countries.
Chad was one of only two non-endemic countries reporting polio cases in 2012, with 5 cases — all type 1. The last case was reported to have had onset on 14 June 2012. In 2011, Chad had reported 132 cases, representing a precipitous reduction in the Chad polio outbreak. A single instance of type 1 polio occurred in Niger in November. Characterization of the virus suggested importation from Nigeria, but it is thought to have circulated locally, undetected, for some time.
Pakistan remains the Asian country with the highest number of cases, but also has seen a significant reduction. By the end of 2012, 58 cases were reported, compared to 198 at the same time in 2011. Pakistan is the last remaining locus of type 3 outside Nigeria, having two reported cases, plus one type 1/3 hybrid. Two-thirds of all cases occurred in Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. In the previous year, 198 cases were reported, indicating an improvement in spite of July fatwas from several Pakistani Islamist groups prohibiting vaccination.
Afghanistan also saw a significant reduction in cases, with 37 cases reported by the end of the year, compared to 80 reported in 2011.
The total number of wild-virus cases reported was 223. Of these Nigeria reported 122, Pakistan 58, Afghanistan 37, Chad 5 and Niger 1. Several additional countries, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Yemen, saw outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polio. In all there were 291 reported polio cases, the smallest number for any year on record.
2013.
Of the three countries in which polio is endemic, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the latter two have had significantly fewer cases in 2013 than reported by the same time the previous year. An ongoing outbreak centered on Bara in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, where vaccination has been difficult, represents the major reservoir for the virus in Asia, affecting both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, where there have been no cases in the tradition endemic region in the south. A growing outbreak in the Horn of Africa, centered in Banadir, Somalia, represents more than half of the year's total cases, the only wild cases in non-endemic countries reported in 2013. These have overwhelmed the gains made in endemic countries and by September the total number of polio cases surpassed that of the entire previous year. There have also been cases in Kenya, Ethiopia and Syria. By 26 November, 347 wild-virus cases had been reported, compared to 202 cases in 2012 reported by 27 November. Of these, cases in endemic countries have dropped from 197 to 123 while those in non-endemic countries have risen from 5 to 224. Circulating vaccine-derived cases have also been reported in the three endemic countries, as well as Somalia, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. India completed two years without a new polio case, needing one more year before it can be certified polio-free.
The sole remaining country in 2012 classified with reestablished transmission, Chad, has passed more than a year since its last wild-virus case, although it is still suffering from an outbreak of vaccine-derived virus. No type 3 cases have been reported in 2013. The last reported type 3 case of polio, world-wide, had its onset 11 November 2012 in Nigeria; the last wild case outside Nigeria was in April 2012 in Pakistan, and its absence from sewage monitoring in Pakistan suggests that active transmission of this strain has ceased there.
An ongoing outbreak centered on Bara in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan represents the major reservoir for the virus in Asia. Vaccination was banned by local leaders in North Waziristan from June, 2012, and the situation has been called alarming. It is also affecting neighboring Afghanistan. Major progress there has resulted in no reported cases in the tradition endemic region in the nation's south. Rather, all cases in Afghanistan in 2013 have been in the northeast and represent spillover from the Pakistani outbreak.
The year's biggest setback came in the Horn of Africa. Somalia had been free of wild polio since 2007 but had low levels of vaccination that put the nation at risk of reintroduction, and in April a case of polio in Mogadishu was found to be due to a wild polio strain of Nigerian origin. This came in spite of successful local negotiations the previous year that had allowed access to some populations for the first time in three years and a vigorous vaccination campaign already underway in this area, stricken by an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived polio ongoing since 2011 that had also spread to neighboring Kenya and Yemen. The outbreak of wild polio spread to Dadaab, Kenya, home to a large camp hosting Somalian refugees. Intensive targeted vaccination efforts in both Mogadishu and Dadaab, as well as more broadly in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Yemen were instituted, but 48 cases caused by wild virus were reported in Somalia and Kenya by early July, and cases have begun to appear in south-central Somalia, where security considerations have compromised vaccination activities for three years. By October, over 170 cases had been reported in Somalia, with more than a dozen in Kenya and cases in the Somali Region of Ethiopia.
Routine sewage monitoring has revealed the virus in another region that had been polio-free. In late 2012, a PV1 virus strain of Pakistani origin was detected in Cairo, raising fears of reintroduction that sparked a major vaccination push in the city in 2013. No actual cases of polio were reported there, but the Cairo strain was later detected in Rahat, Israel in April 2013, and subsequently in Beer Sheba, Kiryat Gat and Ashdod. It has subsequently been detected across the country, indicating a prolonged, widespread transmission. Again, no cases of the disease have been found, and while a large-scale outbreak in Israel is thought unlikely due to their program of routine vaccination and high immunity levels, there is thought to be a moderate-to-high risk of further international spread.
In October and November, World Health Organization confirmed 17 cases of polio in Syria, where immunization rates have dropped significantly because of the civil war. As many as a dozen additional cases await confirmation. It was the first outbreak there in 14 years. DNA testing revealed the strain to be most closely related to that found in Egypt, and ultimately traces to Pakistan.
In late April, the WHO announced a new $5.5 billion, 6-year cooperative plan (called the 2013–18 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan) to eradicate polio from its last reservoirs. The plan calls for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries. It also dictates a switch to inactivated virus injections, to avoid the risk of the vaccine-derived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the live-virus oral vaccine. In May, Bill Gates announced at the Global Vaccine Summit that total commitments to date stood at $4 billion or 73% of what is needed. This included pledges from Canada ($250 million), Britain ($457 million), Germany ($250 million), Norway ($240 million), Ireland ($6.65 million), Australia ($75.5 million), the Islamic Development Bank ($227 million) as well as the Gates foundation ($1.8 billion) and other philanthropists ($335 million).
2014.
On March 27, 2014 the WHO announced the eradication of poliomyelitis in the South-East Asia Region, in which the WHO includes eleven countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. With the addition of this region, the proportion of world population living in polio-free regions has reached 80%. The last case of wild polio in the South-East Asia Region was reported in India on 13 January 2011.

Ataxioceras

Ataxioceras is an extinct Ammonite cephalopod genus confined to the Upper Jurassic of Europe, included in the superfamily Perisphinctaceae. 
Previously "Ataxioceras" was assigned to the Perisphinctidae but has now been placed in the Ataxioceratidae for which it is the type genus. 
These fast-moving nektonic carnivores lived during the Jurassic period, from 161.2 to 150.8 Ma. 
Description.
The shell is evolute, strongly ribbed and miderately umbilicate. Primary ribs, on the order of 32 -36 per whorl, are sharp and widely spaced, originate at the unbilical shoulder. Secondary ribs form about mid flank, generally by trifurcation, but sometimes quadrafurcation (splitting into threes or sometimes fours) of the primaries. The umbilicus is about 0.4 the shell diameter. 
Distribution.
Fossils of species within this genus have been found in the Jurassic sediments in France, India and Romania.

Zack Addy

Zachary Uriah "Zack" Addy, Ph.D is a fictional character in the television series "Bones". He is portrayed by Eric Millegan. The character was introduced as Dr. Temperance Brennan's brilliant young assistant at the beginning of the series before he received his doctorate in Forensic Anthropology in the series' second season and became a forensic anthropologist. Millegan was a series regular for the first three seasons, appearing in all episodes. Since then, he has made three guest appearances in Season 4's "The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond" and "The End in the Beginning" (dream sequence) and Season 5's "The Parts in the Sum of the Whole" (flashback).
Character history.
Coming from a large Michigan family with three brothers and four sisters, Zack is a former child prodigy, a genius with an I.Q. well above 163 and a supposed eidetic memory. It is revealed in the episode "The Boy in the Time Capsule" that Zack was physically bullied harshly all through high school by other boys. In another episode, "A Boy in a Tree," he is heard saying he "didn't have any friends" all through high school, and endured relentless physical and emotional abuse all through his school life. Additionally, it is revealed that Zack is an excellent singer. At the beginning of the show, he had started two doctorates—one in forensic anthropology, the completion of which is shown on-screen in the episode "Judas on a Pole", the other in applied engineering, the completion of which is referred to in "The Killer in the Concrete".
His specialty, just like Dr. Brennan, is in the analysis of remains, especially identifying cause of death and weapons from marks on skeletal remains. It is usually his task to remove the flesh from the bones, a process known as "maceration". Because of his tremendous intellect, he has a strong broad-based knowledge of many of the specialties in the Jeffersonian lab.
Zack's best friend is Jack Hodgins. Although it at first appears Hodgins and Zack are roommates, it is later revealed he rents the apartment over Hodgins' garage. Zack also carpools with Hodgins because he can neither drive a car nor ride a bike. He once made a comment to Booth that if Booth shared Zack's knowledge of structural engineering, he would be afraid to drive as well (Season 1 "The Man on Death Row"). In The Man in the Bear, Zack and Hodgins compete for the affections of a beautiful delivery lady until they realize in the end that she is actually a lesbian when she shows an attraction to forensic artist, Angela Montenegro.
Episodes towards the end of Season 1 reveal Zack's colleagues, especially Dr. Goodman, feel he has become too comfortable as Dr. Brennan's assistant and is therefore not completing any of his work towards his doctorate degrees to avoid having to move into a new position. Goodman and Hodgins conspire to make Zack less comfortable in his position to motivate him to complete his studies thus encouraging him to fulfill his potential of more than just an assistant.
Right before he was about to complete his doctorate, Zack asks the Jeffersonian's new forensics head, Dr. Camille Saroyan, if he can have a job working at the Jeffersonian. She replies she could not put him in front of a court to testify because people would not take him seriously. Zack then goes to ask Angela for fashion advice, and she gives him a complete makeover that includes a new haircut and suit. After completing his doctorate and getting the makeover from Angela, Zack again asks Cam for a job, and she gives it to him, saying "Who am I to break up the team?"
At the end of Season 2, Zack receives a request from the office of the President to ship out to Iraq. What his duties there would be is not revealed, and he only tells Hodgins and Booth about it. He is indecisive and asks Booth for advice as Booth "knows more about duty and honor than anyone else I know". He also turns down the offer to be the best man at Hodgins and Angela's wedding in case Zack decides to go to Iraq and is killed, because he does not want Hodgins' memories of the wedding to be tainted with sadness, but Zack is later seen at the wedding. It is revealed in the first episode of Season 3 Zack had just returned from a three-month stint in Iraq, having returned early because he "failed to assimilate."
In "The Pain in the Heart", the final episode of Season 3, Zack receives third-degree burns and massive tissue damage on both hands after an explosion in the lab. It is later revealed he was in fact working as the apprentice of the Gormogon, even though he is not the son of a widow, and the explosion was designed as a distraction so Gormogon could break into the lab and steal back the silver skeleton. Zack's weaker personality was easily manipulated by Gormogon so he believed his belief system irrefutable, even going as far as to divide the bones of a lobbyist killed by Gormogon's other apprentice among the 10,000 skeletons in the Jeffersonian's bone storage room called Limbo. However, Zack still maintained a loyalty to his friends. As pointed out by Bones, he was willing to injure himself to keep Hodgins safe. He gives up the location of Gormogon's house after Bones makes him realize his logic is faulty.
At the end of the episode, prosecutor Caroline Julian cuts Zack a deal. He pleaded guilty to killing the lobbyist and declared ""Non compos mentis"", thus committing him into a mental asylum rather than to prison.
Zack is no longer a regular character on the show, but series creator Hart Hanson said he may become a recurring character to provide consults to the team with "certain talents we can use in a 'Hannibal Lecter' kind of way."
The episode "The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond" reveals Zack is receiving psychological treatment from FBI psychiatrist Dr. Lance Sweets. It is also shown at least Hodgins and Angela have both been in contact with Zack during his internment. Hodgins is shown bringing him a mathematical riddle to solve. In his session with Sweets, Zack admits to feeling guilty for killing the lobbyist, but claims he was not actually crazy, arguing he committed the crime for what had appeared to be perfectly logical reasons at the time. "I was wrong, not delusional," he says. Sweets believes Zack should feel more guilty about killing the lobbyist and less about having been taken in by Gormogon's rhetoric.
Towards the end of the episode, Zack escapes from the institution. It is revealed he could have escaped at any time but did not feel it was necessary to do so until that particular moment. After helping his co-workers solve the case, he willingly returns to the institution with Sweets. While returned to the asylum, Zack tells Sweets that while he had helped Gormogon find the lobbyist, he himself had not actually stabbed him; in other words, Zack believes he killed the lobbyist, but from a legal standpoint he is considered only an accessory or co-conspirator. Sweets insists Zack change his story, but Zack refuses. He fears if his secret were to come out, he will find himself in prison, where he is sure to do very poorly. He reminds Sweets as Zack's therapist, he must not reveal his secret because if Sweets were to do so, he would be violating doctor-patient confidentiality. The episode closes with Zack behind bars at the institution and Sweets keeping his secret.
In the season 4 finale, Zack is considered a suspect when a man is murdered in a popular nightclub owned by Booth and Brennan. Zack is described by Vincent as "the type of moron who goes to jail for a murder he didn't commit", suggesting that, on some level, Booth knows Zack is innocent. At the end of the episode, it is shown that the entire thing was in fact a dream about an alternative timeline that Booth had while unconscious and part of a new book Brennan was writing.
Zack also returned in the hundredth episode of the show as a flashback to Booth and Brennan's first case together, although he has yet to return to the show in "reality".
Later on, Hodgins says that Zack will be in the asylum "forever", hinting that Zack would be in the asylum on a permanent basis and would never even be released into the general public. Also, in the episode "The He in the She," Hodgins tells a new intern, Vincent, that Zack would be locked up for the rest of his life.
Characterization.
Despite his intelligence, Zack is unsure of himself and though he has come up with crucial insights vital to some of the team's cases, he is unable to forcefully express his opinion to Dr. Brennan. This may be due to romantic feelings toward her. When he discovered Temperance's own Forensic Anthropology professor had become her lover, Zack repeatedly wondered aloud whether he might enter into a similar relationship with Dr. Brennan. He was quickly disabused of the notion by his colleagues. His inability to pick up on pop culture references or jokes was often a source of comedy in the show. Other characters, especially Booth and Hodgins, were often annoyed or turned off by his lack of social skills. Hodgins once called him a "dull Vulcan" in exasperation.
Zack appears to have an on and off-again relationship with "Naomi, in Paleontology", despite hints in the first season she was dissatisfied with his sexual prowess. In the third season, they accompany each other to the annual Jeffersonian Institute Halloween party, agreeing to dress as a cow (Naomi in front, Zack in back) ("The Mummy in the Maze") and in "The Parts in the Sum of the Whole" he talks about her again. Zack has no problem making inappropriate comments about others' personal lives, and has asked Agent Booth for advice on sex and women, requests which Booth characteristically ignored; and at one point threatened to ""take out gun and shoot [Zack between the eyes"" if he continued to ask him those questions. Angela answered his question once, (on one occasion even recommending him to ""reap the benefits of sexual wisdom""), and Hodgins gave him a pocket-sized "Kama Sutra" to help him out, revealed in the season three finale ("The Pain in the Heart").
Very little is known about his childhood. In "The Wannabe in the Weeds" episode from the third season, it was discovered Zack was in singing classes during his childhood as a way for his parents to help integrate him socially. Though it did not appear to work, he demonstrates his talent when Hodgins doubted him. He has fond memories of receiving his first microscope ("The Girl with the Curl"), and when he was six, he had a pirate eyepatch, ("The Man with the Bone"). He said he used to play horses as a child and has a Michael Jackson glove. It is also known he attended a private high school ("A Boy in the Tree"). His interests include model airplanes ("The Killer in the Concrete"), watching basketball ("The Soldier on the Grave"), and science fiction: "Firefly" ("The Man in the Fallout Shelter"), "Lord of the Rings" ("The Woman at the Airport"), "Star Wars", "Star Trek", "Stargate", "Battlestar Galactica" ("The Superhero in the Alley"). He does not dance, because he's been told he ""looks like a marionette in a windstorm"" (The Man in the Wall).
Although well-meaning, helpful, and friendly, when a situation calls for social interaction or intuition, he is often lost. Further evidence of his social ineptitude can be seen in the frequent, on-screen coaching in social matters he gets from Jack and Angela. He is very literal-minded, and is often confused by colloquial expressions or metaphor, despite his high intelligence. His attempts to use such expressions meet with mixed success, such as referring to a skull he'd cleaned as being ""clean enough to eat off of"" ("Two Bodies in the Lab").
In the episode "The Killer in the Concrete", Booth is on the phone with Zack and Dr. Brennan while looking for "Icepick" at a model airplane enthusiasts gathering. Unaware of Zack's interest in planes, Booth comments every "airplane freak" in the area was at the event, and Zack corrects him by saying the enthusiasts prefer to be called "pilots." Zack mentions forensic anthropology is only one of his areas of study, another is applied engineering, and he is extremely adept in practical aeronautics.
As seen in the episode "The Man in the Fallout Shelter" Zack has a large family and greatly values them, remarking the true meaning of Christmas is ""Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews; 40 people who love you and are happy to see you"." Also in the first season, he reveals to Dr. Brennan he uses his vacation time to visit his family. While he does not necessarily enjoy these visits, he goes because they love him ("The Man in the Wall").
Even in the asylum, Zack apparently still has some degree of contact with his old colleagues, Hodgins occasionally visiting him with puzzles for him to solve and Sweets having formed a diagnosis of Zack (although he is unable to reveal that Zack is not "actually" 'crazy' due to doctor/patient confidentiality); Booth's dream sequence in "The End in the Beginning" implies that Booth is aware on some level that Zack is innocent, but this has never been explored in the real world.

Lansdowne Bridge Rohri

The Lansdowne Bridge Rohri () is a former railway bridge over the Indus River in Pakistan.
A marvel of 19th-century engineering, the 'longest 'rigid' girder bridge in the world' at that time, it was begun in 1887. It was designed by Sir Alexander Meadows Rendel; the girder work, weighing a massive 3,300 tons, was manufactured in London by the firm of Westwood, Baillie and erected by F.E. Robertson, and Hecquet. 
The Indus Valley State Railway had reached Sukkur in 1879 and the steam ferry that transported eight wagons at a time across the Indus between Rohri and Sukkur was found to be cumbersome and time consuming. The ferry link became redundant when Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay, deputizing for Lord Lansdowne the viceroy, inaugurated the Bridge on March 25, 1889.
As summer comes early to Sukkur and the heavy European-style uniforms of the time would have been uncomfortable, the opening ceremony took place early in the morning. At the ceremony, Lord Reay unlocked a highly ornamental padlock (designed by J.L. Kipling, CIE, Principal of the Mayo School of Art in Lahore and father of Joseph Rudyard, the famous poet and author) which held shut the cumbersome iron gates guarding entry to the bridge. The gathered dignitaries then walked across the bridge and adjourned to breakfast followed by toasts under a shaman (Berridge 1967:128). The bridge provided the railway link between Lahore, in the heart of the granary of British India, and the port of Karachi on the Arabian Sea. 
When the great steel Ayub arch was constructed (1960–1962), railway traffic was shifted there. About a hundred feet apart, the two bridges seem like one from a distance. The Ayub arch became the world's third longest railway arch span and the first bridge in the world to have "the railway desk slung on coiled wire rope suspenders." The consulting engineer was David B. Steinman of New York, proponent of 'vocational aesthetics'. It cost about two crore rupees and the foundation stone was laid on December 9, 1960. It was opened by President Muhammad Ayub Khan on May 6, 1962.

Michael Zorc (born 25 August 1962) is a German retired footballer who played as a central midfielder.
Nicknamed "Susi" in his early days because of his long hair, he spent his entire career with Borussia Dortmund, appearing in nearly 600 official games in 17 seasons. Subsequently, he went on to serve as the club's sport manager.
Football career.
Born in Dortmund, Zorc played 463 Bundesliga games for Borussia Dortmund (a club record) between 1981 and 1998, also being for many years the team's captain. He also ranked, at one time, the club's second all-time top goalscorer, thanks in part to his excellent penalty-taking ability. He made his professional debut on 24 October 1981 in a 0–2 away loss against SV Werder Bremen, becoming an automatic first-choice from his second season onwards.
The tail-end of Zorc's career saw also his greatest successes, as Dortmund were twice crowned national champions, as well as winning the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup. He scored in double digits in seven seasons, including 15 apiece from 1994–96.
Zorc played seven times for the German national team, but never made the squad for any international tournament. His debut came on 16 December 1992 at already 30, during a 1–3 friendly defeat with Brazil.
Upon retiring at nearly 36, Zorc became sports manager of Borussia Dortmund, still being in charge as the team won the national championship in 2002, 2011 and 2012.

Gene Tapia

Eugene "Gene" H. Tapia (March 16, 1925 – April 12, 2005) was an American race car driver from Mobile, Alabama. He competed in four NASCAR Grand National (now Sprint Cup Series) races, but he is best known for racing in the #327 supermodified. He was nicknamed the "King of the Supermodifieds."
Early life.
Tapia was born on March 16, 1925, in Mobile, Alabama, to Ada and Homer Tapia. When he was nine years old, he attended a dirt track race with his father. His father began taking him regularly to motorcycle races in the mid 1930s.
At the age of 17, Tapia got married. That same year, he was involved in a street fight and the county district attorney suggested that he should leave town to avoid prosecution. In order to resolve the matter amicably, he left Mobile to work as a civilian on a military base in Alaska. Tapia was wounded when the Japanese attacked Dutch Harbor in June 1942. 
While Tapia was away, his wife gave birth to a boy named Larry Eugene Tapia in September 1942 at Memphis, Tennessee. Before either parent was able to see the baby, he was stolen by Georgia Tann's baby theft ring that worked at the hospital. 
In June 1943, Tapia returned to Mobile where he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He served with the Third Marine Division in Guadalcanal, the first-day invasion of Guam, and spent over 35 days on Iwo Jima.
Racing career.
In 1948, Tapia began racing as a way to get past battle stress which plagued him after the War. Later that year, he won his first stock car race at Chisholm Fairgrounds in Montgomery, Alabama. He raced in several NASCAR races that season. During his brief time spent racing in NASCAR, he won the Florida state title and the 1953 Mississippi state title. He left the circuit because he wanted to race five nights per week instead of one night. "Tapia was right up there with the best," said Donnie Allison. "He could have made it real good in NASCAR, if he had chosen. But I think his regard for his family and the desire to race more frequently is what kept him closer to home."
Tapia won the 1968 and 1969 World 300 Supermodified race at Mobile International Speedway. The event was billed as the "world's richest supermodified race".
Later life.
In 1990, Tapia was able to meet his son. The 47-year-old, who was living in Missouri, was told that his parents had died in an automobile accident. Tapia died in 2005 at the age of 80.

Arcestes

Arcestes is an extinct ammonite cephalopod genus belonging to the Ceratitida. 
Description.
Their shells were broad and rounded, giving them an almost spherical appearance. Unlike many other ammonites, the shells of "Arcestes" lack keels that would otherwise stabilize them while swimming. Because of this, some paleontologists have suggested that they were bottom-dwelling crawlers.
The shell of "Arcestes" is globular or subglobular with periodic narrow transverse constrictions in internal molds due to periodic internal transverse ridges (variaces) in the shell. The suture is ammonitic with complexly subdivided elements. The ventral lobe is subdivided by a low median saddle. Lateral lobes and saddles have generally triangular outlines but are deeply embayed by strong projections forming tree-like patterns. They form a series diminishing in size and complexity in a rather straight line going from the venter to the umbilicus in the middle of the shell.
Distribution.
Fossils of "Arcestes" are found in Mid to Upper Triassic marine strata throughout the world, including California ("A. pacificus"), Nevada ("A (Anisarcestes) mrazici") and Austria ("A. intuslabiatus" and "A. binacostomus").

Upper Cervical Specific Chiropractic

Upper Cervical Specific Chiropractic is a branch of chiropractic developed and promoted by B. J. Palmer beginning in the 1930s until his death. According to Upper cervical chiropractic, a vertebral subluxation can only occur in upper cervical vertebrae. Therefore this technique places great importance on the anatomical structures of the atlanto-occipital joint, pointing out that it floats on two toed-in spoon like surfaces and is a potential source of instability. This potential instability of the atlanto-occipital joint is theorized to predispose people to an "adaptational imbalance" in the head/neck region.
Background.
This theory was brought to Palmer's attention by Al Wernsing, another chiropractor. Soon thereafter, Palmer abandoned his ties to traditional full-spine spinal adjustments and allowed only adjustments of the upper cervical vertebrae, a technique which he termed "Hole in one" (HIO). The technique was the only one to be taught during the remainder of his life at Palmer School of Chiropractic. Afterwards the school adopted the work of chiropractors Clay Thompson and Clarence Gonstead, but eventually labelled its technique curriculum the Palmer Package.
The techniques are characterised by:
1. Main influence on the upper cervical articulations of the occiput, and the atlas and axis vertebrae
2. Focus on vector calculation based upon the theory that kinematic joint dysfunction is related to a positional disturbance.
3. Attempted radiographic analysis of positional disturbance of the atlanto-occipital joint
4. Documentation of post-adjustment results with objective measures
5. Use of a specific vectored force
Subluxation.
According to Upper cervical chiropractic, a subluxation can only occur in upper cervical vertebrae. A subluxation must have the following components:
1. A vertebra out of alignment with its co-respondents above and below.
2. Occlusion of a foramen or foramina
3. Pressure upon nerves
4. Interference with transmission of the normal quality flow of mental impulse supply between brain and body
5. No vertebrae is subluxated unless it is off normal position in three directions and remains such (Vol. XVIII)
Literature.
Textbooks such as Eriksen's "Upper Cervical Subluxation Complex" argue for the technique on the basis of empirical evidence in private practice and a review of associated concepts in published literature.
A systematic literature review in 2001 found upper cervical techniques to be in the least effective group of treatments for low back pain among several chiropractic techniques reviewed.

Jack Hodgins (Bones)

Jack Stanley Hodgins IV, Ph.D. is a fictional character in the American television series, "Bones". He is portrayed by T. J. Thyne. Jack is introduced to the series primarily as an entomologist/forensic entomologist, but also as a botanist/forensic botanist, mineralogist/forensic mineralogist, a palynology/forensic palynologist, and a forensic chemist, but conspiracy theories are his hobby. During an investigation, he is primarily responsible for estimating time of death and examining trace evidence and particulates. Like his boss, Camille Saroyan, Hodgins is left-handed, as are both Tamara Taylor and TJ Thyne in real life. 
Background and Family.
Jack Hodgins comes from an extremely wealthy family of Swedish descent (as hinted by Angela in season two), and is the sole heir to the fictional private corporation known as the Cantilever Group, although he hid his wealth from his coworkers for a long time. 
The son of Jonathan and Anne, Hodgins was thought to have been an only child until he discovered in Season 9 that he had an older brother named Jeffrey who was institutionalized with schizoaffective disorder. It is stated in "The Blonde in the Game", that he had an uncle named Patrick. His grandfather served as a "code breaker" under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz during World War II. His family is the single largest donor to the Jeffersonian, although he would rather toil in academia than spend time in the high social society to which his wealth entitles him. In Season 8, after serial killer Christopher Pelant hacks into Hodgins' savings and drains his bank account, he and Angela are forced to scrimp. However, in Season 9, he tells Sweets that he is content as he still has his work at the Jeffersonian and family – the two things which he values the most. 
Hodgins, like Zack, was bullied in school: in elementary and middle school for being a "rich boy" and in high school for his small physical stature and diminished social skills. It is later noted that he "managed to stand up for himself" on the last day of senior year, which Sweets believes gave him closure.
According to Angela, in "The Truth in the Myth", in season 6, Hodgins is a Virgo, and of course because of this, he would "belittle astrology". His starsign puts his birthday somewhere between 23 August and 22 September.
Hodgins drives an original Mini, which Booth jocularly called a "toy car", although in later seasons he was seen driving a Toyota Prius as well. He is an experienced cave diver. 
Although a noted conspiracy theorist, Hodgins abandoned his paranoid thoughts and beliefs after it was revealed his best friend, Zack Addy, had become the most recent apprentice to a cannibalistic serial killer known as "Gormogon", due in part to Hodgins' complaints about secret societies potentially making Zack more susceptible to Gormogon's influence. Devastated by his best friend's poor judgment, as well as his recent break-up with Angela, Hodgins found his beliefs and feelings of paranoia turning into misanthropy. After being repeatedly confronted by Sweets about his behavior in the lab, Hodgins explained during a session that he "hates everybody". Sweets determines that the misanthropy was a way to cope with the overwhelming stresses in his life, and assured him that it will turn into something more pleasant in time.
In "Aliens in the Spaceship", in season 2, Hodgins brings up ""King of the Lab"" for the first time, he and Zack occasionally 'competing' for the title by trying to come up with particularly crucial items of evidence in the investigation. This tradition falls to the side due to the rotating interns of the following seasons, as Cam does not encourage it and Hodgins has varying connections with the interns. 
Later into season 8, Hodgins lost his money due to the machinations of killer and hacker Christopher Pelant, who hacked Hodgins' accounts while targeting a school in Afghanistan, forcing Hodgins to sacrifice his money so that the team could focus their efforts on stopping the destruction of the school. In "The Maiden in the Mushrooms", after using the last of Finn's late grandma's hot sauce, Hodgins figures out the ingredients, and opens a side business called "Opie and Thurston's" Hot sauce.
Work.
Hodgins has three doctorates, in entomology, botany, and geology/mineralogy. He is known around the Jeffersonian as the "bugs and slime guy" and Booth often calls him "bug boy", a reference to Hodgins' expertise and affection for all insects in general. During an investigation, he primarily deals with particulates and trace evidence and determines time of death by examining insect activity.
In later seasons, (4th(?) and beyond), Hodgins gets his own lab suite, known as the "Ookey Room", where he does most of his lab work, keeps his collection of Arthropods, and performs most of his experiments. There is a running gag in the show where he often pleads Cam, his boss, for "permission" to conduct a seemingly pointless and absurd experiment, sometimes to bizarre and amusing effect but still aids the investigation nonetheless. In episode 10 of season 4, "The Bones That Blew", Hodgins stated that his passion to "figure stuff out in amusing ways" was why he chose a career in science. In several episodes he has cooked using the lab apparatus, much to his co-workers' bemusement.
Characterization.
Hodgins is one of the more sarcastic members of the group, and initially deals with some anger management issues. He also had some initial difficulty in working with Dr Goodman, the Jeffersonian's administrator, as Dr Goodman frequently used conjecture or imagination to make inferences about the victims of crimes. He is sometimes "the funny man" with a notable impression of the character Seeley Booth.
In his earlier characterization, he was shown as having anger management issues; in the first season and in a flashback in season 5, Hodgins used to twang an elastic band on his wrist. 
Hodgins is one of the more socially adept "squints" and uses pop culture references and jokes, which Dr. Brennan and Zack Addy often fail to grasp. As such, he has little difficulty "translating" scientific terms into layman terms to Booth and is sometimes exasperated when Zack fails to understand a joke or quip. He and Zack had a friendly competition for distinction of "King of the Lab", awarded to whoever found the best lead in the case 
Throughout the series, Hodgins has been known for his "insane conspiracy ravings" and in many of the show's early episodes his knowledge of conspiracy theories was demonstrated. In several cases, Booth, despite his disdain for most of Hodgins' conspiracy theories, uses it to his advantage for a case; in the episode "The Girl in Suite 2103" he asks Hodgins to call the FAA with his "craziest" conspiracy theory in order to stall a plane so the FBI can get to it in time to do a search. Whenever different aspects of the government, such as the Department of Defense or the State Department, become involved in cases, Hodgins will often be the first to suggest that a cover-up is involved.
Relationships.
Romantic.
Angela Montenegro
After a few episodes of sexual tension, Hodgins takes Angela out on their first date to a park to play on swings. When he was buried alive with Dr. Brennan, Hodgins admitted to being in love with Angela, saying "I'm nuts about Angela. Over the moon, stupid in love with her." Hodgins proposed to Angela twice before she turned the tables and proposed to him after he told her that love was enough. Their wedding is cut short in the season two finale when a State Department official interrupts the ceremony, having conducted a background on him and Angela as both are federal employees and discovered that Angela is technically married to a Fijian man named Grayson Barasa.
Hodgins and Angela hire a private investigator to locate Angela's husband, and the investigator finds Angela's husband, Grayson Barasa, living on No Name Key in Florida. Hodgins and Angela ask Amber to force Grayson to sign the divorce papers. Grayson refuses to sign, claiming he still loves Angela and has even built a house for himself and her. Grayson is initially resistant to signing the divorce papers, which puts a strain on the relationship between Angela and Hodgins. They realize that they may not fully trust each other, and end their relationship.
After learning that Angela's father is in town (this is after their break-up), Hodgins awakes in the middle of a desert with a bandage on his shoulder, which he removes to reveal a tattoo of Angela's face along with the words "Angie Forever".
After time apart, it is made clear that Hodgins still has feelings for Angela. After Booth is hospitalized for a brain tumor near the end of Season 4, Hodgins proposes giving his and Angela's relationship a second shot. While, in Season 5, they seem to be just friends, there are still signs of romantic tension between the two. In the episode "The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken", Angela mentions to Hodgins that her required celibacy period will soon be over and seems to hint that she would like to break it with Hodgins; Hodgins turns her down, despite her insistence that she was implying no such thing. In "The X in the File", when Wendell tells Hodgins of his relationship with Angela, Hodgins is shown to be very upset and hurt. During the next episode, "The Proof in the Pudding", Angela has a pregnancy scare; during this time, Hodgins tells her that he loves her and that he will be there to support her and the baby. While the pregnancy test was revealed to be a false positive at the end of the episode, Angela still tells Hodgins that she is grateful for his support and will never forget it. They were later imprisoned in "The Witch in the Wardrobe" for a variety of minor infractions by a local sheriff, which led to remembrance of their happiness together. They both realized that they regretted breaking up and shared a passionate kiss. When a judge arrived to post their bail, they were finally married in a private ceremony in the jail cell. They announced their marriage to their colleagues soon after.
Upon their return from Paris, it is revealed that they are expecting their first child, who will be named Temperance after Dr. Brennan. Angela's father wants to name their child "Staccato Mamba". It came to him in a song. Hodgins disagrees so he stands up to him and tells him "No". Finally he agrees with Angela and Hodgins on the names Katherine Temperance for a girl and Michael Joseph for a boy. Also in the end of the episode it was revealed that Hodgins got a tattoo of Angela's dad on his other arm which said "Dad". In the episode "The Blackout in the Blizzard" Angela and Hodgins find out they are both carriers of Leber's Congenital Amaurosis, giving their baby a 25 percent chance of blindness. This was a huge devastation for the couple, but in the end they reminded each other that they can handle anything together. Once the child was born, their son was confirmed to not be blind, and the two named him Michael Staccato Vincent Hodgins (named in honor of Vincent Nigel Murray who was previously killed).
Colleagues.
Hodgins' argumentative nature sometimes annoys his co-workers but he is on friendly terms with most of the team, including the interns. He was close to Zack Addy and would advise him on how to behave in a social setting, sometimes with humorously awkward results. 
Of the interns, Hodgins is particularly close to Wendell Bray, Finn Abernathy and Arastoo Vaziri. He initially had an awkward relationship with Wendell as the latter once dated Angela for a period of time and Angela had painted Wendell nude once. They later resolve the issue over time. 
Hodgins adopts a more brotherly approach with Finn given their age difference and calls him "Opie" while Finn calls him "Thurston", likely a reference to Opie, a young boy in "The Andy Griffith Show" and crusty old millionaire Thurston Howell III from "Gilligan's Island". In Season 8 he unknowingly finishes Finn's favorite hot sauce, later revealed to be the last bottle made by his late grandmother. Feeling guilty, Hodgins attempts to molecularly recreate the sauce. He succeeds and starts a side business with Finn after getting a chef to endorse and market the hot sauce and they named the sauce "Opie & Thurston's Hot Sauce".
Hodgins and Arastoo frequently chat about sports, especially basketball and baseball, while examining remains in the lab. When Arastoo admitted to faking his accent as a cover for his religiousness, Hodgins was one of the first accept him without reservations after Arastoo explained how he reconciles his religion (Islam) with science.
When Booth was appointed the FBI liaison to the Jeffersonian, Hodgins, who is anti-bureaucracy, was particularly hostile to him, especially for the early part of Season 1. Booth's military background, position as an FBI agent and patriotism further added to the tension. In "Two Bodies in the Lab" Booth went against protocol and allowed Hodgins to go with him to rescue Dr. Brennan - albeit because Hodgins was the only person available to drive him to help Brennan - and their animosity subsides from then on. Despite their opposing views they are on friendly terms. Hodgins also asked for Booth's advice when he was planning to propose to Angela. Most notably, when Agent Perotta — who was officially working with the squints on a case where Booth was a prime suspect and thus unable to serve as the lead investigator — commented that 'her' people had found some recent evidence in the case, Hodgins, along with intern Wendell automatically corrected her statement by saying that the squints were "Booth's" people. After Brennan, Hodgins is the 'squint' who has spent the most time out in the field with Booth – discounting Dr. Camille Saroyan, who had prior experience working in law enforcement before joining the Jeffersonian – occasionally accompanying Booth when investigations require on-site particulate analysis.

Brian Horwitz

Brian Jeffery Horwitz, nicknamed "The Rabbi", (born November 7, 1982, in Santa Monica, California) is an American baseball outfielder who is currently a free agent. He has won two minor league batting titles and made his Major League debut in 2008.
Jewish heritage.
According to "Baseball Almanac", Horwitz was the 159th Jewish player to make the majors. Horwitz became the first Jewish player to play with the Giants since the – tenure of pitcher Jose Bautista, and the eighth since they moved to San Francisco. In , the New York Giants tried to trump up publicity by advertising Mose Solomon as "The Rabbi of Swat," playing across town from Babe Ruth, "The Sultan of Swat." Horwitz joined, among other Jewish major leaguers, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ian Kinsler, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis. Horwitz credited one set of grandparents for “instilling a lot of Jewish traits in our family.” “I still love my religion,” said Horwitz. He played in the JCC Maccabi Games when he was 15 and 16, leading his LA-area team to national titles in 1996 and 1997.
In 2009, he was one of the ballplayers honored in the fifth edition of Jewish Major Leaguers baseball cards.
Baseball career.
High school.
At Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino, California, Horwitz was Mission League MVP, All-Valley, and first team All-CIF Division I as a senior, batting .415. He helped lead his team to three straight league titles.
Summer leagues.
In the summer of 2001, he played for the Peninsula Oilers in the Alaska Baseball League, and in the summer of 2002 he played for the Hyannis Harbor Hawks, then known as the Hyannis Mets, in the Cape Cod League.
College (2001–04).
As a freshman right fielder for the University of California at Berkeley Bears, where he majored in American History, in he batted .310, and had a team-best 11 stolen bases. He had a school record 23-game hitting streak. He had 6 outfield assists on the season. He was an honorable mention Freshman All-American in Collegiate Baseball. As a sophomore in , he hit .266. In as a junior, he hit .347 with a team-leading 47 RBIs (including a school record 8 on February 14, 2003) and a .405 OBP and a .535 slugging percentage. He batted .400 with runners in scoring position, and was Pac-10 honorable mention and honorable mention Pac-10 All-Academic.
He was drafted in the 26th round by the Oakland Athletics in the June draft, but did not sign.
As a senior he dropped down to .288 and though he kept his OBP at .400, he wasn't drafted. "The two days of the draft were probably the worst two days of my life," he said. "I've kind of been doubted my whole career, and that's fine with me. It fuels the fire."
He had all the forms ready for chiropractic school, but he wanted the experience of playing pro ball for a half-summer, so he took the San Francisco Giants' offer of a uniform and $1,000 and signed as a non-drafted free agent in June of . "I used it to pay my phone bill," he said.
Minor leagues (2004–10).
Horwitz won two titles in two years in the minor leagues.
In 2004, Horwitz won the Northwest League batting title with a .347 average, the second-best in team history, playing for the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes in the Northwest League, and had a .407 OBP. He also earned a spot on the league All-Star team, led the league in hits (93), and set a franchise mark with 24 doubles.
In , he hit .349 (the 2nd-highest batting average of all minor leaguers with 400 or more at bats) for the Augusta GreenJackets in the South Atlantic League, and won his second consecutive batting title, while sporting a .415 OBP. He had 50 walks, while striking out only 39 times in 470 at-bats, and also led the league with 38 doubles. In addition, he had 8 outfield assists. He was also MVP of the 2005 California League Championship Series. "Baseball America" dubbed him the player with the best strike-zone discipline in the Giants' organization.
In , he spent nearly half the season at San Jose of the California League, where he hit .324 with a .414 OBP. He spent most of the rest of the season with the Double-A Connecticut Defenders, where he hit .286 with a .365 OBP, and ended the season with a handful of at-bats with the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies.
In , he was a non-roster invitee to the Giants' spring training, but the Giants ultimately assigned him to the Connecticut Defenders. In late May, he was promoted to the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies. He hit .326 for the Grizzlies with a .383 on-base percentage in 84 games.
The "2008 Baseball Prospect Handbook" said:
"all he does is spray hits wherever he plays. He won batting titles in his first two seasons, and didn't slow down once he hit Triple-A Fresno last year, hitting .326 after a mid-season promotion. Every manager for whom he has played has become his biggest fan. Horwitz has a great two-strike approach, loves the opposite field, and doesn't strike out, despite a swing that can get a bit long and choppy. He ... is better suited defensively for left field... it's hard to find a more dedicated worker..."
Horwitz started with Fresno, and was hitting .294 with a .351 OBP in 44 games when he was called up to the major leagues. In 2009 with Fresno he batted .290 with 10 doubles, 4 home runs, and 26 RBIs in 76 games before his season was cut short with a left rib cage muscle strain.
In his minor league career through 2009, Horwitz had a .316 batting average, .387 OBP, and in 2,104 at-bats had 130 doubles, 279 RBIs, 223 walks, and 243 strikeouts.
In the December 2009 Triple-A phase of the Rule 5 draft, the Giants lost Horwitz, who was claimed by the Cleveland Indians with the fourth pick of the draft. "This is good for him. I'm happy for him," Giants vice president of player personnel Dick Tidrow said. "He's a good kid. He's a good hitter and needs a change of scenery. He did good things for us and himself. Now he's reborn. He can go over there, show his stuff and maybe get back to the big leagues." "He's a right-handed-hitting corner outfielder, something we have a need for, obviously," John Mirabelli, the Indians' assistant general manager in charge of scouting said. "He can handle the bat. He did pretty well in a small sample in the big leagues. He'll go to Columbus and give us some depth where we need it."
In 2010, Horwitz played in spring training with the Indians, and then in six games for Cleveland's AAA team before he was released on April 20.[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/horwibr01.shtml][http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/453257]
Major leagues (2008).
Horwitz was a non-roster invitee to 2008 Giants spring training. In March, the Giants re-assigned him to their minor league camp.
On May 30, , the Giants purchased his contract from Triple-A when Dan Ortmeier went on the DL with a broken finger.
Horwitz hit his first major league home run on June 2, 2008, off New York Mets starting pitcher Óliver Pérez. He was mobbed in the dugout afterward. "There was a lot of love in that dugout," Horwitz said. "It adds to the experience. That's a great group of guys here and I just love being a part of this team." "Unbelievable," Horwitz said of his Major League experience. "It’s extraordinary, surreal. It’s an out-of-body experience. I’m really enjoying being here. How could you complain?"
After hitting .304 in his first 21 at-bats, Horwitz went 1-for-15 and was sent down to Fresno for more playing time on July 6, 2008.
Tools.
Horwitz is a pure hitter with excellent hand eye coordination, the ability to hit well for average, and doubles power. In 2007, "Baseball America" voted him as having the best strike zone discipline in the Giants minor league organization. He has solid defensive tools, good instincts, a quick first step, and a strong and accurate arm.

<doc id="9901859" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9901859" title="Bowling form">
Bowling form

In the sport of ten-pin bowling there are many different ways in which to deliver (known as a "throw" or "roll") the bowling ball in order to advance it toward the pins in an accurate and powerful manner.
Generally, there are three basic forms of 10-pin bowling. The most basic form is known as stroking, which is the most classic form. The most powerful form is known as cranking, which imparts great leverage and maximum rotation on the ball, but sacrifices accuracy. In between the two is the domain of the tweener, who has characteristics of both, but does not truly fit into either category. A well-known variant of "tweening" is the power stroker. Power stroking is often very similar to cranking and bowlers can often fit in either category, therefore bowlers that use one of these two styles are often simply known as power players.
A fourth style, known as helicopter, spinning, or UFO, is a style that is used to great effect in Asia. Finally, many modern bowlers have changed to a one- or two-handed no-thumb delivery.
Most of the various forms use different wrist and hand positions and rely on different timings and body positions to accommodate the differences in each style of release.
Conventional bowling form.
A conventional bowling form is the most commonly used method in 10-pin bowling. There are many styles that can be used in a conventional bowling form. However, all of the styles have one thing in common: the method in which to achieve a strike.
The following describes a strike for a right-handed bowler. A strike in conventional bowling is a specific method of knocking down all of the pins on the first ball. A conventional strike is when the ball utilizes the one-three pocket. A "pocket" is the area fronting the one and three pins.
There is an infinite number of ways a bowler can achieve a strike. However, the goal for a bowler on every first ball is to achieve a strike using the method that generates the highest strike percentage. A "perfect strike" is a strike where the ball hits only four pins: the one, three, five and nine pins. The ball enters the one-three pocket, and then falls into the pit area to the right of where the eight pin previously stood.
Stroking.
A stroker is a type of player in ten-pin bowling who releases his or her bowling ball in a smooth manner. They typically have rev rates less than 300 rpm. Strokers often keep their shoulders square to the foul line and their backswing generally does not go much above parallel to the ground. This type of release reduces the ball's rate of revolution, thus decreasing its hook potential and hitting power. Strokers rely on finesse and accuracy, as opposed to crankers, who use speed and power. However, today's modern reactive resin bowling balls now allow strokers to hit the "pocket" at a relatively high angle. Stroking is considered the most classic of all the bowling forms and is still the most popular style of bowling in the PBA. 
Although crankers are often considered to be more impressive to watch, strokers are often considered to have more repeatable and accurate shots. Strokers rely on smooth ball placement more than kinetic energy to fell pins. The all-time leader in titles and bowling earnings in the United States, Walter Ray Williams, Jr., is a stroker (though some consider his style unique and not easily classifiable). Other famous strokers include Norm Duke, David Ozio, and Dick Weber.
Several high-profile left-handed bowlers, such as Earl Anthony, Mike Aulby, Parker Bohn III and Mike Scroggins, are or were strokers, which has led to a stereotype in the bowling community that most left-handers are strokers who can only play the outside part of the lane.
"Tweening".
A tweener (a term derived from "in-between") is a bowler that delivers the ball in a manner that falls somewhere in between stroking and cranking. They have rev rates between 300 and 370 rpm. This modified delivery could use a higher backswing than is normally employed by a pure stroker or a less powerful wrist position than a pure cranker. Some use the term to refer to a bowler who is simply not a "picture perfect" example of either a stroker or a cranker.
Notable tweeners include Brian Voss (primarily a stroker, but not "picture perfect"), Mika Koivuniemi (primarily a stroker, but with a high backswing), and Doug Kent (considered by some to be a power stroker).
Power Stroking.
A variation on tweening is used by a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It can also be used to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).
Cranking/Power Player.
A cranker or power player is a bowler who strives to generate revolutions using a cupped wrist or excessive wrist action. They have rev rates over 370 rpm. Crankers who rely on wrist action may have a high backswing and open their shoulders to generate ball speed. These bowlers often cup the wrist, but open the wrist at the top of the swing. Crankers may also muscle the ball with a bent elbow because their wrist is not strong enough to be cupped at the release. Crankers often use "late" timing, where the foot gets to the foul line before the ball; a technique known as plant and pull, hardly using any slide on their final step and pulling the ball upwards for leverage. The timing between the feet and the ball being delivered is only a fraction of a second. Even though the plant and pull bowler is sometimes used as another name for a cranker, it is rather misleading because some crankers slide more, while bowlers with other styles can also use this technique. The term "cranking" is used to describe the style of release and heavy wrist action that typifies crankers. Because of the high rev rate and power crankers have, they can throw powerful strikes even on less-than-perfect hits, but are more prone to splits rarely left by strokers or otherwise. Because many bowlers have a style that can be described as a cranker or a power stroker, the term "power player" is used for any bowler who can generate high revolutions or ball speed.
Crankers sometimes stand to the extreme opposite side of the approach (relative to their target), and roll the ball over the middle lane boards out toward the gutter, using high revolutions to hook the ball back toward the pocket; this line is called "deep inside", "coast to coast", or "hooking the whole lane". Depending on the bowling ball, lane condition and bowler, the ball may exhibit either a rounded hook pattern or a later, more severe hook pattern known as skid-snap.
Some crankers use a low backswing but have a cupped wrist in order to generate high revolutions; this was the "old-fashioned" way of cranking. Notable bowlers with such a style include Jim Godman, Bob Learn, Jr., Ryan Shafer, Kelly Coffman, and Bob Vespi. Mark Roth was among the first bowlers to crank the ball using a high backswing and excessive wrist action. Other bowlers who followed this style include Amleto Monacelli and Jason Couch. Robert Smith, Mike Fagan, and Tommy Jones are often considered crankers due to their high backswings and RPM rates, but each has a smooth release and slide, so they can also be classified as power strokers.
The myth that crankers are not good spare shooters is not always supported. Roth, for example, was one of the best spare shooters on tour in his day, and was the first person to convert the nearly-impossible 7-10 split on national television. Robert Smith and Jason Couch both post very high spare-conversion percentages.
Spinning.
Spinners use a style of release known variously as spinning, helicopter, or UFO. Regardless of what it's known as, a spinner releases a ball such that it is rotating along a horizontal axis (the x-axis) in a counter clockwise motion (right-hander) as it moves down the lane. Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the pin rack, and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown in one of the three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane. A hook needs friction, in order to allow the ball to "grab" the lane. In spinning, very little of the ball's surface touches the lane, which is what the spinner intends. Spinning does not require friction of any kind.
The objective in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than "carry" (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes the right side of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as "riding the rail" among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.
Because spinners do not want the ball to grab onto the lane with its surface, they often use "plastic" bowling balls - balls with the older polyester cover-stock popular in the 1970s and 1980s, and commonly used as house balls today - in comparison to the widely used polyurethane, "particle" (polyurethane with nigh-microscopic glass spheres or other hard material throughout the coverstock) and "reactive resin" balls ("reactive resin" is itself polyurethane manufactured using a process to leave microscopic pores throughout it, essentially, a hard sponge) used by bowlers who desire a ball that will grip the lane and roll strongly. Additionally, because the chances of injury are somewhat elevated with this style of bowling, as well as the advantage of ball deflection with this style, the spinner will have a tendency to use lightweight balls between ten and twelve pounds.
Some hook bowlers can also spin and roll the ball at the same time, keeping the ball in-between the X and Y axis. This allows not only for carry of the pins, but also additional pin deflection for when the ball is off-target. Pete Weber, Tom Baker and Ryan Shafer of the PBA Tour, and Miki Nishimura of the JPBA are known to use this technique.
In tournaments within countries like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning can be an advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the foul line to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.
Other bowling forms.
No-Thumb Delivery.
A no-thumb delivery involves inserting only two fingers into the bowling ball, leaving the thumb on the outside of the ball, in an effort to create more revolutions and greater hook. Due to similar ball roll and revolutions to the cranker style, it is sometimes considered a variation of cranking. As the bowler does not use the opposite hand to support the ball, the wrist is often severely cupped and/or the ball is balanced on the forearm and delivered using a bent elbow throughout the shot. Another variation of this delivery is to palm the ball forcing the thumb to the side of the ball while forcing the elbow to lock so as to keep the arm straight and generate a back-swing. This variation leads to far greater consistency and straightens the ball out when needed. It also may require bowlers to use lighter bowling balls, resulting in less power and pin carry upon reaching the pin deck.
This technique is often used by casual or league-level bowlers who have not learned how to hook the ball using one of the more standard, thumb-in grips. Notable bowlers to use this technique at the professional level are Mike Miller and Bob Benoit.
Half-thumb variation.
The half-thumb variation is a technique employed by Tom Smallwood, the surprise winner of the 2009 "PBA World Championship", and involves putting the thumb in the ball only up to the first knuckle. Thus, the ball is thrown almost entirely with the fingers as a "no thumb" bowler would throw it, with the thumb only providing some control during the backswing. Smallwood also keeps two hands on the bowling ball until roughly midway through his approach.
Two-Handed Approach.
A Two-Handed Approach is a bowling technique whereupon the throwing hand is in the bowling ball and the opposite hand is also placed on the ball during the shot. This is an evolution of the one-handed no-thumb technique, where a bowler would generate similar revolutions but could not be as effective because their opposite hand does not support the ball through the approach. 
Traditionally, in two handed bowling, two fingers are inserted into the ball with the thumb left out. The dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the opposite hand is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate their hips more than a single handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 700 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what some top professional bowlers generate.
The two-handed approach should not be confused with the two-handed delivery. Just prior to the release of the ball, a bowler using a two-handed "approach" removes their supporting hand, effectively delivering the ball with only one hand. They are considered a one-handed bowler by sanctioning bodies, and must follow appropriate rules regarding switching dominant hands during competition. An actual two-handed "delivery" involves using both hands simultaneously to give force to the ball and is extremely rare in adult competition; it is mostly seen with young children first learning the game.
Notable bowlers with the two-handed approach style include Australian Jason Belmonte, Finn Osku Palermaa, and American pre-teen Chaz Dennis (the youngest person ever to bowl a 300 game). The bowling team of Bolivia is also noted for changing its bowlers to using the two-handed approach style.

Jean-Jacques Eydelie

Jean-Jacques Eydelie (born 3 February 1966 in Angoulême, Charente) is a French former footballer most noted for his role in the Marseille match-fixing scandal of 1993. A midfielder, Eydelie began his career with Nantes, before joining Marseille in 1992. His first season at Marseille was a success, with the club finishing top of the league, and winning the Champions League, but shortly after the Champions League final (in which Eydelie appeared as a substitute), it was revealed that he had contacted three players at Ligue 1 club Valenciennes (Jorge Burruchaga, Christophe Robert and Jacques Glassman) on behalf of the Marseille board, in order to offer bribes. Marseille needed to beat Valenciennes to secure the championship, and had induced the Valenciennes players to "go easy" in order that the Marseille players would not be overly exerted before the Champions League final. It was Glassman who reported the bribe, which resulted in Marseille being stripped of the 1993 French title, banned from defending the Champions League (although the win still stood), and relegated to Ligue 2. Eydelie was banned for a year by FIFA, given a one year suspended sentence, and served 17 days in prison. Members of the Marseille board were given longer prison sentences, and Valenciennes players Burruchaga and Robert received FIFA bans for their involvement. Upon his return to football, Eydelie had a nomadic career, he trained for a few months at Benfica, played in England, Switzerland and back in France before retiring in 2003. From 2006 to 2007 he was the manager of amateur club Limoges Foot 87.
In 2006, Eydelie released his autobiography, telling of corruption and doping during his time at Marseille. Former OM chairman Bernard Tapie sued unsuccessfully for libel (which he is planning to appeal), and former team mate Didier Deschamps has also threatened legal action.

Vertical axis wind turbine

Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are a type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set vertically and the main components are located at the base of the turbine. This arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, facilitating service and repair. VAWTs do not need to be pointed into the wind, which removes the need for wind-sensing and orientation mechanisms. Major drawbacks for the early designs (Savonius, Darrieus and giromill) included the significant torque variation during each revolution, and the huge bending moments on the blades. Later designs solved the torque issue by providing helical twist in the blades.
A VAWT tipped sideways, with the axis perpendicular to the wind streamlines, functions similarly. A more general term that includes this option is "transverse axis wind turbine". For example, the original Darrieus patent, US Patent 1835018, includes both options.
Drag-type VAWTs such as the Savonius rotor typically operate at lower tipspeed ratios than lift-based VAWTs such as Darrieus rotors and cycloturbines.
General aerodynamics.
The forces and the velocities acting in a Darrieus turbine are depicted in figure 1. The resultant velocity vector, formula_1, is the vectorial sum of the undisturbed upstream air velocity, formula_2, and the velocity vector of the advancing blade, formula_3.
formula_4
Thus the oncoming fluid velocity varies during each cycle. Maximum velocity is found for formula_5 and the minimum is found for formula_6, where formula_7 is the azimuthal or orbital blade position. The angle of attack, formula_8, is the angle between the oncoming air speed, W, and the blade's chord. The resultant airflow creates a varying, positive angle of attack to the blade in the upstream zone of the machine, switching sign in the downstream zone of the machine.
From geometrical considerations, the resultant airspeed flow and the angle of attack are calculated as follows:
formula_9
formula_10
where formula_11 is the tip speed ratio parameter.
The resultant aerodynamic force is resolved either into lift (F_L) - drag (D) components or normal (N) - tangential (T) components. The forces are considered acting at the quarter-chord point, and the pitching moment is determined to resolve the aerodynamic forces. The aeronautical terms "lift" and "drag" refer to the forces across (lift) and along (drag) the approaching net relative airflow. The tangential force acts along the blade's velocity, pulling the blade around, and the normal force acts radially, pushing against the shaft bearings. The lift and the drag force are useful when dealing with the aerodynamic forces around the blade such as dynamic stall, boundary layer etc.; while when dealing with global performance, fatigue loads, etc., it is more convenient to have a normal-tangential frame. The lift and the drag coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of the relative airflow, while the normal and tangential coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of undisturbed upstream fluid velocity.

William Kingston Flesher

William Kingston Flesher (June 10, 1825 – July 22, 1907) was a settler of southwestern Ontario, a militia officer, businessman and political figure. As well as founding the village of Flesherton, he represented the riding of Grey East in the Canadian House of Commons as a Conservative member from 1872 to 1878.
Early life.
Flesher was born in Kingston-upon-Hull, England in 1825, the eldest child of Rev. John Flesher, a Methodist preacher and Jane (née Cawood) Flesher. He was educated and spent his formative years in England. After he married Jane Foster in 1847 at the age of 22, they emigrated to Canada West.
Settler.
Flesher first moved to Bolton, Ontario, where he helped to run a mill with his brother John. However, Flesher sensed that he would never make his fortune as an employee, and cast about for a better opportunity. The colonial government was granting 50-acre plots of land to settlers on the understanding that if the settler was able to clear twelve of the fifty acres within five years, the settler would be given free title to the entire plot. Flesher travelled north to the newly surveyed Artemesia Township in Grey County, and was settled on 50 acres of land at Artemesia Corners, the intersection of the Toronto-Syndenham and Durham Roads (later provincial Highways 10 & 4). He was only the second settler in the area, the first being Aaron Munshaw Jr., a former Reformer who had recently returned from exile after the failed Upper Canada Rebellion. Munshaw had been granted land on the east side of the Toronto-Sydenham Road straddling the Durham Road, and had built a small tavern at the intersection. Flesher's land grant was on the opposite side of the road.
Both men laid out the parts of their land grants as village plots, and sold them to tradesmen and others eager to move to the area. Flesher also built a saw mill and a grist mill on the nearby Boyne River, and eventually built a large house for his family.
As the area was settled, Flesher continued to be a prominent local figure, acting at various times as postmaster (1865–1867 and 1869–1872), magistrate, druggist, and even doctor. He was a vocal booster of the village, and convinced other businesses to settle in the area, and also organized a Masonic Lodge. In recognition of his contributions, the name of the settlement was changed to Flesher's Corners. In 1866, in response to the Fenian Raids, Flesher became captain of the local militia, No. 6 Company of the 31st Grey Regiment. In 1867, the settlement had grown to the point where a more "village-like" name was seen as desirable, and the name was changed to Flesherton. Flesher was also involved in local construction, and in 1868, for $565, was awarded the contract to rebuild Osprey School Section No. 9, a one-room school that had burned down the previous year.
In 1876, Flesher donated some of his land for construction of a permanent Methodist church. The red brick church was finished a year later, and dedicated on 18 November 1877 by Minister of Education Egerton Ryerson.
Politician.
Flesher served as Warden of Grey County (1855–1857, 1861–1862, 1865 and 1867), and Reeve of the village (1854–1865 and 1866–1878). In 1867, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature, but in 1872, as a Conservative, he was elected to the House of Commons as the first MP for the new riding of Grey East. He served in John A. Macdonald's Opposition, and was re-elected in 1874 before retiring in 1878 to make way for Thomas Simpson Sproule, the man who would marry his daughter Mary Alice in 1881.
Family.
Flesher and his wife Jane raised five children: 
Several other young Fleshers lived in the area, including Thomas, William and Jack. Although some assumed that these were W.K. Flesher's nephews or cousins, a popular local rumour of the time — fuelled by his many trips back to his native England — held that he actually had a second wife living in England, and these other Fleshers were actually his children.
Flesher's younger brother John lived in the Flesherton area for several years before moving to Orangeville, Ontario, where he served as the district's MPP in the Ontario legislative assembly for 4 years.
Death.
Flesher travelled back to England frequently — his wife's obituary says he returned more than 35 times. During one such visit in 1907, he died at the age of 82 in Carnarvon, Wales.
Flesher's wife Jane survived him by 4 years, dying in 1911. She was buried in Flesherton Cemetery beside her son William Henry. Although descendants of her daughters continued to live in the area, her older son John and his family had moved away from the area, and her younger son William Henry had died without sons, making Jane the last Flesher to live in Flesherton.

<doc id="9901946" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9901946" title="Diego Vigil Cocaña">
Diego Vigil Cocaña

Diego Vigil Cocaña (1799, Tegucigalpa, Honduras – 10 January 1845, Granada, Nicaragua) was a Central American politician. He was the last president of the Federal Republic of Central America (1839–40), during its disintegration. He was also chief of state of the federal states of Honduras (1829) and El Salvador (1836–37 and 1837–38).
Background and early political career.
Diego Vigil was the son of José Vigil Fernández and Josefa Cocaña Fábrega. He was related to the Central American Liberal leader, general and president, Francisco Morazán, and was among his closest fellow combatants. Vigil studied law at the University of León in León, Nicaragua, and was afterwards temporarily active as a lawyer and notary in Tegucigalpa.
In 1824 he was a member of the federal parliament. In 1826-27 he was governor of the province of Tegucigalpa, but after the occupation of that city by the troops of federal President Manuel José Arce, he was arrested. When Morazán reconquered Honduras, Vigil was freed.
As chief of state of Honduras.
After Morazán's victory in the Battle of Trinidad (10 November 1827), the Legislative Assembly of Honduras named Vigil vice-chief of state on 27 November 1827. Morazán later made him chief of state of Honduras (7 March 1829 to 2 December 1829).
During his term of office, the Legislative Assembly dissolved the religious communities in Honduras. Their goods passed to the state, and several monasteries and other buildings were occupied as public buildings.
As chief of state of El Salvador.
General Morazán made him chief of state of the state of El Salvador, effective 1 February 1836. He served until 23 May 1837, and then again from 7 July 1837 to 6 January 1838.
During his administration a cholera epidemic broke out in El Salvador, spread by pilgrims returning from the shrine of Esquipulas. Because of the cholera, the government stopped all payments except for public employees, in order to devote the resources to fighting the epidemic. By January 1837, the cholera had spread to all the populations of the state. The state government established sanitary committees to meet in the capitals of the departments.
In March 1836 Licenciado and General Nicolás Espinoza, former chief of state of the state of El Salvador, was expelled from the state, and his title of "Benemerito de la Patria" was withdrawn.
On 8 January 1837, the Legislative Assembly passed the annual budget, totaling 85,028 pesos. It also authorized the introduction of water into the town of San Miguel.
On 23 May 1837 an insurrection of natives in Zacatecoluca and Cojutepeque broke out, with much killing and pillaging. On the same day, the office of chief of state passed from Vigil to Timoteo Menéndez. Vigil returned to office six weeks later, on 7 July.
In June 1837 a revolutionary movement erupted in Santa Ana, but it was suppressed. The government decreed amnesty for the participants in the various revolutionary movements.
On 6 January 1838, Timoteo Menéndez again became chief of state.
As president of the federal republic.
After federal Vice President Gregorio Salazar was killed during the occupation of Guatemala City by the rebel forces of Rafael Carrera, Vigil was selected to succeed him (1 February 1838). Morazán was then in his second term as president of the federation.
On 1 February 1839, Morazán turned the presidency over to Vigil. Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica had withdrawn from the federation in 1838, and soon Guatemala followed suit (17 April 1839). This left the "federation" with only one member, El Salvador. On 31 March 1840, El Salvador dissolved the federation and Vigil's term came to an end.
Later years.
On 8 April 1840 Diego Vigil and Francisco Morazán sailed from El Salvador for Costa Rica and Panama. After Morazán's execution on 15 September 1842 in San José, Costa Rica, Vigil settled in Granada, Nicaragua, where he remained until his death in 1845.

White Sulphur Springs (Amtrak station)

White Sulphur Springs Station is a railway station in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia served by Amtrak, the national passenger railway. The station is a stop on Amtrak's "Cardinal" route.
History.
White Sulphur Springs Station was built in 1930 (although some sources claim it was built in 1931) by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) to serve passengers on the new Pullman rail coaches to the resort hotel. The current brick building replaced a wooden structure that was built in the early 1900s. It is directly across from the entrance to The Greenbrier Hotel grounds. 
The original cottages that eventually expanded to a resort property known as the Old White Hotel, was purchased by C&O in 1910. The hotel was renovated and reopened in 1913 as the Greenbrier. The hotel became a showcase for the railroad company and it was promoted in C&O's timetables and literature. Tracks behind the station were used for parking business-owned and private cars of the wealthy patrons that came the hotel.
The station building now serves as resort hotel's own Christmas gift shop. The station's peppermint-striped paint job makes it unique among other Amtrak stations.

Magic Lantern (theater)

The Magic Lantern is a movie theater in Bridgton, Maine, United States. It was demolished due to a sinkhole located on-site. The theater reopened at its new location on February 8, 2008.
Original Magic Lantern.
The original theater, which had a Victorian-style lobby, opened in 1929 as the "New Meserve Theater" followed by "The Mayfair", "The Brookside" and finally in 1977 "The Magic Lantern" by entrepreneur Tom Goodman. Goodman secured the worldwide premier of author Stephen King's "The Shining" at the Magic Lantern. King pulled the strings to get the print for this benefit screening for the local hospital fundraiser. The Magic Lantern was also the first theater in Maine to install Dolby Stereo Surround sound.
The theater closed in the late 1980s and was run for a year by the town of Bridgton's recreation department. The following year the local Howell family purchased the building. The family business, Down East, Inc., had occupied the ground floor for many years while the theater occupied the 2nd floor. The family decided to reopen the single screen theater and to bring movies back to Bridgton.
In 1990, the theater was twinned to increase the number of movie choices. However, the condition of "The Brookside Building" as it was known by locals, had deteriorated due to poor soil conditions that existed on the site. Sloping floors, cracked foundations, freezing pipes and the physical sinking of the building sealed its fate.
On February 7, 2006 the theater was torn down. Down East, Inc. presented to the Town of Bridgton a plan to redevelop the entire site which included a new building for its operations on the site behind the old theater and a New Magic Lantern theater.
New Magic Lantern.
The new Magic Lantern officially began construction on March 1, 2007 and reopened on February 8, 2008. It features four screens (three with old fashioned balconies. The other screen is featured as a pub/café, and can be used to show live, televised events. The largest theater features a stage, and has been used for performances. Three of the screens are named after former Bridgton Theaters: The Meserve, The Mayfair, and The Brookside. The Brookside has nautical theming, the Meserve has 1920's theming, and the Mayfair has general Victorian theming. The pub, called the Tannery, is named after the Gibb's Tannery that used to be located on the site. It has a Medieval European theme, with dishes being named after the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Magic Lantern in former Czechoslovakia.
A theater bearing the name Magic Lantern is was also located in the former Czechoslovakia, and served as one of the principal meeting places during the Velvet Revolution in which the country overthrew their governing communist regime in favor of democracy. The Magic Lantern has been described as headquarters to the Czech part of the revolution.

<doc id="9902040" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9902040" title="Operation Achilles">
Operation Achilles

Operation Achilles was a NATO operation, part of the war in Afghanistan. Its objective was to clear Helmand province of the Taliban. The operation began on March 6, 2007. The offensive is the largest NATO-based operation in Afghanistan to date. NATO officials reported that, contrary to previous operations, Taliban fighters were avoiding direct confrontation in favor of guerilla tactics.
It was led by British ISAF forces and focused on the Kajakai Dam and the towns in the area, which is a major power source for Afghanistan that had not been functioning for a number of years. One part of the mission was Operation Volcano, where British Royal Marines successfully cleared a large Taliban complex near the Kajakai Dam, as well as Operation Kryptonite which actually saw the clearing of the dam by allied forces.
Background.
On March 16, U.S. General Dan McNeill reported that NATO forces were battling insurgents in various places in Southern Afghanistan but that most of the rebel fighters were steering clear of Western troops. He also said that NATO would launch new operations against the Taliban during the spring and summer.
Operation.
Operation Volcano, part of Operation Achilles, saw British Royal Marines clear a Taliban base, consisting of 25 compounds, near the Kajaki hydroelectric dam. The Royal Marines received heavy fire from Taliban assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The Royal Marines systematically cleared the compounds and buildings, backed up by mortars and air support.
On April 3, United States and Afghan forces raided a compound in the Helmand province, after getting a tip-off that a junior Taliban commander was hiding there. Indeed, Taliban forces were present. Heavy fighting broke out, which left at least 10 Taliban dead and two captured. The coalition had no casualties. The fate of the junior commander remains unknown.
On April 30, 1,000 ISAF troops, alongside Afghan National Army ground forces, pushed northwards through the Sangin Valley driving the Taliban from Gereshk and the surrounding villages. It was reported that coalition troops killed more than 130 Taliban fighters, but thousands of Afghans staged a protest saying the victims were civilians. Backed by air support, the Taliban fighters were killed in two separate battles in the western province of Herat, according to a US military statement. As part of the operation, British Royal Engineers built company sized patrol bases for the Afghan National Security Forces.
The deaths triggered an angry protest - the second in the country in two days - over what local villagers claimed was the killing of civilians. Herat, bordering Iran, had been relatively safe until recently compared with the south and east where the Taliban are most active. Both battles were in the Zerkoh valley, south of Shindand district, where Western troops have a large base, and running into Farah province further south.
A total of 87 Taliban fighters were killed during a 14-hour battle with US-led troops and Afghan forces on Sunday. Another 49 Taliban, including two of their leaders, were killed two days earlier after a group of Taliban fired at a joint coalition and Afghan patrol in another part of the valley. However, local officials said that up to 51 civilians, including women and children, were among the dead.
May timeline.
February 2007, Operation Volcano, a British operation to clear a Taliban base near the Kajaki hydroelectric dam.
May 1, southern Afghanistan NATO Commander Major-General Ton van Loon of the Netherlands was succeeded by Major-General Jacko Page of the United Kingdom.
May 13, 2007 Mullah Dadullah 2nd in command of the Taliban was killed in a clash with US, Afghan and NATO forces in Helmand Province. He was killed after coalition forces and Afghan forces found him leaving his hideout. Mullah Dadullah was the most experienced Commander the Taliban had at the time of his death.
May 18, Airstrikes targeted a convoy of suspected Taliban militants who had left a meeting in western Afghanistan, killing 14 and wounding 10, a provincial governor reported.
May 21, Taliban militants ambushed a joint U.S.coalition and Afghan patrol in a southern town near Helmand, sparking a battle and airstrikes that killed 25 suspected insurgents, U.S.officials said.
May 30, Operation Achilles ended and the new Operation Lastay Kulang began.

<doc id="9902098" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9902098" title="Yankee Cannonball">
Yankee Cannonball

The Yankee Cannonball is a wooden out-and-back roller coaster built in 1930 at Lakewood Park and relocated in 1936 to Canobie Lake Park, Salem, New Hampshire.
History.
The roller coaster was designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Its serial number is 86. In 1930, it was installed under the name "Roller Coaster" at Lakewood Park in Waterbury, Connecticut. Frank F. Hoover oversaw the construction. The coaster operated in Connecticut for only five years before being closed and moved to Canobie Lake Park. It was rechristened the "Yankee Cannonball" in 1985, in commemoration of the American Civil War. The coaster's train colors were originally blue and gray, representing the Union and Confederacy sides of the conflict, all being united on the ride's red, white, and blue superstructure.
When the ride was moved to Canobie in 1936, each section was shortened by six inches to help it fit the area planned for it. The rethemed ride opened for the 1936 season and has operated continuously since, though the lift hill was destroyed by Hurricane Carol in 1954, and it was closed for repair during the following season.
The coaster's coloring has been altered since 1936 with retracking work done on the coaster. Some of this retracking was completed by Martin & Vleminckx. As of the 2009 season, the ride superstructure is white with orange handrails. One train is colored red, white and blue, while the other is hunter green and orange. The coaster is one of the first rides seen when entering the park's parking lot.
Layout.
The ride's layout is an out and back pattern with a 90° turn in the middle, creating the basic L-shape common in early wooden coasters. The primary elements include small hills designed to give moments of airtime and strongly banked turns. Restraints on the trains used to consist of a single lap bar with no seat belts allowing single riders to slide across the seat, making full use of the banked turns. Seat belts and center seat dividers were later added. Once the site of an infield, the area inside the L-shape is now employee parking for the park.
Upon dispatch, the train takes a slight downward grade through a right turn into the 65' lift hill. The ride's initial drop is the largest at 63' 6". This is followed by a short airtime rise, then the second hill which has the 90° right turn at the top. Two small airtime rises precede the steeply banked 180° turnaround. The returning course takes the coaster parallel to the first half of the ride, traveling through a series of bunny hills, the brake run and a short turn into the station. The total duration of the ride is about one minute with a top speed of 35 mph.
Rolling stock.
The Yankee Cannonball has two trains, but only one runs at a time. There are 6 riders per car, for a total of 18 riders per train. The trains were built by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Restraints consist of headrests and lap bars, and seat belts were added for the 2003 season, as a response to a 2001 accident, in which the two trains collided at the foot of the lift hill due to operator failure in engaging the brakes.

Knob Creek Gun Range

Knob Creek Gun Range (also referred to as Knob Creek Range or simply Knob Creek) is an outdoor shooting range located in Bullitt County, Kentucky, United States, near the community of West Point, Kentucky. The range is a former military-munitions test range. As well as being open all year around, the gun range also hosts a biannual gun show in April and October, which is billed as the "World's Largest Machine Gun Shoot and Military Gun Show". The range also hosts a number of shotgun, handgun, rifle and machine gun competitions in April. The range is a family-owned business, with three generations of the founding Sumner family working there as of April 2013. Both the range and the Sumner family are featured on "Guntucky", a reality TV series that debuted on the CMT cable channel on April 21, 2013.
Machine gun shoot.
Held in April and October, "The World's Largest Machine Gun Shoot and Military Gun Show" is an event that draws machine gun dealers, collectors and enthusiasts from all over the country. The Machine Gun Shoot itself consists of several rounds of firing at a wide variety of appliances, vehicles and pyramids of tires. Participants also have the opportunity to shoot at barrels of fuel with pyrotechnic charges attached, which explode when struck by bullets. The objective for these shooters is to destroy everything down range. The presence of many rare and powerful fully automatic weapons also draws many visitors, with firearms ranging from submachine guns to .50 BMG heavy machine guns and M134 Miniguns.
The main event of the Machine Gun Shoot is the "Night shoot" where, after dark, gasoline-filled metal drums and explosives are set up in and around the targets, and tracer ammunition is used.
Although reserving a lane for the machine gun shoot is difficult with a several-years-long waiting list, lane holders usually rent the use of their weapons to spectators for a nominal fee to cover the cost of ammunition and wear and tear on the guns themselves.
Firearms dealing.
The Military Gun Show is also a place for dealers to buy, sell and trade Class III firearms. Quote their website:
The Military Gun Show has drawn dealers from all over the country to buy, sell, and trade Class III Firearms. The show is set up in a large lighted pole barn adjacent to the firing line and Clubhouse. Security is on patrol at all times.

Royal Romanian Air Force

The Forţele Aeriene Regale ale României (Royal Romanian Air Force, FARR), or simply Forţele Aeriene Române (Romanian Air Force) was the Air Arm of Royal Romanian forces in World War II. It provided support to land forces, carrying out reconnaissance and mounting air raids between other missions.
Insignia.
The insignia of the FARR was a yellow cross (Michael the Brave cross) in the fuselage and upper and lower wings, and the national colours on the tail, with a yellow engine cowling and vertical band on the fuselage. It was later changed at tricolor (red-yellow-blue) roundels on the fuselage and wings, and a tricolor band on the tail.
History.
FARR flew aircraft from Germany and Italy, with their own and other foreign aircraft, as well as captured enemy aircraft. The Romanian Air Force fought against the Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierö (Hungarian Air Force) during the Hungarian annexation of Transylvania. The most basic unit of their formations was the squadron ("Grup"). The Romanian Air Force fought alongside the Luftwaffe during the advance into the Ukraine and Crimea, until the Battle of Stalingrad, when the Southern Luftwaffe Command was installed in Bucharest. It also carried out some reconnaissance and patrol missions over the Black Sea alongside Bulgarian units. The Romanian Air Force was tasked with the air defence of the Ploieşti oil installations, and also Bucharest against Allied air raids, and to protect Axis convoys in the Black Sea. These units fought against the USAAF and RAF during their raids against Romania.
The main models of aircraft used include the PZL P.24F, Hawker Hurricane, Heinkel He 112, Messerschmitt 109E and G types, Messerschmitt 110 (for night defence), IAR 80A were used too, alongside other types of interceptors used by the Luftwaffe units in area.
When the country was invaded by Soviet forces, King Mihai I (Michael) ordered Romanian forces to attack Axis forces, and the FARR was allied with Soviet Voenno-vozdushniye Sily against German and Hungarian forces in Transylvania and Slovakia, though some units continued to fight with the Axis in Luftwaffe volunteer units.
Aircraft companies.
Aircraft constructed under foreign license
Enemy aircraft interned or captured.
As a result to the Soviet Invasion of Poland, a large number of Polish Air Force aircraft were interned in Romania. Also, some Soviet were captured during WWII, as well as few American B-24 Liberator bombers.

Revolt On Antares

Revolt On Antares is a science fiction themed microgame designed by Tom Moldvay and produced by TSR, Inc. in 1981. Similar to the microgames produced by Steve Jackson Games, it was sold in a transparent plastic shell case and came with rulebook, full-color hex-map, counters, and one six-sided die. Other games in this series (called "minigames" by TSR) include "They've Invaded Pleasantville!", "Remember the Alamo", "Attack Force", "Vampyre", "Viking Gods", "Icebergs" and "Saga".
The action of the game takes place on Imhirrhos, the ninth planet in the Antares system. Two to four players assume the roles of leaders of different factions fighting for control of the planet as the influence of Earth's Imperial Terran Empire begins to weaken. The factions include seven different ruling families or houses, Terran Empire forces, natives, and alien Silakkans. Players can choose from one of three different game scenarios.
House Leaders.
Each of the seven houses has a leader with varying numbers of forces to command such as Hovercrafts, Jump Troops, Laser Tanks, and Power Infantry as well as one Artifact (see below). Each leader also possesses a special ability.
Galactic Heroes.
If a house leader is killed during combat, the player has the opportunity to recruit a Galactic Hero to replace him. Like house leaders, Galactic Heroes also have special powers or lead additional forces.
Other Factions.
In addition to the seven house leaders there are three other power groups that may or may not come into play depending on the game scenario.
Artifacts.
Each house has possession of a special alien artifact, chosen at random at the beginning of the game.
Scenarios and Gameplay.
Revolt on Antares has three different game scenarios: Revolt Against Terra (the basic game), The Silakka Invasion, and Power Politics on Imirrhos.

Exploring Reality

Exploring Reality: The Intertwining of Science & Religion is a book by John Polkinghorne which offers a "progress report" on his "search for truth. All my life I have been trying to explore reality. That exploration includes science, but it also necessarily takes me beyond it. The process of investigation has a spiral character, as tackling the issues draws the explorer inwards towards a deeper engagement with the multidimensional character of reality"
Publication Information.
The book is published by SPCK in the UK and by Yale University Press in the USA, in 2005. ISBN 0-300-11014-6
Synopsis.
In 1. Reality Polkinghorne explains "how natural the task of exploring reality is for someone whose intellectual formation has been in the sciences"(p xi) and asserts his belief in Critical realism against Postmodernism.
2. The Causal Nexus of the World suggests that "scientifically our knowledge is still pretty patchy, excellent within certain well-defined domains but often unable to make satisfactory connections between different domains. The problematic of the relationship of Quantum physics to Classical physics provides an instructive example" and also that "matters of causality ... are not finally settled by science alone. Ultimate conclusions have to rest on the foundation of a metaphysical decision."(p xii)
In 3. Human Nature he notes that Charles Kingsley and Frederick Temple welcomed Charles Darwin's insights, which also implied a level of continuity between humans and other animals. However he notes that humans abilities in language, science and rationality are very different from those of animals. He says "the fact that we share 98.4% of our DNA with chimpanzees shows the fallacy of genetic reductionism, rather than proving that we are only apes who are slightly different. After all I share 99.9% of my DNA with J. S. Bach, but that fact carries no implication of a close correspondence between our musical abilities"(p45). He suggests that "while natural selection has been an important factor in the development of life on Earth, it is by no means obvious that it is the only type of process involved" and that "the attempt to force classical Darwinian thinking into the role of an explanatory principle of almost universal scope has proved singularly unconvincing as it seeks to inflate an assembly of half-truths into a theory of everything". He believes that Evolutionary epistemology is also based on a half-truth. Being able to make sense of everyday experience is a vital asset, yet when Newton discovered universal gravity, something happened that went far beyond anything needed for survival and that rational feats like proving Fermat's Last Theorem go far beyond anything susceptible to Darwinian explanation.

Arga (river)

The Arga is a river of Navarre, in Spain and is one of the tributaries of the river Ebro. The Arga was known as the river Runa in antiquity. Situated in the north-east of Spain, the river stretches some 145 kilometres, and has a basin of 2,759 km², 2,652 km² of which is in Navarre and the remaining 107 km² is near Arakil. The source of the river is to the north of the village Esteríbar, near the border with France, and it empties into the Aragón River near Funes.
The river is dammed in the Eugui reservoir near Esteríbar; the dam principally serves the needs of Pamplona's metropolitan area, the largest city on the Arga.
Vegetation.
At the upper basin, the river is mainly surrounded by beech trees and beneath these grow bilberries, cornish heath, sedges and luzulas. Additionally, a variety of shrubs can be found in the proximity of the Eugui reservoir, including; alder, ash, maple, common hazel and buckthorn. After the dam, the lower river is lined with oak and Scots Pine trees and boxwood shrubs.
At the point where the river passes Huarte/Uharte, crack willow appear. The shrubbery around the area of Belascoáin marks the change from Cantabrian forest to more Mediterranean plant life; black poplar and white willow are common in this region.

<doc id="9902256" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9902256" title="Reform mathematics">
Reform mathematics

Reform mathematics is an approach to mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards with the publication of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to serve as the basis for many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.
Mathematics instruction in this style has been called "standards-based mathematics" or "reform mathematics". 
Principles and standards.
The momentum for reform in mathematics education began in the early 1980s, as educators reacted to the "new math" of the 1960s and 1970s. The work of Piaget and other developmental psychologists was shifting the focus of mathematics educators from mathematics content to how children best learn mathematics. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics summarized the state of current research with the publication of Curriculum and Evaluation Standards in 1989 and Principles and Standards for School Mathematics in 2000, bringing definition to the reform movement in North America.
Reform mathematics curricula challenge students to make sense of new mathematical ideas through explorations and projects, often in real contexts. Reform texts emphasize written and verbal communication, working in cooperative groups, making connections between concepts, and connections between representations. By contrast, "traditional" textbooks emphasize procedural mathematics and provide step-by-step examples with skill exercises.
Traditional mathematics focuses on teaching algorithms that will lead to the correct answer. Because of this focus on application of algorithms, the traditional math student must always use the specific method that is being taught. This kind of algorithmic dependence is de-emphasized in reform mathematics. Reformers do not oppose correct answers, but prefer to focus students' attention on the process leading to the answer, rather than the answer itself. The presence of occasional errors is deemed less important than the overall thought process. Research has shown that children make fewer mistakes with calculations and remember algorithms longer when they understand the concepts underlying the methods they use. In general, children in reform classes perform at least as well as children in traditional classes on tests of calculation skill, and considerably better on tests of problem solving.
Controversy.
While "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics" has been championed by educators, administrators and some mathematicians as raising standards for all students, it has been criticized for valuing understanding processes more than learning standard procedures. Parents opposing reform mathematics have complained about decreased focus on basic computation skills and confusion caused by the increased emphasis on exploration and explanation. Proponents of reform mathematics have countered that research has shown that, when done correctly, students in reform math curricula learn basic math skills at least as well as those in traditional programs, and additionally understand the underlying concepts much better. Communities that have adopted reform curricula have generally seen increased math scores by their students. 
The development and large-scale adoption of curricula such as Mathland have been criticized for partially or entirely abandoning teaching of standard arithmetic methods such as regrouping or common denominators. Protests from groups such as Mathematically Correct have led to many districts and states abandoning such textbooks. Some states such as California have revised their mathematics standards to partially or largely repudiate the basic beliefs of reform mathematics, and re-emphasize mastery of standard mathematics facts and methods.
The American Institutes for Research (AIR) reported in 2005 that the NCTM proposals "risk exposing students to unrealistically advanced mathematics content in the early grades." This is in reference to NCTM's recommendation that algebraic concepts, such as understanding patterns and properties like commutativity (2+3=3+2), should be taught as early as first grade.
Some, such as the 2008 National Mathematics Advisory Panel, have called for a balance between reform and traditional mathematics teaching styles rather than a "war" between the two styles. In 2006 NCTM published its Curriculum Focal Points, which made clear that standard algorithms were to be included in all elementary school curricula, as well as activities aiming at conceptual understanding. 
A common misconception is that reform educators do not want children to learn the standard methods of arithmetic. As the NCTM Focal Points make clear, such methods are still the ultimate goal, but reformers believe that conceptual understanding should come first. Reform educators believe that such understanding is best pursued by allowing children at first to solve problems using their own understanding and methods. Under guidance from the teacher, students eventually arrive at an understanding of standard methods. Even the controversial NCTM Standards of 1989 did not call for abandoning standard algorithms, but instead recommended a decreased emphasis on complex paper-and-pencil computation drills and greater attention to mental computation, estimation skills, thinking strategies for mastering basic facts and conceptual understanding of arithmetic operations.
During the peak of the controversy, unfavorable terminology for reform mathematics appeared in press and web articles, including "Where's the math?", "anti-math", "math for dummies", "no-math mathematics", "rainforest algebra", "math for women and minorities", and "new new math". Most of these critical terms refer to the 1989 standards rather than the PSSM.

Disco (TV series)

Disco was a pop music program that aired in Germany on the ZDF network from 1971 to 1982. It generally aired on the first Saturday of each month at 7:30PM, each show running 45 minutes. 133 shows were produced. The show was hosted by German actor and comedian Ilja Richter. Its lesser known predecessor on ZDF, "4-3-2-1 Hot & Sweet" was aired between 1966 and 1970, presenters included Ilja Richter and Suzanne Doucet. "Disco" generally served a younger pop-oriented audience compared to ZDF's "Hitparade", and until 1972, its main competitor was "Beat-Club" (originally patterned after the pure live-act show "Ready Steady Go!" in the UK, from the late-1960s turning more and more into psychedelic music videos made especially for the invited acts), followed by "Musikladen", both on ARD.
Repeats of "Disco" have been aired since 1984 on ZDF Musikkanal, after its closedown in 1989 on 3sat. Since 2004, the digital ZDF Theaterkanal (which is now zdf.kultur) aired repeats of the entire series until 2012. In 2007, ZDF Dokukanal began to air reruns, starting with episodes from 1975 and also multiple repeats of the series have been shown on hit24
in 2008, most recently zdf.kultur began to show the entire series each day in 2013.
The show focussed on chart hits current at the time of airing, giving about equal airtime to international pop music and German Schlager. Despite its name, it did not particularly focus on disco music although it featured many disco hits as long as they were chart relevant. (The name of the show was devised before disco as a musical style existed).

Justin Walker (Brothers &amp; Sisters)

Justin Walker is a fictional character on the American primetime drama series "Brothers & Sisters". He is played by actor Dave Annable. In a 2010 episode, actor Dylan Larsen portrayed Justin as a young child in flashback sequences set in 1986.
Character history.
Background.
Justin is the youngest child of Nora and William Walker, and often feels over-protected by his parents and siblings. When Justin was in his early teens, a family friend named Tucker Booth introduced him to drugs. After September 11, when Kitty returned from New York to stay with her family, she confides to Justin her experiences and fears stemming from that catastrophic event. It was for these reasons that he was compelled to join the Army. When he returned from Afghanistan, he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, leading to his drug addiction. Nora blamed Kitty for encouraging Justin to join the army, leading to their estrangement.
The Black Sheep.
Justin spent much of his time getting high up north with his buddies and spending little time doing anything else in his youth. The closest thing in his life to a relationship was with a fellow aimless drug addict named Fawn. William, his father, wanted to get him a job at Ojai Foods (the family business) and during this time Justin saw his father talking to a mysterious woman - Holly Harper - at the company. After his father's death, Justin saw her again making a brief appearance at the funeral. He tracked her down and asked her how she knew his father; Holly told him they'd been lovers for years. To make matters worse, his father's will stipulated that any money for Justin would go into an allowance, with Kitty in charge of the allowance. Justin was humiliated, didn't show up for his job at a restaurant, and wasn't heard from until the next day when Nora got a call that he'd been picked up by the police. Nora, Kevin, and Kitty got him out of jail, but he bristled at Nora telling him how disappointed William would be in him.
Despite his problems, Justin has redeeming characteristics. But he had his own serious issues. He continued taking prescription painkillers, like Oxycodone and Vicodin, for his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, nearly costing him another job (as a bell boy). His boss was a young woman named Tyler, whom he knew casually in high school. They began dating.
Also, when Justin's brother Tommy found out he was sterile and asked Kevin to be a sperm donor, for his wife Julia, Kevin initially refused, so Justin said he'd be a donor. Tommy said he didn't want Justin to be a donor, since he wasn't reliable and used drugs. Justin was hurt but eventually Tommy changed his mind. Both Kevin and Justin were donors, and agreed they would never find out who the father was.
Iraq & Drug Use.
At this point, things were looking up for Justin. Unfortunately, he got orders to go to Iraq. He was so devastated by the news that he relapsed, badly, and overdosed. He also ruined his relationship with Tyler, as she had seen him with Fawn on a drug high and told him she didn't want to deal with his behavior (she didn't know about his learning he had to go to Iraq). With Kevin's help, Justin was given a reprieve for six months, as long as he went to rehab.
His former boss and girlfriend, Tyler, returned after Justin cleaned up his drug habit. He ran into her when she was with her new boyfriend for a Valentine's Day dinner. He apologized to her for his past behavior, and she decided to give their relationship another go. They were happy together briefly, but soon he decided that until he dealt with "all" his problems, he shouldn't put another person through what he was dealing with.
Eventually, the time came for Justin to return to active duty. Justin wanted to ship out to Iraq without letting his family know, so he slipped away from his sister, Kitty's, engagement party informing only Rebecca. Rebecca told Kitty and Nora and they rushed to the airport for a tearful goodbye.
Several months later, Justin returned from Iraq with a leg injury. He suffered from tremendous pain, but refused to take meds because of his history as an addict. Eventually, after strong pressure, Nora convinced him to start taking pain medication, to which he became addicted once more.
Rebecca.
Justin found out that he had a half-sister, Rebecca Harper, the product of William and Holly. Most of the Walkers were hesitant about how to deal with this new relation, but Justin went to visit her as soon as he learned of her existence. He helped her steer clear of drugs and ardently defended her when she said Sarah's husband made a pass at her.
Justin later had an inkling that Rebecca may not, in fact, be his sister. She took a paternity test and told him that she was his sister, to his relief. This relief was short-lived however, as he began to develop what could only be called "inappropriate" feelings for her - of a romantic nature. He told his brother Kevin about it and Kevin told him to stay away from her, which he did. But eventually, he told her his feelings and she "freaked out". The day after, he apologized to her. She then revealed to him that she was not actually his half-sister, but the daughter of David Caplan.

Gothic belly dance

Gothic belly dance, also known as Gothic fusion belly dance, dark fusion belly dance and Gothic tribal fusion, is a recently founded dance art movement, distilled from the influences of Middle Eastern dance, tribal fusion, Goth subculture, and Neopaganism. Originating from The Arizona Center night clubs in 1992, it is practiced by amateur and professional dancers of the United States and Europe, and it is growing elsewhere with the spread of other tribal belly dance formats. [http://www.gothla.co.uk]
History.
Originating in the Middle East, South Asia (India), and North Africa, the art of belly dance arrived in the West with the trend of Orientalism. Exotic to the Western eye and mysterious in its roots, belly dance has always attracted interpretive dance artists who have woven it into trends of Western culture. The new millennium brought a revival of popular interest in Goth subculture and Gothic art motifs in dance, and a new interpretive style, Gothic belly dance, was propelled to prominence. 
Dance publications started exploring this new phenomenon, thousands of Gothic belly dance enthusiasts have subscribed to online discussion groups dedicated to this genre, leading artists started traveling across the US and overseas with workshops and tours, DVDs featuring Gothic belly dance performances, and instructional materials have appeared on retail shelves. 
Gothic belly dance was born in the early 1990s all over the world, US urban centers as a blend of Goth and world music, the movement vocabulary of belly dance and other dance forms, and Gothic fashion and aesthetics. Performing at Gothic-themed events and Goth clubs, dancers started to explore Goth music and adopt costuming styles incorporating Victorian, vampire, dark cabaret, silent-movie vamp, industrial, and other visual themes related to Goth subculture.
Although the concept of 'Gothic belly dance' may have originated in the US it is not just a US phenomenon. The UK and Germany has had Gothic belly dancers for many years as in Goths who are also belly dance teachers and performers and have been "dancing darkly" at "haflas" (hafla: Arabic for "party") and other events for a long time. These dancers did not have as much of an outlet for their styles as they do now and perhaps not even a label for what they did. Partly thanks to links through the web and the Gothla festival, Gothic belly dance is recognised in many countries.
The 21st century.
As a modern and versatile world dance genre, belly dance has evolved into an array of interpretive dance sub-styles compatible with modern music and imagery. Dancers performing Gothic belly dance usually retain their preferred technique — mostly modern cabaret and tribal fusion belly dance — but also bring new emphasis to the dramatic and theatrical features of their dance to match the intensity and vibe of Goth music.
Gothic belly dance discussion groups hosted by tribe.net, MySpace, and other online community sites connected dancers from around the world, making possible workshops and tours, and helping this new genre to solidify and gain recognition within the larger dance community. In addition, the rapidly expanding global access to free online video resources at YouTube and similar sites has allowed artists to unify and combine their efforts in promoting and developing their genre — unconstrained by national borders, scarcity of funds, or lack of support from their local communities.
In 2007 Southern California-based dancers and instructors, Tempest and Sashi, launched the annual Gothla, described by the "L.A. Weekly" as "a "Gothic hafla" that combines weekend-long workshops with a Saturday festival featuring 12 hours of performances and merchant booths where dancers can find costumes and accessories." Gothla US 2009 took place March 6–8 at Cal Poly Pomona.
Gothla UK was also first held in 2007, in Leicester, England, and is now a highly successful festival covering three days, usually in July. International teachers are joined by UK teachers such as Lucretia (Christine Emery), Fulya (Lynn Chapman), and Akasha (Heike Humphreys) to offer a range of themes not often covered by general belly dance events from Steampunk and 1920s to zombie and vampire belly dance.

Broughty Athletic F.C.

Broughty Athletic F.C. is a Scottish football club based in Broughty Ferry, a suburb of the city of Dundee. Members of the Scottish Junior Football Association, they currently play in the East Region Premier League.
History.
Formed in 1920 as Broughty Ex-Servicemen, the club was retitled Broughty Athletic in 1951. Around the same time they moved to Claypotts Park, directly opposite the medieval Claypotts Castle. In 1989 the ground was renamed Whitton Park, in memory of player and club official Eddie Whitton, who had died on 5 June 1989. The SJFA restructured its leagues prior to the 2006-07 season, and "The Fed", as the club is known, found themselves in the twelve-team East Region, North Division.
In seasons 2007–08 and 2008–09, Broughty Athletic narrowly missed out on promotion, finishing second top of the Scottish Junior Football Association's North Division in both seasons. In 2009–10 promotion to the twelve-team Premier League was finally achieved. The Fed maintained Premier Divisionstatus by finishing eighth at the end of the 2010–11 season. They extended their stay in the Premier League when they finished in ninth place at the end of the 2011–12 season. The fed finished bottom in the 2012–13 season, but stayed up due to a league reconstruction.
The fed finished seventh in 2013–14 season , and have hopes to get promoted within the next two years to the East Region Super League.
Dundee East Community Sport Club Project.
Dundee East Community Sports Club is currently the most developed model of a Community Sports Club which Broughty Athletic are part of. The Hub is made up of 5 local football clubs, a Rugby Club, Cricket Club, Tennis and Table Tennis Club, Bowling Club, a local Handball Club and also a Karate Club providing a pathway from ages 5 up to Adult's including Amateur and Junior level football clubs, The Hub itself is based in the East side of Dundee and is situated around Whitton Park, Forthill Sports Club, Douglas Sports Centre, Claypotts and Dawson grass pitches. DECSC are also developing strong links with the local primary and secondary schools.
The Hub currently has 12 clubs involved within its structure and has over 1200 members and 150 qualified coaches and volunteers. The Community Club already has a development plan in place and is working hard to implement the plan within the 5 year set timescale. Their development plans are centred on the current development of Whitton Park facility to include a 7 a side 3G floodlit training pitch and also an 11 a side floodlit playing pitch which will be fully utilised by the local community. The 7 a side pitch has been built and has been in use since July 2012. There will also be significant developments in changing facilities with a new state of the art stand to be built on the West side of the Whitton park which will include 6 changing rooms, fitness suite and also meeting and socialising facilities.
The Dundee East Community Sports Club has benefited from having a very strong committee in place. They have been successful in attracting committee members from all of the resulting clubs within the community club structure. They are a very ambitious committee and they are all working hard to ensure all the proposed developments come to life. The Club has already established a branding and marketing profile which all teams affiliated are displaying on their team colours and the club have also already delivered fun day events and football festivals on a city wide basis. They hope that the new Whitton Park facilities will be built and be running before 2016

Campaign at the Eastern Foothills of Funiu Mountain

Campaign at the Eastern Foothills of Funiu Mountain (伏牛山东麓战役) was a series of battles fought between the nationalists and the communists during the Chinese Civil War after World War II for the control of western Hubei, and the border areas of Hubei, Henan and Shaanxi provinces. The campaign resulted in the communist victory.
Prelude.
In mid October 1947, the nationalists had gathered forces included the V Corps centered at Luoyang at the east, and the Reorganized 1st Division and the Reorganized 36th Division at Tongguan County at the west for the preparation to reopen the Longhai railway transportation / communication line by first surrounding and then annihilating the communist force led by commander Chen Geng (陈赓) and political commissar Xie Fuzhi. On October 20, 1947, the communist high command ordered Chen Geng (陈赓) and Xie Fuzhi to split their force into three: one part would remain along the railroad to distract the enemy, and the other would strike southern Shaanxi. The third part, the main force, should cross the railroad to push southward, and would strike regions included Nanzhao (南召), Wuyang (舞阳), and Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) in western Hubei to establish new bases. To carry out this strategy, Chen Geng (陈赓) and Xie Fuzhi decided to launch the Campaign at the Eastern Foothills of Funiu Mountain.
Order of battle.
Both sides were equally matched in terms of numbers, but the nationalists enjoyed significant technical advantage in terms of weaponry.
First stage.
The campaign started on October 29, 1947 with the communist 55th Division of the 38th Army deployed along the Longhai Railroad to tie down the nationalist forces, and the rest units of the communist 38th Army and the 12th Brigade of the communist 4th Column struck toward southern Shaanxi. The rest units of the communist 4th Column and the communist 9th Column struck the nationalist controlled regions in multiple fronts. From November 1, 1947 thru November 4, 1947, Linru (临汝), Jia (郏) County, Dengfeng (登封), Lushan (鲁山), and Baofeng (宝丰) fell into the communist hands. The nationalist Reorganized 15th Division guarding these regions suffered greatly in the process, with more than 2,500 killed in the battle of Jia (郏) County alone on November 4, 1947. The nationalists were forced to redeploy by dispatching the Reorganized 3rd Division and the 20th Division toward Baofeng (宝丰) and Jia (郏) County, the 124th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 41st Division toward Linru (临汝), and the 125th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 41st Division toward Xiang City (Xiang Cheng, 襄城) in hope of luring the communists out to fight a decisive battle. However, the enemy would not take the bait and instead, took advantage of the nationalist redeployment by striking regions where nationalist defense was weakened by the redeployment.
On November 3, 1947, the communist 27th Brigade of the 9th Column besieged the town of Nanzhao (南召), and launched the assault on the town at 1:00 AM on November 4, 1947. The strongest fortification at the Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, 东关) was blown up and attacking enemy subsequently penetrated into the town and annihilated most of the nationalist garrison consisted of two battalions. As the survivors attempted to flee via the western gate, they were ambushed by the waiting enemy and the entire 500 strong nationalist garrison was thus completely wiped out. After taking the town, the communists opened up the nationalist food depot and treasury to distribute food and money to the local populace, most of which was in severe poverty, and thus completely won over the local popular support. On November 5, 1947, the 75th Regiment of the 25th Brigade of the communist 9th Column reached the outskirt of the Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城). Although the nationalists had built many fortifications both inside and outside the town, the local nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (王敬修) was well aware that his four-regiments strong security brigade was not a match for the enemy, and in order to avoid annihilation, the nationalist garrison wisely abandoned the town without a fight, thus successfully retreated before the enemy besieged the town. After entering the town, the communist force with strict discipline discredited the negative nationalist propaganda about the communists and consequently, the local popular support drastically switched to the communist side.
The initial communist success was totally unexpected by the nationalists, who was completely shocked by the rapid territorial expansion of the enemy. Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered the commander-in-chief of the 5th Corps Li Tiejun (李铁军) to personally lead the nationalist Reorganized 3rd Division and the 20th Division totaling seven brigades to pursuit the communists for the subsequent elimination. The communists held a conference in the town of Nanzhao (南召) on November 8, 1947 and decided not to engage the technically superior nationalist adversary. Instead, the nationalists would be lured into the Funiu Mountains and tricked into dispersing themselves into smaller fragments first, and then when the situation allowed, the communists would annihilate these small fragments one by one. While some communist units would fake as the main force to lure the nationalists into the mountains, the actual main force would take advantage of the overstretched nationalist defense by establishing new communist bases in the remote and rural regions.
Second stage.
The communist 13th Brigade of the 4th Column and the 25th Brigade of the 9th Column under the political commissar Huang Zhen (黄镇) and the deputy commander-in-chief Huang Xiyou (黄新友, unrelated to the political commissar Huang Zhen 黄镇) of the communist 9th Column had successfully tricked the nationalists in believing that they were the main communist force by faking as a much larger force on their attack toward Zhenping (镇平), Internal Township (Nei Xiang, 内乡) and Western Gorge Entrance (Xi Xia Kou, 西峡口) regions. The nationalists were tricked to deploy the 3rd Reorganized Division and the 125th Brigade of the 41st Division to pursuit the fake enemy main force, and after wasting more than half a month at Summer Hotel (Xia Guang, 夏馆) and (Xi Xia Kou, 西峡口) regions, the nationalist force not only failed to annihilate the enemy, but was also incapable of stopping the enemy from cutting the communication / transportation line between (Xi Xia Kou, 西峡口) and Jingzi Pass (Jing Zi Guang, 荆紫关). The enemy had planned to lure the nationalists into the Funiu Mountains and then annihilate them in ambushes when the opportunity presented itself, but due to the lack of supplies, the nationalists was forced to withdraw and thus escaped unscratched. The enemy did, however, successfully establish two new bases in the regions: the sixth military district by the communist 39th Regiment of the 13th Brigade in the region of Li Qing’s Hotel (Li Qing Dian, 李青店) of Nanzhao (南召) county, under the command of the deputy commander of the communist 13th Brigade, Li Xifu (黎锡福), and the seventh military district by the communist 33rd Regiment of the 11th Brigade under the command of the political commissar of the 11th Brigade, Hu Rungui (胡荣贵). Meanwhile, the main force of the communist 9th Column and the 22nd Brigade of the communist 4th Column threatened Luoyang by penetrating into the vicinity of the city, forcing the nationalist 206th Division to be redeployed to strengthen the defensive of the city. The 10th Brigade and the 11th Brigade of the communist 4th Column penetrated into regions of Wuyang (舞阳), Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城), and Miyang (泌阳), forcing the nationalist Reorganized 10th Division and the 124th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 41st Division to be redeployed to east of Beijing-Hankou railroad.
In order to take the initiative by luring the nationalists to overstretch themselves, the newly taken towns of Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) and Nanzhao (南召) were intentionally abandoned by the communists, and the nationalists subsequently fell for the trick by ordering Song Kezun (宋可尊), the nationalist chief-of-staff of the sixth regional security command of Henan to reenter the Nanzhao (南召) as the new mayor of the town and the commander the local garrison. The former nationalist garrison of the Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城), meanwhile, was ordered back to the town under Wang Jingxiu (王敬修), the commander. On November 11, 1947, the communist 10th Brigade of the 4th Column in the eastern foothills of the Funiu Mountain launched a surprise attack on Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城), and the nationalist defenders abandoned the town and fled, and the town fell into the enemy hands for the second time. On November 13, 1947, the fleeing nationalists were caught up by the 31st Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the communist 4th Column at Erlang Temple, and were thus badly mauled by the pursuing enemy. The nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (王敬修) learned that the nationalist 20th Division was moving toward Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城), so he ordered his surviving troops to move toward the town in an attempt to link up with his nationalist comrades-in-arms. Little did the nationalists know that their enemy was waiting to ambush them.
On November 21, 1947, the communist 10th Brigade of the 4th Column suddenly struck the town of Nanzhao (南召), and the nationalist garrison consisted on a security regiment and two companies was overwhelmed. After losing three companies, including more than 50 killed and over 270 captured alive by the attacking enemy, the surviving nationalists were forced to abandon the town and flee, and thus town of Nanzhao (南召) had fallen into the enemy hands for the second time, and this time for good. On November 22, 1947, as the nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (王敬修)’s surviving Self Defense of the Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) reached Eight Mile Intersection (Ba Li Cha, 八里岔), King Yu’s Village (Wang Yu Zhuang, 王禹庄), and Eastern Qi Village (Dong Qi Zhuang, 东齐庄) regions south of Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城), it was ambushed by the communist 31st Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the 4th Column. Only 100 or so under the command of the commander of the nationalist force Bai Guixuan (白桂煊) was lucky enough to escape, while all of the rest were annihilated by the waiting enemy. The nationalists suffered 740 fatalities and another 400+ were captured alive by the enemy, including the deputy commander Ma Lianfu (马廉府), who was able to successfully escape later during a forced march. After his escape, Ma Lianfu (马廉府) immediately went to Kaifeng to ask the nationalist provincial chairman Liu Maoen (刘茂恩) for help, but instead, he was executed on the spot for his failure as Liu Maoen (刘茂恩) ordered him to be shot in front of other nationalist commanders. On the other front, the communist 38th Army established a new base in the regions of Merchant County (Shang Xian, 商县), Luonan (洛南) and Merchant Southern (Shang Nan, 商南), while the communist 12th Brigade established another new base in the regions of Mountain Sun (Shan Yang, 山阳), Yun Xi (郧西), Zhen’an (Zhen An, 镇安), Upper Pass (Shang Guan, 上关).
On November 23, 1947, the nationalist 133rd Brigade of the 20th Division under the Divisional commander Yang Gancai (杨干才) begun its push toward Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) from Independent tree (Du Shu, 独树) Town, but the progress was slow due to the stubborn resistance from the 10th Brigade and the 11th Brigade of the communist 4th Column at Yueyang Village (Yue Yang Zhuang, 岳杨庄), Zan Village (Zan Zhuang, 昝庄), and Northern New Street (Bei Xin Jie, 北新街) regions. On November 24, 1947, the nationalist 134th Brigade of the 20th Division also begun its push toward Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) from Nanyang, Henan, and after some setback at Pengyao (盆窑) regions due to enemy resistance, managed to link up with the nationalist133rd Brigade of the 20th Division in the region to east of Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城). The enemy gave up the town without a fight in attempt to lure the nationalists into the mountain for an ambush but the nationalists refused to be baited and would not venture out of the protection of the city wall. Realizing the isolated was in danger being besieged by the enemy and thus suffering possible annihilation, the nationalists wisely decided to abandon Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) on November 25, 1947, and retreated toward Wuyang (舞阳), and the campaign concluded with Square City (Fang Cheng, 方城) fell into the enemy hands for a third time, and this time for good.
Outcome.
The nationalists suffered more than 12,000 fatalities in their defeat, and a total of eighteen cities and towns had fallen into the enemy hands. In addition, the enemy had successfully turned the guerilla base in the Funiu Mountain into a new communist base, furthermore, the enemy was successful in establishing several brand new communist bases and thus further threatened the nationalist reign in the North China Plain. The communist success was mainly due to the correct strategy of first luring the technically superior nationalist opponent into dispersing its forces into many smaller fragments, and then to concentrate overwhelmingly numerically superior force in one battle on a single fragmented nationalist force for annihilation, and eventually, accumulate many small victories into large ones. The result of the communist strategy was that a total of eighteen towns and cities fell into the communist hands, and the communists had established themselves firmly in the border areas of Henan, Hubei and Shaanxi provinces.

Slovak Air Force (1939–45)

The Slovak Air Force ("Slovenské vzdušné zbrane", or SVZ), between 1939 and 1945, was the air force of the short-lived World War II Slovak Republic. Its mission was to provide air support at fronts, and to protect Bratislava and metropolitan areas against enemy air strikes. These units supported Axis Powers offensives in Ukraine and Russian Central front under the lead of Luftwaffe in the Stalingrad and Caucasus operations.
One of their first air battles was during the Hungarian reoccupation of the Carpatho-Ruthenia area on March 1939 (see Slovak-Hungarian War), in which they suffered some losses against "Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierö" (Hungarian Air Force). They also participated in the Polish Campaign on September 1939. For the rest of the war, Slovak A.F. confronted USAAF and RAF during their raids against the country. The engagement in the Eastern Front resulted in great losses of aircraft and personnel.
The symbol of the Slovak air force was a white-blue with red circle cross on tail and wings amongst yellow paint in engine cover and vertical line in fuselage.
The aircraft for training was supplied by Germany and Italy. To defend Slovak air space, the air force used Messerschmitt 109 (E and G types), Avia B-534, and some other interceptor types. It was also helped by Luftwaffe units active in the area.
When Romanians and Russians entered Slovakia, with some captured aircraft and defectors they organized local Insurgent Air Force to continue their fight against Axis forces in country, others served voluntarily in Luftwaffe units; later these air units were integrated to National Air Force after the end of the war.

Iron filings

Iron filings are very small pieces of iron that look like a light powder. They are very often used in science demonstrations to show the direction of a magnetic field. Since iron is a ferromagnetic material, a magnetic field induces each particle to become a tiny bar magnet. The south pole of each particle then attracts the north poles of its neighbors, and this process repeated over a wide area creates chains of filings parallel to the direction of the magnetic field. Iron Filings are used in many places including schools where they test the reaction of the filings to magnets.
History.
Filings are mostly a byproduct of the grinding, filing, or milling of finished iron products, so their history largely tracks the development of iron. For the most part, they have been a waste product.
Iron filings have some utility as a component in primitive gunpowders. In such a fine powdered form, iron can burn, due to its increased surface area.
In modern electronics, some transformers have iron powder cores.
Uses.
The primary utility of iron filings is in the study and teaching of magnetism and electromagnetic fields. The substance makes impressive demonstrations when sprinkled on a white card placed on top of a permanent magnet. The filings are also found in toys that allow one to draw with a magnetic pen. Additionally, by sprinkling fine iron on a magnetic stripe card, it is possible to see the magnetic encoding on the stripe. Another demonstration is to pour onto the exposed platter of a hard drive a semi-viscous fluid in which iron filings are suspended, so that the patterns of bits on the platter are revealed by the alignment of the iron filings.
Iron filings are also used to fortify enriched foods for human consumption. However, it is known that pure iron in its metallic form is not processable by the human body, it will simply be excreted. It has to be absorbed in another form such as a ferric salt.

Downfield F.C.

Downfield F.C. are a Scottish junior football club based in the Downfield area of Dundee. Their home ground is Downfield Park.
Up until the end of the 2005–06 season, they played in the Tayside Premier League of the Scottish Junior Football Association's Eastern Region.
The SJFA restructured prior to the 2006–07 season, and Downfield found themselves in the twelve-team East Region, North Division. They finished third in their first season in the division.
Downfield are the current East Region North Division champions, winning the 2010-11 campaign by 2 goals from North End, and in terms of trophies won are second only to Tayport in the Tayside / North District roll of honour. The Scottish Cup, along with the more recently created East Region Cup and Tayside/Fife Cup are the only honours to elude the club. The Spiders side which won the Tayside League three times in a row at the end of the 1980s is generally considered to be the best footballing side in Tayside's recent history.
The club's name, "The Spiders", comes from the same term applied to Queen's Park FC. This is due to Downfield playing in the same narrow black-and-white hooped strip as Scotland's oldest club. When Downfield were first founded, Queen's donated a set of strips to them to assist with the start-up. 
Downfield Park is situated in the Kirkton area of Dundee. The far side has a covered enclosure named after Eric Clark, a long-serving committee member now deceased. The south side of the ground contains the club's Social Club, incorporating the changing facilities. The west end has recently seen a flattening of the earth banking at that end, with a view to eventual construction of new facilities. The ground also occasionally plays host to Tayside Police's football side.

Por Estas Calles

Por Estas Calles (English: "On These Streets") is a telenovela broadcast by Radio Caracas Televisión between 1992 and 1994. It was extremely popular in Venezuela, due to its very realistic approach to the day-to-day life of the country and local tone. It was the first Venezuelan program to give a realistic view of the corruption in political life, as well as the first to show the day-to-day life in the poor "barrios". For example, it showed the impact on poor people's lives of the intermittent water supply, showing community meetings and lovers' trysts cut short by the news that the water was on, sending everyone running to fill storage tanks and barrels.
It was considered by the Spanish edition of the magazine Rolling Stone as the 8th best show between the 100 Best TV Shows Ever in all Latin America. It is believed to be the longest telenovela ever produced in Venezuela.
History.
In early 1992 Venezuela was in a very unstable political situation. At the same time, RCTV was in a low-rating stage. The network decided to take the risk of making a story which took place in the poorest slums of the city in a realistic fashion.
"Por Estas Calles" began as a traditional telenovela called "Eva Marina". During the pre-production stage, however, the concept changed from a traditional romance to a more actual, street-related story. The original chapters were wiped and the history, now under its new name and concept, began its filming.
The telenovela was initially written by Ibsen Martínez, but he resigned six months later. It is believed that RCTV demanded him not only an extension (something very usual when a telenovela is very successful) but also a better ending for characters who were very popular but morally questionable, something he was not willing to do. Despite his absence, the telenovela lasted for another year under a team of scriptwriters, and when it ended it was still popular.
Por Estas Calles inspired a rival telenovela with similar themes, "El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios", produced by Marte TV and broadcast by RCTV rival channel Venevisión. But this telenovela was quickly recognized as a bad ripoff, was comparably tame and lasted much less.
Plot.
There was not a central story in "Por Estas Calles". At the beginning, the main story revolved around the tribulations of elementary teacher Eurídice Briceño, falsely accused of murder, who has to hide under a new identity. But the other characters soon took bigger screen time, and it became an ensemble story. During its runtime, "Por Estas Calles" adapted many stories inspired by news headlines.
One of the show's characters, Don Chepe Orellana, "bore a striking resemblance to former president Jaime Lusinchi, who in real life had of course been manipulated by Blanca Ibáñez. On the show, Don Chepe and his mistress Lucha pocketed public money with one sleight-of-hand move after another, doled out favors to campaign contributors, developed all kinds of illegal schemes to hold on to power, and ruthlessly eliminated political enemies."
Characters.
The cast was one of the greatest and most memorable in the entire history of Venezuelan telenovelas. Many actors made their big leap to fame with this telenovela, although some of them never escaped from the type of characters they played for this production.
Some of the most popular characters were:
Controversy and Legacy.
The telenovela was initially received less than warmly. Many show-business journalists placed little confidence on the success of such a story, which was so radically different from both the classic soap opera and the then relatively new movement of "Telenovela Cultural".
The telenovela was surrounded by a lot of controversies, mostly related to an alleged glorification of violence and crime, and with the ripped-off-the-headlines late nature of the story. One of the most notable controversies was related to a boy actor who played a street kid and who became a precocious criminal.
The success of Por Estas Calles allegedly drove many independent producers into financial ruin, including the then powerful rival Marte TV, which attempted to produce a rival telenovela with similar themes titled "El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios". Unlike Por Estas Calles, El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios was not a success, and lasted only a few months.

Superdance

Superdance is a twelve hour danceathon held to raise money for treatment and research for children with Cystic Fibrosis. It is held annually at Bishop O'Connell High School and has raised over $4 million since 1976. Superdance is one of the largest High School fund-raising events in the United States, and until recently was the largest fund-raising event for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
History.
Superdance was created in 1975 by Monsignor James McMurtrie to help raise money to find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis, which had caused the death of Brenda O'Donnell, an O'Connell student, in 1975. Her sister, Maura O'Donnell, who also suffered from CF, helped start Superdance in her sister's honor. Maura later graduated from Bishop O'Connell and began nursing school, only to die a few weeks before her graduation of Cystic Fibrosis.
The Dance.
Each year, the O'Connell senior class has attempted to top the previous year's fundraising total. The record is currently held by Superdance 2001, when $178,000 was raised prior to and the day of Superdance, with an additional $18,000 raised after the dance, totaling $196,000. The next highest total of $186,000 was raised in 2006. In 2007, the goal was to raise $200,000 in the hope of breaking the three million dollar mark for the total amount collected; that goal was met. Nearly 98% of Bishop O'Connell's students attend Superdance, and it has become a unifying event for the school. At the dance, students receive a Superdance t-shirt, which is worn during the dance, creating a sea of identically-shirted dancing students. The dance is run almost entirely by students on committees, who provide nearly all the labor. The dance is advertised on local news stations and radio stations, as well as on a website, www.superdance.org[http://www.superdance.org].

Ryan Jordan

Ryan Jordan is a pioneer of the modern-day ultralight backpacking movement and founder of Backpacking Light Magazine.
Background.
Jordan began his backpacking as a member of a Boy Scout troop in Burien, Washington. Jordan earned his Eagle Scout Award in 1986. In the late 1980s, he became involved at Camp Parsons on its staff, eventually becoming its High Adventure Director. In this role, Jordan instilled an ultralight backpacking paradigm among teenage Scouts, leading them in the Olympic Mountains on five-day treks of 80 miles or more, often off-trail. Jordan became known for causing angst among Scouts' parents entrusting their children to his care, but gained a reputation for developing and leading an exciting program that became the envy of local hiking clubs and mountaineers. Jordan and his Scouts completed many ascents of remote Olympic peaks, difficult off-trail traverses, and long distance treks in the Olympic Mountains, often with Spartan packs weighing less than ten pounds (not including food and water).
Career.
Jordan holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Environmental Engineering from Washington State University and a Ph.D. in Biofilm Engineering from Montana State University. In his professional career, which included a stint at Montana State University as a research scientist, he conducted research related to groundwater and surface water microbiology and engineering, which led to a research program in Backcountry Health and Science. The program gained national media attention in the late 1990s and early 2000s for its involvement of undergraduate research fellows in wilderness science. Among the topics Jordan and his students studied included the efficacy of backcountry water treatment technologies (for recreation and military use), antibacterial efficacy of synthetic fiber coatings vs. merino wool fibers used in performance base layer apparel, and the prevalence and distribution of pathogenic bacteria in wilderness surface waters.
Backpacking light movement.
In 2001, Jordan founded "Backpacking Light Magazine" on the premise that science and engineering principles should be used to educate consumers about making smart decisions for buying and using ultralight gear. "Backpacking Light Magazine", and Jordan's book "Lightweight Backpacking and Camping" are recognized as the most authoritative references about ultralight backpacking available, and stand in contrast to other important, but more biased works, including Ray Jardine's critically acclaimed book "Beyond Backpacking".
Jordan uses the term ""Super-ultralight backpacking" to describe a style of ultralight backpacking undertaken with a pack weight of less than five pounds (2.3 kg). In addition, Jordan is well known for promoting a style of backpacking by which long distances are walked without outside assistance or resupply. His own efforts have included more than seven 300+ mile treks without resupply, mostly taken in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of the Northern U.S. Rocky Mountains, including a circumnavigation of the Wind River Range, two north-to-south traverses of the ecosystem.
With Roman Dial and Jason Geck, Jordan attempted a 600+ mile traverse of the Western Arctic in June 2006 without resupply, beginning at the coastal village of Kivalina. Their starting pack weights (including food) were about 55 pounds each. After 185 miles, Jordan injured an ankle and was flown to Kotzebue by a bush pilot. Geck continued to Anaktuvuk Pass, a distance of 550 miles from Kivalina, and Dial reached the Alaskan Oil Pipeline Highway, a distance of 624 miles from Kivalina. This trek was the first successful attempt by any party to complete a foot traverse of America's most expansive roadless wilderness without resupply.
Scouting Contributions.
Jordan has been involved in the Scouting movement for 35 years as a youth and leader. As a young Hikemaster at Camp Parsons in the early 1990s, he mentored a group of 15-17 year old Scouts in the Camp Parsons Silver Marmot Program on a circumnavigation of the Olympic Range over a distance of 145 miles in 5 days, that included an ascent of Mt. Constance and first ascents of several obscure satellite peaks en route that hadn't been climbed since the 1920s and 1930s. Jordan took $175 of his own money for one Silver Marmot trek to purchase army-surplus packrafts and made what may have been the first packrafting descent of the Hoh River in 1991 with a group of teenagers following a traverse of the Bailey Range. Jordan was known to say that "this was the most exciting adventure I've ever done, only because the participants, myself included, were full of youth and ignorance, and lacked duct tape for packraft repair, causing us to end at the Pacific Ocean with 8 of us crammed into 5 boats."
Jordan was the Scoutmaster for Troop 676 in Bozeman, Montana, and is currently the High Adventure Chair for the Montana Council of the BSA. Jordan is a nationally-renown proponent and educator for the "Scouting Renaissance", a movement to restore rigorous study and integrity back into the Patrol Method, High Adventure Expeditions, Advancement, Adult Integrity, and Youth Leadership.
Personal life.
Jordan lives in Bozeman, Montana.

School history.
Springville's school honors the name of Archibald Griffith who raised a seminary from a position of uncertainty to one of proud equality with any in the land. In 1867 the name of the Academy was changed to Griffith Institute, in consideration of his liberal donation. Later he gave $10,000 to the Institute.SGI History Article
Springville-Griffith Institute CSD Campus
There are approximately 1,800 students enrolled in the four schools that comprise the Springville-Griffith Institute Central School District. Springville Elementary (K-5) is located in Springville and Colden Elementary (K-5) in Colden, with average class sizes in the low 20's. Griffith Institute Middle School (Grades 6-8) and Griffith Institute High School (Grades 9-12), are both located in Springville, with average class sizes in the low 20's. The District Office and bus garage, which houses the District's fleet of 45 school buses, are also located in Springville.
School Governance
The School is governed by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. The remaining actions are set through policies of the Board of Education (BOE). For the purposes of the school, policies have the force of law. Policies are voted on by its five members. Every action must carry with three votes, even if not all five members are present. Members of the Board of Education are elected to terms of three years and serve without pay. They are responsible for district finances and for formulating educational and school district policies. The Board holds meetings at least monthly on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. at the high school at 290 North Buffalo Street unless otherwise announced.

Lewisia

Lewisia is a plant genus, named for Meriwether Lewis who encountered the species in 1806. The native habitat of "Lewisia" species is north facing cliffs in the western part of North America. Local Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats. 
Characteristics.
Lewisias are perennial alpine plants native to western North American. They produce rosette-shaped flowers that may be one of a range of different colours. "Lewisia cotyledon" grow up to in height and width.
Most species of "Lewisia" are deciduous, including the original "Lewisia rediviva"; "Lewisia longipetala" is the only semi-deciduous species. Some species, such as "Lewisia cotyledon", are evergreen.
Taxonomy.
Meriwether Lewis is credited with the first discovery by a European or American of "Lewisia", which was known to the local Native Americans as bitterroot. Lewis discovered the specimen in 1806 at Lolo Creek, in the mountain range that became known as the Bitterroot Mountains. The plant was given its scientific name, "Lewisia rediviva", by Frederick Traugott Pursh.
List of species.
There are nineteen species and several varieties of "Lewisia", including:
Distribution and habitat.
Lewisias are naturally found in western parts of North America. In their native habitat of north facing cliffs, Lewisias are subject to extremes in weather conditions.
Uses.
All species of "Lewisia" are edible. "Lewisia rediviva" has a large edible root and as a result became a food source for local Native Americans. The root is peeled before boiling or steaming; cooking the root reduces its bitterness. 
"L. rediviva" has also been used for medicinal purposes; chewing the root was used to relieve a sore throat. It has also been used to promote milk flow during lactation.
For gardening, "Lewisia" species are usually planted in rockeries because this mimics their natural habitat. Rockeries also provide the free drainage that Lewisias need to prevent their roots rotting. They may also be planted in pots, though they need to be well drained and protected from sustained wet weather.

Giorgi Ugulava

Giorgi "Gigi" Ugulava () (born August 15, 1975) is a Georgian politician and the former Mayor of Tbilisi (2005–2013). He is one of the leaders of the formerly ruling and now opposition United National Movement (UNM) party and a close ally of the former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili. 
Early career.
Born in Tbilisi, Ugulava studied at the Tbilisi Theological Seminary (1992-4) and the University of Saarbrücken (1995-7), and graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology at the Tbilisi State University in 1998. Having briefly worked as a journalist for a Tbilisi-based Iberia TV, Internews, and Transparency International (1997-9), he became a consultant for the Eurasia Foundation in 2000. He directed the World Bank Association of Legal and Public Education from 2001 to 2003, and helped organize the youth organization Kmara! ("Enough"). The Kmara movement played a critical role in the bloodless Rose Revolution, which would bring the reformist leader Mikheil Saakashvili to power. Ugulava assumed the position of Deputy Security Minister in the new government and was moved to the post of Governor of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti in September 2004. On April 20, 2005, he was appointed Chief of the Administration of the President of Georgia. 
Mayor of Tbilisi.
Ugulava was appointed Mayor of Tbilisi on July 12, 2005. When this post became elective in 2006, he ran successfully for mayor, and was elected by the Tbilisi Assembly on October 12, 2006 and re-elected through a direct vote on May 30, 2010. After the UNM-dominated central government was defeated by the Georgian Dream coalition in the 2012 parliamentary election in 2012, Ugulava was suspended, on 22 December 2013, from his functions by a court for alleged misuse of funds. He was arrested in July 2014 on charges of money laundering in the funding of his party's campaign in June municipal elections. His supporters accused the government of politically motivated persecution of Ugulava.

Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain

In mathematics, in the field of abstract algebra, the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups and roughly states that finitely generated modules can be uniquely decomposed in much the same way that integers have a prime factorization. The result provides a simple framework to understand various canonical form results for square matrices over fields.
Statement.
When a vector space over a field "F" has a finite generating set, then one may extract from it a basis consisting of a finite number "n" of vectors, and the space is therefore isomorphic to "Fn". The corresponding statement with the "F" generalized to a principal ideal domain "R" is no longer true, as a finitely generated module over "R" need not have any basis. However such a module is still isomorphic to a quotient of some module "Rn" with "n" finite (to see this it suffices to construct the morphism that sends the elements of the canonical basis "Rn" to the generators of the module, and take the quotient by its kernel.) By changing the choice of generating set, one can in fact describe the module as the quotient of some "Rn" by a particularly simple submodule, and this is the structure theorem.
The structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain usually appears in the following two forms.
Invariant factor decomposition.
For every finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain , there is a unique decreasing sequence of proper ideals formula_1 such that isomorphic to the sum of cyclic modules:
The generators formula_3 of the ideals are unique up to multiplication by a unit, and are called invariant factors of "M". Since the ideals should be proper, these factors must not themselves be invertible (this avoids trivial factors in the sum), and the inclusion of the ideals means one has divisibility formula_4. The free part is visible in the part of the decomposition corresponding to factors formula_5. Such factors, if any, occur at the end of the sequence.
While the direct sum is uniquely determined by , the isomorphism giving the decomposition itself is "not unique" in general. For instance if is actually a field, then all occurring ideals must be zero, and one obtains the decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space into a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces; the number of such factors is fixed, namely the dimension of the space, but there is in a lot of freedom for choosing the subspaces themselves (if ).
The nonzero formula_3 elements, together with the number of formula_3 which are zero, form a complete set of invariants for the module. Explicitly, this means that any two modules sharing the same set of invariants are necessarily isomorphic. 
Some prefer to write the free part of "M" separately:
where the visible formula_3 are nonzero, and "f" is the number of formula_3's in the original sequence which are 0.
Primary decomposition.
The elements formula_14 are called the "elementary divisors" of "M". In a PID, nonzero primary ideals are powers of primes, and so formula_16. When formula_17, the resulting indecomposable module is formula_18 itself, and this is inside the part of "M" that is a free module.
The summands formula_19 are indecomposable, so the primary decomposition is a decomposition into indecomposable modules, and thus every finitely generated module over a PID is a completely decomposable module. Since PID's are Noetherian rings, this can be seen as a manifestation of the Lasker-Noether theorem.
As before, it is possible to write the free part (where formula_17) separately and express "M" as:
where the visible formula_22 are nonzero.
Proofs.
One proof proceeds as follows:
This yields the invariant factor decomposition, and the diagonal entries of Smith normal form are the invariant factors.
Another outline of a proof:
Corollaries.
This includes the classification of finite-dimensional vector spaces as a special case, where formula_27. Since fields have no non-trivial ideals, every finitely generated vector space is free.
Taking formula_28 yields the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.
Let "T" be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space "V" over "K". Taking formula_29. The last invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and the product of invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial. Combined with a standard matrix form for formula_30, this yields various canonical forms:
Uniqueness.
While the invariants (rank, invariant factors, and elementary divisors) are unique, the isomorphism between "M" and its canonical form is not unique, and does not even preserve the direct sum decomposition. This follows because there are non-trivial automorphisms of these modules which do not preserve the summands.
However, one has a canonical torsion submodule "T", and similar canonical submodules corresponding to each (distinct) invariant factor, which yield a canonical sequence:
Compare composition series in Jordan–Hölder theorem.
For instance, if formula_32, and formula_33 is one basis, then
formula_34 is another basis, and the change of basis matrix formula_35 does not preserve the summand formula_36. However, it does preserve the formula_37 summand, as this is the torsion submodule (equivalently here, the 2-torsion elements).
Generalizations.
Groups.
The Jordan–Hölder theorem is a more general result for finite groups (or modules over an arbitrary ring). In this generality, one obtains a composition series, rather than a direct sum.
The Krull–Schmidt theorem and related results give conditions under which a module has something like a primary decomposition, a decomposition as a direct sum of indecomposable modules in which the summands are unique up to order.
Primary decomposition.
The primary decomposition generalizes to finitely generated modules over commutative Noetherian rings, and this result is called the Lasker–Noether theorem.
Indecomposable modules.
By contrast, unique decomposition into "indecomposable" submodules does not generalize as far, and the failure is measured by the ideal class group, which vanishes for PIDs.
For rings that are not principal ideal domains, unique decomposition need not even hold for modules over a ring generated by two elements. For the ring R = Z[√−5], both the module R and its submodule M generated by 2 and 1 + √−5 are indecomposable. While R is not isomorphic to M, R ⊕ R is isomorphic to M ⊕ M; thus the images of the M summands give indecomposable submodules L1, L2 < R ⊕ R which give a different decomposition of R ⊕ R. The failure of uniquely factorizing R ⊕ R into a direct sum of indecomposable modules is directly related (via the ideal class group) to the failure of the unique factorization of elements of R into irreducible elements of R.
Non-finitely generated modules.
Similarly for modules that are not finitely generated, one cannot expect such a nice decomposition: even the number of factors may vary. There are Z-submodules of Q4 which are simultaneously direct sums of two indecomposable modules and direct sums of three indecomposable modules, showing the analogue of the primary decomposition cannot hold for infinitely generated modules, even over the integers, Z.
Another issue that arises with non-finitely generated modules is that there are torsion-free modules which are not free. For instance, consider the ring Z of integers. Then Q is a torsion-free Z-module which is not free. Another classical example of such a module is the Baer–Specker group, the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which large cardinals exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.

Every Extend Extra Extreme

Every Extend Extra Extreme, also known as E4, is a game for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service released on October 17, 2007. It is an expanded version of the popular PlayStation Portable game "Every Extend Extra" which is, in itself, an expanded version of the 2004 freeware title "Every Extend".
The game runs in high-definition 1080i and supports 5.1 surround sound. It supports online multiplayer; Achievements; Leaderboards and GamerScore support; and online competitive modes.
Gameplay.
Gameplay is simple: the player controls a ship which they can detonate at any time. This causes any enemies within a certain radius to explode, which in turn cause other enemies to explode in a chain reaction. As the game continues more and more enemies populate the screen allowing longer and higher scoring explosions. The player may halt the chain at any time to pick up power-ups (such as to increase enemy speed, add time, add temporary shield) or to start a new chain reaction.
The explosions add a percussive beat to the background music.
The player's ship is destroyed when coming into contact with or being shot by an enemy while the player's shields are down. This resets the level to its initial slow pace and bonus multiplier, therefore hindering the player's scoring.
Types of games.
It contains four modes of gameplay:
E4: The Game Time Unlimited
E4: The Game Time Limited
S4: Wiz ur Musik (aka Sonic DSP Sound Spectrum Synthesizer)
R4: The Revenge (aka Rhythmic Rolling Revenge Revolution)

Jean-Louis Calandrini

Jean-Louis Calandrini (August 30, 1703 – December 29, 1758) was a Swiss scientist. He was a professor of mathematics and philosophy. He was the author of some studies on the aurora borealis, comets, and the effects of lightning, as well as of an important but unpublished work on flat and spherical trigonometry. He also wrote a commentary on the "Principia" of Isaac Newton (published in Geneva, 1739–42), for which he wrote approximately one hundred footnotes.
The genus "Calandrinia" was named after him.
His father was a pastor, also named Jean-Louis, and his mother was Michée Du Pan. He is the grandnephew of Bénédict Calandrini. In 1729, he married Renée Lullin. At the Academy of Geneva, he obtained his thesis in physics (1722). In 1724, Calandrini was named mathematics professor at the same time as Gabriel Cramer, but he first undertook a three year journey to France and England. He was appointed professor of philosophy from 1734 to 1750. He also played an active role on the political scene of Geneva.

Givi Targamadze

Givi Targamadze (born 23 July 1968) is a Georgian politician in the United National Movement. An ally of Mikhail Saakashvili, Targamadze was one of the leaders of the United National Movement and the 2003 Rose Revolution. He served as Defense and Security Committee Chairman of the Georgian Parliament from 2004 to 2010, a period marked by tensions with Russia and a brief 2008 war over the breakaway province of South Ossetia.
On 5 October 2012, the Russian channel NTV aired a documentary titled "Anatomy Of A Protest 2", which claimed to show secret footage of Targamadze meeting with Russian opposition activists Sergei Udaltsov and Leonid Razvozzhayev to plot the overthrow of President Vladimir Putin. Targamadze and Udaltsov both claimed that the documentary had been faked.
Role in "color revolutions".
He is closely allied with President Mikhail Saakashvili, and in 2003, was one of the leaders of the Rose Revolution which forced the resignation of long-time president Eduard Shevardnadze, allowing Saakashvili to assume the office. He also traveled to Ukraine during the 2004 Orange Revolution, in which Viktor Yushchenko assumed office following an annulled presidential election found to have been fraudulent, and to Kyrgyzstan during the 2005 Tulip Revolution, which overthrew President Askar Akayev. In March 2006, Belarus accused him of a role in "an alleged election-day terror plot aimed at overthrowing the government", a claim the Associated Press described as "widely dismissed as scare tactics".
Defense and Security Committee Chairman.
From 2004 to 2009, Targamadze served as Defense and Security Committee Chairman of the Georgian Parliament, during which time he frequently criticized the Russian government and military. In August 2004, Targamadze showed footage to journalists of Russian military forces moving to the border of the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a breakaway Georgian province that had declared independence. He called for a greater Georgian military build-up in response, calling Russian aggression "evidently unavoidable". In March 2005, he urged the Georgian government to develop a plan "to prevent any movement on Georgian territory by Russian servicemen" if Russia failed to withdraw from its two remaining military installations on Georgian territory. In May, following a unanimous vote by the Georgian Parliament to force the closing of the bases by 2006, he warned that Russia would face sanctions followed by more severe measures if it failed to withdraw.
In July 2005, Targamadze accused Russia of "taking a direct part in an internal conflict in Georgia" through as many as 120 military intelligence agents on sabotage missions. In November, Russia initially denied him a visa to travel to St. Petersburg for a Commonwealth of Independent States meeting, causing the Georgian delegation to boycott the gathering. When the Russian State Duma banned Georgian and Moldovan wine imports in April 2006, Targamadze described the decision as "revolting". 
In April 2008, when Russia stated that it would consider military action if Georgia came into conflict with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another breakaway province, Targamadze condemned the statement as "aggressive" and "a direct threat to Georgia". Following an unsuccessful August war in South Ossetia, in which Georgian troops had been quickly repulsed by Russian forces, Targamadze headed negotiations for the release of Georgian prisoners. In November, when Erosi Kitsmarishvili, a former Georgian ambassador to Russia, testified before a parliamentary committee that Georgia had been responsible for the war, Targamadze threw his pen at the man and had to be restrained from attacking him.
Targamadze joined his party in November 2007 in criticizing former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili, who accused Saakashvili of corruption after leaving office. Targamadze described the remarks as a "ploy" by opposition candidate Badri Patarkatsishvili. Later that month, he announced that the government was suspending the broadcasts of pro-opposition television stations Imedi and Kavkasia as part of a state of emergency declared by the president.
"Anatomy Of A Protest 2".
On 5 October 2012, Russian pro-government news channel NTV aired a documentary titled "Anatomy Of A Protest 2", which accused Russian opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov, Udaltsov's assistant Konstantin Lebedev, and Leonid Razvozzhayev, a parliamentary aide to Russian opposition MP Ilya V. Ponomaryov, of meeting with Targamadze for the purpose of overthrowing Putin. The documentary purported to show a low-quality secret recording of a meeting between Targamadze and Russian activists, which NTV stated had been given to its staff "on the street by a stranger of Georgian nationality". The Investigative Committee of Russia (SK) stated it had found the footage to be genuine, while bloggers debated its validity, stating that at least one fragment of footage was used twice with different voice-overs. Targamadze stated he had not met Udaltsov, and dismissed the video as "propaganda" without further comment. Razvozzhayev attempted to apply for asylum in Kiev, Ukraine through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, but was allegedly kidnapped and returned to Moscow. Udaltsov, Razvozzhayev, and Lebedev were subsequently charged with plotting riots, carrying a potential ten-year prison sentence.

Picrate

A picrate is a salt or an ester of picric acid (a 2,4,6-trinitrophenol). But it could also be an additional compound which picric acid forms with many aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, aliphatic amines, alkalines, and other compounds. These additional compounds are also called picrates even though they are not a salt of picric acid.
The picrate ion has yellow color. Many picrates are explosives, for example ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite). Some are used as primary explosives, namely lead picrate or potassium picrate which find their use as primers for cartridge ammunition. Ferrous picrate is used in some applications as a diesel fuel additive to achieve better mileage.
Picrates of some metals tend to be significantly more sensitive to impact, friction and shock than picric acid itself. As a result, storage of picric acid (or mixtures containing it) in metal containers is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of accidental explosion.

Thomas John Clagett

Thomas John Claggett (October 2, 1743 – August 2, 1816) was the first bishop of the newly formed American Episcopal Church, U.S.A. (previously known as the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U.S.A.) to be consecrated on American soil and the first bishop of the recently established (1780) Episcopal Diocese of Maryland.
Early family life.
Thomas Claggett, born October 2, 1743, was the son of the Reverend Samuel Clagett, an Anglican priest of the Church of England from Charles County, Maryland, and Elizabeth Gantt. He was the great grandson of Captain Thomas Clagett who emigrated from England and settled on St. Leonard's Creek in Calvert County, Maryland in 1671. 
Captain Clagett at one time owned more than in Calvert, Prince George's, Baltimore and Kent Counties. He was a Justice and Coroner of Calvert County and an opponent of Maryland Governor John Coode, who was a leader of Coode's Rebellion. Thomas John Claggett was the first to use the double "g" in spelling his family's name.
Education.
After Claggett's father died in 1756 when he was 14, he was placed in the care of his maternal uncle, the Rev. Dr. John Eversfield. Eversfield was the "historically conspicuous" rector of St. Paul's Parish Church in Prince George's County, Maryland. Three years later Thomas Clagett began attending public school and enrolled at the Lower Marlboro Academy in Lower Marlboro, Maryland, founded by Rev. Eversfield on his plantation around 1745. Many of the youth in southern Maryland were educated at Eversfield's school. Claggett later served the parish from 1778-1780 and succeeded his uncle until 1786.
In 1762, at age 17, he entered the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University). He graduated on 25 September 1764 and received theological training from Dr. Eversfield for the next three years. In 1787 Princeton conferred on him the "Master of Arts" degree, and in 1792, after he was ordained and consecrated as the first American Episcopal Bishop, he was awarded the Doctor of Divinity from Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland on the state's Eastern Shore, where the Diocese had been formed twelve years before in 1780.
Religious appointments.
On 20 September 1767, while visiting in Great Britain, he was made an ordained deacon in the chapel of Fulham Palace, by the then Bishop of London, Dr. Richard Terrick, Lord Bishop of Peterborough. Less than a month later, at the same place and by the same prelate, Thomas was made a priest on 11 October 1767. He remained in England for about three more months, studying and visiting family. In the spring of 1768, he returned home, and was appointed as the Rector of All Saints' Church of Sunderland, Calvert County, Maryland.
Local service.
The American Revolutionary War created tremendous conflicts within the Church of England in the Thirteen Colonies. The clergy, who had been ordained in England, had taken an oath of allegiance to the king. Soon after the Declaration of Independence, the clergy were required to sign an "Oath of Fidelity", which none felt they could sign without violating their ordination vows. Nine of the clergy gave up their congregations and returned to England, six moved to Virginia, one to Pennsylvania, one to Delaware, five retired to their estates, and two or three others took up teaching. Starting July 4, 1776, Congress and several states passed laws making prayers for the king and British Parliament acts of treason. By 1779 the numbers of Anglican clergy in the area dwindled from 53 to just 15. Divisions and conflict arose among largely “loyalist” clergy and overwhelmingly “patriot” parishioners. 
Claggett avoided the conflict, retiring as rector and living on his estate of Croom in Prince George's County for two years. In 1778, he began officiating in his local home parish at St. Paul's, in Baden, of Prince George's County where he became rector on August 7, 1780, succeeding to the office after the death of his uncle, Rev. Dr. John Eversfield. He remained there until 1786. In 1786, he moved to the parish at St. James' Church (formerly Herring Creeke Church) at Tracy's Landing (now near Lothian) in Anne Arundel County.
Organization of American Church.
Following the Revolutionary War, the Rev. William Smith was elected bishop of the Maryland diocese, but the Bishop of London refused to consecrate Smith. Unable to obtain consecration of their clergy from the Church of England, representatives from nine dioceses already organized met in Philadelphia in 1789 to form an independent Anglican church in America and ratify a constitution for its governance. 
The Anglican congregations in nine states adopted the name of the "The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America" as their name in 1789 and formally separated itself from the Church of England. Using the term "Episcopal" emphasized their belief and usage of the historical succession by the "laying-on-of-hands" of the "Episcopacy" and the "episcopate" rather than the descriptive term "Anglican" which emphasized their English origins and the mother church of the Church of England. In later times the word "Episcopal" would be used by other churches that became branches of the world-wide Anglican Communion like the Scotland).
The American Episcopal Church was incorporated as “the first Anglican Province outside the British Isles.” At the time in 1783, there were 47 parishes and about 38 clergy in the new first Diocese.
Consecration as bishop.
"Being a man of excellent fitness for the office, as well as possessed of large private means," he was elected the first Bishop of Maryland, and was consecrated at the triennial General Convention (synod) of the Episcopal Church at Trinity Church on Wall Street in New York City on 17 September 1792. Thomas J. Claggett was the first bishop of the Episcopal Church ordained and consecrated in America and the fifth Bishop consecrated for the Episcopal (formerly Anglican) Church in the United States.
Consecrators.
Claggett was consecrated by four men who had been the presiding bishops consecrated by the Bishop of London. They were:
The first priest (presbyter) ordained by Claggett was the Rev. Walter Dulany Addison, who became rector of King George's Parish, which included a few Episcopalian families in Georgetown in the western portion of the new District of Columbia. These services were held on 'M' Street in the local Presbyterian Church through the hospitality of the minister, the Rev. Stephen B. Balch. From this initial work, the Diocese formed the Georgetown Parish in 1809.
United States Senate Chaplain.
On November 27th, 1800, the United States Senate at its first session in the new, barely serviceable Capitol building selected the Right Reverend Claggett as its third Chaplain. He gave the opening prayer, the first offered in the new Capital in Washington D.C. He served through the end of the session. 
His first group of confirmations, a class of forty-four, took place in 1793 at St. John's Church at Broad Creek, near today's Fort Washington overlooking the Potomac River, in Prince George's County a few months after his consecration, and were presented by the then third rector, the Rev. Joseph Messenger.
Trinity Episcopal Church.
In 1810, members of the church in Upper Marlboro, Maryland founded Trinity Episcopal Church so they could worship near their homes. The nearest existing Anglican churches were St. Thomas Church in Upper Marlboro and St. Barnabas' Church in Leeland, both long carriage rides over rough and often impassible roads. 
On August 13, 1810, the newly formed Vestry elected the Right Rev. Thomas John Claggett as the first rector of Trinity Church. He organized the congregation in an abandoned wooden Presbyterian building built 106 years earlier in 1704. During the War of 1812, notes from the vestry minutes of May 1814 describe British troops camping in the church and preventing the Vestry from meeting. Rev. Clagget served as rector of the congregation until his death on August 3, 1816.
Other congregations.
The Rev. Father Claggett was the second rector of Christ Episcopal Church, Guilford, Maryland (1781–1782). On October 16, 1811, he consecrated the replacement structure at Christ Church, also known as the "Old Brick Church", in Queen Caroline Parish, western Anne Arundel County (now town/city of Columbia in Howard County). On January 9, 1814, he consecrated a rebuilt Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia (home parish of General and President George Washington, (1732-1799). An assistant bishop was appointed in 1814. He published a few sermons, pastoral letters, and addresses to his convention.
He was among the first to envision the need for a national Episcopal Church in the nation's new capital, Washington D.C., in 1793. While presiding over his Diocesan convention that year, he appointed a committee to study the idea. He had an ally in Joseph Nourse, the country's First Registrar of the Treasury. However, Nourse did not want the cathedral in downtown Washington, but even then foresaw the beautiful dominating hill-top of Mount Alban overlooking the city. After years of controversy about its location, construction of the Washington National Cathedral on Mount Saint Alban was begun in 1897, and mostly completed by the 1980's.

Claggett died August 4, 1816, at Croome, in Croom, Maryland, his family home, which burned on December 25 of 1856 or 1858. Originally interred in the family plot on the property, his remains were moved in 1898 to Washington National Cathedral, then beginning construction where a wood carving of his consecration was added to the bishop's stall. There is a marker and memorial bell tower at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, in Croom, Prince George's County, Maryland. Many of his papers are housed at the Diocese of Maryland's archives.
Claggett's epitaph, which includes the dates of his ordinations, was penned by his friend and fellow churchman, lawyer-poet Francis Scott Key, author of the "Star Spangled Banner".
Remembrances and Legacy.
The Diocese of Maryland in Frederick County built a summer camp and later retreat center known as the "Claggett Center". It serves the recreational, physical education, and spiritual needs of young Episcopalians. It is also a retreat and conference center for members and guests of the Church and Diocese.
St. James School outside Hagerstown in Washington County, built a large boys dormitory they named "Claggett Hall". It also contains offices for the headmaster, admissions, and business divisions, and a common dining room.

Huseyn Javid

Huseyn Javid (), born Huseyn Abdulla oglu Rasizadeh (24 October 1882, Nakhchivan – 5 December 1941, Shevchenko, Tayshetsky District), other spellings "Husein Javid," was a prominent Azerbaijani poet and playwright of the early 20th century. He was one of the founders of progressive romanticism movement in the contemporary Azerbaijani literature. He was exiled during the Stalin purges in the USSR.
Life and career.
Huseyn Abdulla oglu Rasizadeh was born in 1882 to a family of a theologian in Nakhchivan in the Iravan Governorate. After completing his elementary education at a religious school in 1898, Javid pursued his mid-school education in the Maktab-i Tarbiya of Mashadi Taghi Sidgi. In 1899–1903, Huseyn Javid studied in the Talibiyya Madrasah in Tabriz. After obtaining a degree in literature at the Istanbul University in 1909, Javid worked as a teacher in Nakhchivan, Ganja and Tiflis, and starting from 1915 in Baku.
Huseyn Javid's first book of lyrical poems titled "Kechmish gunlar" ("The Past Days") was published in 1913. However Javid was known more as a playwright. His philosophical and epic tragedies, and family dramas introduce a new line of development in Azerbaijani literature. In his literary tragedy "Sheikh Sanan" (1914), Huseyn Javid philosophized about the idea of a universal religion to lift inter-religious barrier between humans. His most famous creation, "Iblis" ("The Satan") written in 1918, exposed all oppressive forces as the supporters of "humans are wolves to each other" philosophy and "the 20th century cultural savages", and summarized them in the character of Satan. In his works, Javid criticized any form of colonialism and oppression.
During the 1920s and 1930s, Huseyn Javid authored a number of historical epics, such as "Peyghambar" ("The Prophet") in 1922, "Topal Teymur" ("Timur") in 1925, "Sayavush" ("Siyâvash") in 1933 and "Khayyam" ("Khayyám") in 1935.
Arrest, exile and death.
Huseyn Javid wrote during the time of Collectivization and Stalin purges in the Soviet Azerbaijan. In the worst times of totalitarianism, he refused to serve as propagandist of "revolutionary socialist achievements". Javid was arrested in 1937 on trumped-up charges of being a "founding member of a counter-revolutionary group that was plotting an overthrow of the Soviet power".
His arrest was a part of the nation-wide campaign of purge against intelligentsia. The Soviet government exiled Huseyn Javid to the Far East to the city of Magadan. He died on 5 December 1941 in the village of Shevchenko (Tayshetsky District). Huseyn Javid was officially exonerated in 1956. His repatriation came only on Javid's 100th birthday in 1982, when his remains were moved from Shevchenko back to his homeland of Nakhchivan and reburied in a mausoleum built in Javid's honor.

Joseph Margolis

Joseph Zalman Margolis (born May 16, 1924) is an American philosopher. A radical historicist, he has published many books critical of the central assumptions of Western philosophy, and has elaborated a robust form of relativism.
His philosophical affinities include Protagoras, Hegel, C.S. Peirce, John Dewey, Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.V. Quine.
Biography.
Joseph Margolis was the son of central European, Jewish immigrants. His father, a dentist, was a well-read man, greatly interested in literature, and proficient in four languages.
Before dedicating himself to philosophy, Margolis served in World War II as a paratrooper. He was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge, and lost his only brother, a twin, in the same engagement. He studied at Columbia University, earning both the M.A. (1950) and Ph.D (1953) in philosophy. Famous contemporaries at Columbia included the art theorist Arthur C. Danto and the philosopher Marx Wartofsky.
Margolis has taught at numerous universities in the United States and Canada, as well as lecturing throughout Europe, in Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. Since 1991 he has held the Laura H. Carnell Chair of Philosophy at Temple University, Philadelphia. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.
Philosophy.
Introduction.
As set out in "Historied Thought, Constructed World" (California, 1995), Margolis holds that philosophy is concerned principally with three things:
He sees the history of philosophy concerning these three questions of reality, knowledge and ethics as a gradual movement away from the idea that any of these three realms is changeless and towards an increasing acceptance of real change infecting all three spheres. Margolis emphasizes that legitimation is philosophy's principal task.
Margolis defends the Protagorean dictum that "man is the measure of all things", arguing that all changeless first principles must give way to consensual, though not criterial, truth claims. Since "man", the measure, is himself a creature of history, no modal claims of invariance can possibly be sustained. Margolis further avers that there need be no fixities either "de re" or "de dicto" or "de cogitatione". The world is a flux and our thought about it is also in flux. Margolis sees the whole history of Western philosophy as a struggle between the advocates of change and those who either, like Parmenides, deny that change is intelligible, or those, like Heraclitus, who find some logos or law which allegedly governs whatever changes are admitted. He has argued that cognitive privilege of the changeless lingers even in relatively pragmatic philosophy such as the work of W.V. Quine. Nonetheless, Margolis proposes possible modes of legitimation even under the ubiquity of flux. Contrary to postmodern philosophers like Richard Rorty or Jean-François Lyotard, he argues that our lack of cognitive privilege means that the need for philosophical justification becomes more, not less, pressing.
Margolis began close to the so-called analytical school of English-speaking philosophy but his mature work draws freely on both analytic and Continental philosophy. In large part this disciplinary eclecticism reflects his ambition to overcome the apparent opposition between the naturalist tradition of analytic philosophy and the humanistic tradition of Continental philosophy.
To achieve this, Margolis treats the "natural" as ontologically prior to the cultural, while emphasizing that we only know nature via cultural means, hence, that the cultural is epistemologically prior to the natural. This position is developed at length in his "Selves and Other Texts" (Penn State, 2001).
His philosophical pursuits, expressed programmatically, are:
Themes.
Margolis has published more than thirty books, on a variety of topics in philosophy. In "Historied Thought, Constructed World" (California, 1995), he argues that philosophy uncritically adopts the Platonic-Aristotelian view that "necessarily, reality is invariantly structured and, when known, discernibly known to be such". Beginning with his counterproposal - "(2.1) It is not in any way conceptually necessary that reality possess invariant structures or an invariant nature" - Margolis gradually traces out an alternative view. For instance, Margolis argues that Aristotle's discussion of the principle of non-contradiction presupposes the changelessness of individual things rather than providing any proof of the alleged law. In Margolis's view non-contradiction applies to "sentential formulas" and not to "meaningful sentences", since discourse in use may always offset any seeming contradiction via re-interpretation, as is routinely done in science (for instance, in the case of the wave theory versus the corpuscular theory of light). In other words, there is no conceptual necessity to accept a strictly bivalent logic; our logics depend, in a deep sense, on what we pre-thinkingly take the real world to be like. Hence, there is no reason to disallow relativism at all, for the world may well be the kind of place where incongruent judgments - judgments which on a bivalent reading would be "true" or "false", but are now no longer so, adhering to a many valued logic, one consisting of more than two exclusive truth-values - are all that creatures such as ourselves may ever hope to legitimate.
Margolis goes on to examine reference and predication as our ability to probe and communicate the results of our probings. Constative discourse – the making of statements of fact — for instance need only rely on identification, and reidentification, of items for it to prove effective in use. Therefore, historical memory and consensus, together with a narratizing ability, are all that are necessary to ensure the stability of what we make reference to, there need be nothing essential at all in things themselves, for our constative discourse to be able to flourish and even thrive. Margolis inveighs against postmodernists of Rorty’s stamp, claiming that they risk disabling constative discourse in their objectivist fears of privilege. There need be, according to Margolis, no conceptual privilege involved in making statements, nor in the justifications proferred for the statements made.
Still, Margolis emphasizes that justifications cannot be dispensed with, as any statement implies a whole set of beliefs about the way the world is and about how we know that. We must legitimize our statements as best we can, else we should never know why we should choose some over others, nor should we know how to proceed to make other statements building upon, but going beyond, our original exemplars.
The key to how we in fact "go on" is to be found in Margolis's major postulate of "Historied Thought, Constructed World": "Thinking is a History". Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical. Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being. It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories. Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and fixities to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions.
Margolis acknowledges that the historized "nature" of the human—and therefore of truth, of judgment, of reality, and the rest - is not his own discovery, but criticizes most previous versions of historicism as falling victim to some theological or teleological yearning, as in Hegel's "Geist", Marx's utopianism, or Heidegger's history of being. In Margolis's view, the truth claims of earlier historical epochs are given their historical weight, from our own historical present, our own truth claims regarding theirs are subject to our own bias and blindness, but ours must still be legitimated as best we can legitimate them, taking into account as far as humanly possible – though never overcoming - our limited horizon via self-critique.
Margolis claims that five philosophical themes have gathered momentum from the time of Kant on. They are:
He embraces all five themes separately and conjointly, defends them all, and concludes that our future investigations of ourselves and of our world risk ignoring them at our own peril. His own investigations into "ourselves" have proceeded with a focus on a consideration of the arts as an expression of human being. In "What, After All, Is a Work of Art" (1999) and "Selves and Other Texts" (2001), he elaborated upon his earlier work on the ontological similarity between human persons and artworks. The latter
– defined as "physically embodied, culturally emergent entities" – he treats as examples of "human utterance". Margolis argues that the cultural world is a semantically and semiotically dense domain, filled with self-interpreting texts, acts and artifacts.
Affinities and critique.
Margolis has philosophical affinities with Hegel, Marx, Peirce, John Dewey, the later Wittgenstein, and Michel Foucault. From Hegel and Marx, he takes on their historicism without their teleologisms, or theories of some historical goal. From Peirce, he takes the idea of Secondness, the brute thingness of things which guides our sense of reality. With Dewey, he shares the conviction that philosophy should never exceed "natural" bounds. With Wittgenstein, he holds that "what has to be accepted, the given, is – so one could say - forms of life" (PI; 226). Finally, Margolis sees Foucault's "historical a-priori" as a fair replacement for Kant's transcendental a-priori.
Margolis has extensively criticized what he sees as scientism in philosophy, singling out thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, Paul Churchland, Jerry Fodor, and Daniel Dennett as modern-day defenders of invariance.

Cuxton

Cuxton is a village in the unitary authority of Medway in South East England. It was, until 1998, part of Kent and is still ceremonially associated via the Lieutenancies Act. It lies on left bank of the River Medway in the North Downs. It is served by the A228, and Cuxton railway station on the Medway Valley Line between Strood and Maidstone. A low valley leads up from the river to the hamlet of Lower Bush.
History.
Archaeological evidence suggest the first human occupation was around 200,000 years ago. A hoard of 196 handaxes from the Acheulian era was excavated in 1962. This is now displayed in the British Museum. The name is believed to have developed from "Cucula's stone".
Remains of a Roman villa was found under the church yard. The Saxons occupied the village and it became known as Cuckelstane. The church and parish was given by Æthelwulf, King of the West Saxons to the Cathedral church of St. Andrew, Rochester. The church contains much Norman architecture, and is unusual as it lies on a southeast northwest axis. This gave rise to the rhyme, "He that would see a church miswent / Let him go to Cucklestane in Kent."
In Tudor times the principal house in the village was Whorne's Place, erected on the river by Sir William Whorne, Lord Mayor of London in 1487. This was later owned by Sir Joseph Levinson (1556-1615) the privateer. This was taken over by the Mashams, strong royalists who moved on to the Mote in Maidstone. The mansion was demolished in 1782 and only an outlying granary, now a house still bearing the name Whorne's Place, survives in 2011.
The only other manor in Tudor Cuxton was that of Beresse or Beresh, now known as Bush. It doesn't survive.
In 1610, William Laud was rector of Cuxton; he later became Archbishop of Canterbury under Charles I and was executed by the puritans in 1645 because of his strong royalist loyalties.
In Upper Bush there are four houses dating from 14th century and a Tudor Kentish Yeoman's house. A tin chapel from Cuxton was dismantled and re-erected at the Museum of Kent Life, Sandling.

Maurice Grosse

Maurice Grosse (6 March 1919 in London, England – 14 October 2006 in London, England) was a British paranormal investigator famous for his involvement in the Enfield Poltergeist case.
Early life.
Grosse was educated at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London. After serving an apprenticeship in commercial art and design, he served in World War II with the Royal Artillery and was among those evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940. Commissioned in 1941, he became responsible for the guarding and welfare of Italian prisoners of war for the remainder of the war. He married his wife Betty in 1944 and they had two daughters and a son. After the war, he became an inventor, and he filed the first of his many mechanical patents in 1945. His most successful invention was the rotating advertising billboard. In 1961 Grosse founded his own design and engineering consultancy business which became responsible for launching many patents throughout the world.
Psychical Investigator.
A personal tragedy launched Grosse into psychical research, when his daughter Janet was killed in a motorbike accident in August 1976. Following her death, members of Grosse's family experienced a number of coincidences and psychic happenings. These led him to join the Society for Psychical Research and the Ghost Club. In September 1977 he investigated a poltergeist in a house in Green Street, Enfield, North London. This became the famous Enfield Poltergeist case. Grosse supported the family for many months, staying at the house for long periods and recording many hours of cassette and video evidence of the phenomena. The poltergeist activity is summarised in the book "This House is Haunted" (1980), written by Guy Lyon Playfair, who also investigated the case.
A controversial aspect of the case was a voice resembling that of an old man but speaking through an 11-year-old girl who was the focus of the poltergeist activity. When the girl was accused by ventriloquist Ray Alan and others of faking the voice, Grosse offered £1,000 to anyone who could duplicate the voice by ventriloquism or any other form of trickery. No one took up his challenge.
Later life.
Grosse investigated many other cases, and served as a member of the Society for Psychical Research's Council, as well as being the long-serving Chairman of its Spontaneous Cases Committee. In 1995 Grosse was at a vigil in Charlton House when it was claimed that a piece of crockery materialised and shattered. In 2000 he again was able to record poltergeist knockings on videotape at the home of a family in north London. In addition to ghosts and poltergeists, Grosse also investigated numerous claims of precognition. He also put together an extensive collection of alleged examples of psychic photography. He continued this work right up until the summer of 2006.
Grosse appeared posthumously in Channel 4's documentary "Interview with a Poltergeist" which was transmitted on 6 March 2007. He also made an appearance on the Channel 4 mockumentary "Da Ali G Show" in which he was interviewed by Sacha Baron Cohen.
In 1998 Grosse sued David Baddiel for £10,000 after Baddiel had described a psychic investigator called Maurice Grosse who lives in High Barnet, North London, and runs away with a married woman. This was in Baddiel's novel, "Time for Bed". They settled out of court and Grosse gave his sizeable winnings to charity. After Grosse's death, in Baddiel's 2010 film, "The Infidel" he again introduced "Maurice Grosse, psychic investigator from High Barnet". This time the wife of Lenny Goldberg, played by Richard Schiff star of "The West Wing", had left Goldberg for the character Grosse.

Carpetani

The Carpetani (Greek: "Karpetanoi") were one of the Celtic pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania, modern Spain and Portugal), akin to the Celtiberians, dwelling in the central part of the "meseta" - the high central upland plain of the Iberian Peninsula.
Location.
Since the 5th century BC the Carpetani inhabited the Toledo and Alcaraz highland ranges along the middle Tagus basin, occupying a territory that stretched from the Guadarrama River at the north to the upper "Anas" (Guadiana) in the modern provinces of Guadalajara, Toledo, Madrid and Ciudad Real, an area designated as Carpetania in the ancient sources. Main city-states ("Civitates") in the region were "Toletum" (near modern Toledo; Roman or Celtiberian-type mint: "Tole"), "Complutum" (Alcalá de Henares – Madrid; Celtiberian-type mint: "Ikezancom Konbouto"?), "Consabura" (Consuegra – Toledo), "Barnacis" (Orgaz – Ciudad Real; Celtiberian-type mint: "Bornaiscom"), "Laminium" (Argamasilla de Alba or Alhambra – Ciudad Real) and "Alce" (Campo de Criptana – Ciudad Real). Towns of lesser importance were "Aebura" (Cuerva – Toledo), "Metercosa" (Madridejos – Ciudad Real), "Ispinum" (Yepes – Toledo), "Miaccum" (Casa de Campo – Madrid), "Mantua" (Montiel – Guadalajara), "Thermida" (Trillo, Guadalajara), "Ilarcuris" (Horche – Guadalajara) and "Ilurbida" (Lorvigo, near Talavera de la Reina – Toledo).
The exact location of the remaining Carpetanian towns is either uncertain or unknown, this is true in the cases of "Dipo" (near Toledo?), "Libora", "Varada", "Titulcia", "Caracca" or "Characa", "Rigusa", "Paterniana", and "Alternia".
Origins.
The Carpetani ruling elite certainly had Celtiberian and Gallic-Belgae elements, whose ancestors arrived to the Peninsula in the wake of the Celtic migration at the 4th century BC.
Culture.
In archeological terms, it is now believed that they stemmed from both the transitional Late Bronze Age/early Iron Age ‘Campiñas de Madrid’ farmers’ and the ‘Cogotas I’ cultural groups.
Only a few Carpetanian towns appear to have issued their own currency, modelled after Roman patterns copied directly or adapted via Celtiberian coinage. In the 2nd century BC, Complutum and Barnacis struck coins with their names marked in Celtiberian script, whilst later Toletum struck theirs bearing its name in Latin script.
History.
By the later part of the 3rd century BC, the Carpetani had evolved into a sort of federation or loose tribal confederacy whose nominal capital was set at "Toletum", with several centres of power in the main towns ruled by petty kings ("Reguli"). Some of these Rulers appear to have risen to prominence in the early 2nd century BC – one king Hilernus led a coalition of Carpetani, Vaccaei, Vettones and Celtiberians against Consul Marcus Fulvius near Toletum in 193 BC, but he was defeated in battle and captured; another "Regulus", Thurrus, ruler of Alce signed a treaty with Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus in 179 BC.
Prior to the Second Punic War, they opposed Carthaginian expansion in central Spain, but in 219 BC Hannibal defeated a combined force of Vaccaei, Olcades and Carpetani, thus completing his conquest of Hispania south of the Ebro with the exception of Saguntum.
They also provided mercenary troops to the Carthaginian armies, for Frontinus mentions the desertion of 3,000 Carpetani warriors from Hannibal’s army when he entered in Italy after crossing the Alps.

Michael Wright (born January 7, 1980) is an American-Turkish professional basketball player, currently with Turkish team Mersin BB. He also holds a Turkish citizenship. His Turkish name is Ali Karadeniz.
Wright played his high school basketball at Farragut Academy, where, as a freshman, he was part of one of the best teams in the country, which boasted future professionals Willie Farley and Ronnie Fields, as well as Boston Celtics superstar Kevin Garnett. At 2.01 m (6 ft 7 ¼ in), Wright played center after Garnett's departure, and moved to power forward in college. 
At the University of Arizona, Wright started for the Wildcats in the 2001 NCAA Division I championship against the Duke Blue Devils. However, undersized for that position at the pro level, and too slow to be a small forward,he dropped to the second round of the 2001 NBA Draft where he was drafted by the New York Knicks.
After not joining the Knicks or any other NBA team post-draft, Wright moved overseas and switched teams almost every season. He started with Polish league champions Śląsk Wrocław, that also participated in the Euroleague, moving to Spain's CB Granada the following year.
After the team was relegated to the LEB (Spain's second division), Wright moved to Israel and signed with Hapoel Tel Aviv, and a year later with ALBA Berlin.

Decision stump

A decision stump is a machine learning model consisting of a one-level decision tree. That is, it is a decision tree with one internal node (the root) which is immediately connected to the terminal nodes (its leaves). A decision stump makes a prediction based on the value of just a single input feature. Sometimes they are also called 1-rules.
Depending on the type of the input feature, several variations are possible. For nominal features, one may build a stump which contains a leaf for each possible feature value or a stump with the two leaves, one of which corresponds to some chosen category, and the other leaf to all the other categories. For binary features these two schemes are identical. A missing value may be treated as a yet another category.
For continuous features, usually, some threshold feature value is selected, and the stump contains two leaves — for values below and above the threshold. However, rarely, multiple thresholds may be chosen and the stump therefore contains three or more leaves.
Decision stumps are often used as components (called "weak learners" or "base learners") in machine learning ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting. For example, a state-of-the-art Viola–Jones face detection algorithm employs AdaBoost with decision stumps as weak learners.
The term "decision stump" was coined in a 1992 ICML paper by Wayne Iba and Pat Langley.European Conference on Machine Learning, Catania, Italy, April 6–8, 1994, Proceedings", Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) 784, Springer, pp. 231–241 ISBN 3-540-57868-4 Quote: "These simple rules are in effect severely pruned decision trees and have been termed "decision stumps" Iba and Langley".</ref>

Northfield Mountain

Northfield Mountain, , is a mountain ridge located in Erving and Northfield, Massachusetts. long by long, the mountain is composed of several distinct peaks and ledges, most notably Rattlesnake Mountain (also known as Farley Ledge) , Rose Ledges , and Hermit Mountain (the high point). A pumped-storage hydroelectric plant and reservoir occupies the top of the mountain west of the summit. 
The 114 mile (183 Km) Metacomet-Monadnock Trail crosses the summit ridge of Northfield Mountain; a series of shorter hiking trails, cross country ski trails, and rock climbing routes are also located on the mountain and its ledges. Northfield Mountain is located at the confluence of the Connecticut River and Millers River. A waterfall, Briggs Brook Falls, plunges from its southeast side.
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility.
The plant was built entirely underground, and located about up the Connecticut River from Turners Falls Dam. A stretch of the Connecticut River, extending some north from this dam to the Vernon Dam, Vermont, serves as the station's lower reservoir. During periods of lower electrical power demand, the plant pumps water from this lower reservoir through the Northfield Mountain Tailrace Tunnel to a man-made upper reservoir. At times of high demand, water is released to flow downhill from this upper reservoir through a turbine generator, where it then collects in the lower reservoir to be stored until again pumped to the upper reservoir.
Northfield Mountain's upper reservoir covers at above the river, with total storage of of water. Its underground powerhouse lies at below the surface and is accessible through a -long tunnel; it includes four large reversible turbines, each of which can pump about of water per second and generate 270,000 kilowatts of electricity.
The "lower reservoir" noted above is a pool along the Connecticut River above Turner's Falls Dam. Since the dam at Turner's Falls was raised in the early 1970s for Northfield Mountain, the banks of the Connecticut River have been re-adjusting to the new water level.
Recreation.
FirstLight Power Resources also manages recreational resources on the mountain as part of their agreement with the state of Massachusetts. A cross-country ski area is located on the mountain; it includes groomed trails, warming huts, and ski instruction. The 114 mile (183Km) Metacomet-Monadnock Trail traverses the mountain, as do a number of shorter trails. FirstLight also offers camping at nearby Barton Cove, environmental programs, and boat tours of the Connecticut River. 
Rose Ledge and Farley Ledges are popular among rock climbers. Farley Ledge has been subject to recent conservation and climbing access initiatives. Hermit Mountain is the site of "Hermit's Castle," a state historic site where John Smith, a local recluse, made his home from 1857 to 1900.
Geologic history.
Northfield Mountains' geologic story can begin in the late pre-Cambrian Period. The ancient pre-Cambrian rocks are more than 600 million years old and are found only in the Western Berkshires of Massachusetts and in the Green Mountains of Vermont.

Hawk MM-1

The MM-1 is a 40x46mm semi-automatic grenade launcher manufactured in the USA by the Hawk Engineering Company. The manufacturer claims that it has been used by US Special Forces units, as well as the military forces of several South American and African countries. Relatively heavy and bulky, the MM-1 can provide considerable firepower, with practical rate of fire as much as 30 rounds per minute. It can be useful in ambushes and other fast-paced close combat scenarios. 
While MM-1 may look much like a Milkor MGL grenade launcher with a larger cylinder, it was adapted from the Manville machine projector, a revolver-type 18-shot tear gas gun, developed in USA for police use before the Second World War. Michael Rogak, maker of the Rogak P-18 pistol, upsized the Manville design to 40mm and made certain design changes. One innovation was Rogak's development of a button rifling procedure for the aluminum barrel. This increased the speed of production while reducing costs. Subsequently, Rogak and a few others formed Hawk Engineering and began production of the MM-1. 
The MM-1 is a revolver-type weapon, with the heavy cylinder being rotated for each shot by the clockwork-type spring. The spring is wound manually during the reloading. To reload the cylinder, the rear part of the gun is released and rotated sideways to expose the rear of the cylinder, which is connected to the front part of the frame and barrel.

<doc id="9903218" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9903218" title="Wings Over Europe">
Wings Over Europe

Wings Over Europe is a PC game (Combat / Flight Simulator) set during the Cold War era where the USSR has attacked NATO forces in West Germany and thus turned it into a ‘hot war’.
The US release of the game is called "Wings Over Europe: Cold War Gone Hot", however, the tag line is changed to "Wings Over Europe: Soviet Invasion" for the European market. The time period covered is 1962 to 1984. 
The game includes a wide variety of real jets and weapons from the era which can be employed in various mission types such as Combat Air Patrol, Interception, Close Air Support, Iron Hand, Wild Weasel, and Reconnaissance.
The game is based on the "" engine and was developed by Third Wire Productions.
In 2009, an updated version for the Windows Vista platform called "Strike Fighters 2 Europe" was released. The original game, however, is still compatible with Vista and Windows 7.
Background.
"Wings Over Europe" was released in 2006 and was the fourth in a series of "Lite" Flight Simulators. The term "Lite" was applied because they are designed to be relatively easy to learn and play compared to other more hardcore types of flight simulator.
The developer took and improved on its existing "Strike Fighter"s game engine and thus the game was another step forward in terms of quality and game play. The game included better graphics, more planes, improved campaigns, and simulated clouds.
Game Play.
Despite the "Lite" tag, a fair amount of realism has been built in; 1960s-style bombsights are simulated for the pre 1970’s aircraft rather than modern computer-aided aiming reticules. Dive bombing and level bombing techniques have to be worked out by the game player if they are to have success at completing missions. 
Aircraft that come into service after 1970 have advanced Head Up Displays that allow the player to aim bombs with more accuracy than manual dive bombing techniques. Laser Guided bombs such as the GBU-12 Paveway are included; so are the A and B versions of the AGM-65 Maverick, allowing much easier ground target destruction for the late 1970s aircraft.
US Air to Air missiles in the game consist of versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-4 Falcon which are simulated to be as unreliable as the real missiles were. So regardless of having a "good lock on the target" there is a good chance the missile will miss. Missiles from 1978 onwards such as the AIM-9L version of the Sidewinder are much improved and more likely to score a hit.
Dogfights are usually close in affairs regardless of the time period, however as the Missiles get better over time, longer range kills can be achieved.
The map of Germany has been scaled down slightly so that there is less time spent flying to a target, and also because air-to-air refuelling is not included in the game. The lack of water on the map has meant that aircraft carrier operations have not been included this time. 
During a mission the player will fly in a flight of aircraft in which the computer-controlled planes keep in formation as you fly to a target. This flight can be issued commands; attack other aircraft or ground targets, fly home if they are damaged, or jettison their drop tanks. As you fly many other computer-controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets. 
Flying over Soviet held East Germany the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAMS), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAMs are the soviet SA-2 and SA-6, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly.
The player can select a fictitious campaign from either Red Thunder (1962), Red Hammer (1968), or Red Lightning (1979); each being from a different time era with different aircraft and weapons forcing the player to employ different tactics in each. 
Single Missions are also available, which can be customised to allow the player to practice with specific aircraft and weapons.
Featured aircraft.
The standard game comes with the following flyable allied aircraft:

Complete set of invariants

In mathematics, a complete set of invariants for a classification problem is a collection of maps
(where "X" is the collection of objects being classified, up to some equivalence relation, and the formula_2 are some sets), such that formula_3 ∼ formula_4 if and only if formula_5 for all "i". In words, such that two objects are equivalent if and only if all invariants are equal.
Symbolically, a complete set of invariants is a collection of maps such that
is injective.
As invariants are, by definition, equal on equivalent objects, equality of invariants is a "necessary" condition for equivalence; a "complete" set of invariants is a set such that equality of these is "sufficient" for equivalence. In the context of a group action, this may be stated as: invariants are functions of coinvariants (equivalence classes, orbits), and a complete set of invariants characterizes the coinvariants (is a set of defining equations for the coinvariants).
Realizability of invariants.
A complete set of invariants does not immediately yield a classification theorem: not all combinations of invariants may be realized. Symbolically, one must also determine the image of

Faith, Science and Understanding

Faith, Science, and Understanding is a book by John Polkinghorne which explores aspects of the integration between science and theology. It is based on lectures he gave at Nottingham University and Yale and on some other papers.
Publication information.
It was published in 2000 by Yale University Press ISBN 0-300-08372-6 and issued in paperback in 2001 ISBN 978-0-300-09128-1. There are 17 citations in Google Scholar [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&cites=10720196843939906329]
Synopsis.
In 1. Theology in the University Polkinghorne suggests that "the essential purpose of a University is the discovery and propagation of knowledge"(p4) and that universities are institutionalised expressions of the beliefs in the value of knowledge for knowledge's sake and the essential unity of all knowledge. He says that quantum theory illustrates the principle "Do not make common sense the measure of everything but be prepared to recognise aspects of reality in those modes that are intrinsic to their natures, however strange these modes may at first sight be."(p7). He argues that personal experience is a fundamental aspect of reality and that the human intuition of an infinite Reality is another fact about humanity and that one of the roles of theology is the intellectual study of the religious dimension of personal experience (p19), whilst theological metaphysics can offer a more profound understanding of reality (p22)
In 2. Motivations for Belief he rejects simplistic accounts of science, commending instead the approach of Michael Polanyi. He points out that the laws of nature operate all the time, but that understanding is only possible if we have access to regimes that are particularly transparent to our enquiry (p36) and suggests that God is always there, but there have been particular moments in history that have been unusually open to the divine presence, and that Scripture is "evidence", the record of foundational spiritual experience (p37). He expounds the doctrine of the Trinity and commends John Zizioulas's "Being as Communion".
In 3. The Role of Revelation he suggests that "revelation bears an analogy with the role played by observations and experiment in science" and that the pursuit of simplicity through studying extreme conditions (such as Deep inelastic scattering) is an important part of science. He also suggests that the fact that the Bible is still read with attention and spiritual profit by so many people so long after it was written is a fact that should be taken into account. (p56)
In 4. Design in Biology? he discusses the Anthropic Principle and in addition to the well-explored physicist perspective he commends the explorations of Michael Denton of properties of the physical world that seem to be tuned to life's necessities and the Nobel-prizewinner Christian de Duve's assertion "to Monod's famous sentence 'The universe was not pregnant with life, nor the biosphere with man,' I reply: 'You are wrong. they were.'" and also discusses with caution Michael Behe's claims about irreducible complexity.
In 5. Second Thoughts he modifies some of his earlier positions somewhat, especially in relation to multiverse theory.
In 6. Kenotic Creation and Divine Action he discusses Arthur Peacocke and the nature of causality
In 7. Natural Science Temporality and Divine Action he identifies "four different metascientific accounts of the nature of time, each claiming to derive from contemporary physics"
In 8. Contemporaries he discusses the ideas of Wolfhart Pannenberg, Thomas Torrance and Paul Davies
In 9. Science and Theology in England he sketches "the long English history of interaction between theology and science" from Robert Grosseteste via Francis Bacon, Thomas Browne and Robert Boyle, citing Charles Kingsley, Aubrey Moore and Frederick Temple who "all played an important part in welcoming the insights of Charles Darwin" and noting that the great British physicists of the 19th Century "Faraday, Maxwell, Kelvin and Stokes were all men of deep religious faith" (p198). He "feels that every German theologian writes with Kant looking over one shoulder and Hegel looking over another" whereas the English "tend to enjoy a more relaxed relationship with philosophy"(p202)

Rediscovering God in America

Rediscovering God in America is a book written by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with photography from his wife Callista Gingrich. and a film series based upon the book and narrated by the two Gingriches. The book was a New York Times bestseller.
Synopsis.
From the National Archives and Capitol Building to Arlington National Cemetery and Library of Congress, the Gingriches lead the reader on a tour of Washington, D.C. to point out the religious beliefs incorporated in the Nation's monuments. The role of religion in the United States' founding is examined and explained. Gingrich's tour is based in part on the controversial ideas of right-wing historian David Barton, which Bruce Wilson claims include "misleading and inaccurate claims".
Critical response.
"Publishers Weekly" found the book's argument "predictable", but praised the idea of basing the book on the tour of Washington, saying this "structure does much to freshen up a book that is otherwise indistinguishable from prior offerings". In "The New York Times", Andrew Ferguson said it "had the potential to be charming" and finds Callista Gingrich's photographs to be "lovely" and the book's production to be "elegant", but is otherwise scathing. "The New York Review of Books" commented it was "an item meant to be sold in the gift shops on the Mall as a sort of earphone substitute and eventual souvenir."
Film series.
Citizens United and Gingrich Productions have produced two "Rediscovering God in America" films, hosted by Newt and Callista Gingrich. Gingrich decided to make the film in part as a riposte to the success of liberal documentarist Michael Moore; he had the help of Citizens United's David Bossie who was an experienced maker of polemical films.
"Rediscovering God in America" was produced in 2008, with Newt and Callista Gingrich narrating as the book illustrates the importance of "our Creator" to our nation’s founders and their successors. Based on the New York Times bestseller, "Rediscovering God in America", this documentary seeks to remind viewers that the United States is indeed “One Nation Under God.”
By June 2011, the film had sold between 300,000 to 400,000 units. 
This second book in the series premiered in September 2009 at the Washington Visitor Center, hosted by the author and his wife. The film uses words of Samuel Adams, John Adams, Patrick Henry, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to support its argument. It explores “the role of religion in early States of America and the belief that ‘our Creator’ is the source of our liberty, prosperity, and survival as an exceptional nation. From the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown in 1607, through the American Revolution, to the end of the Civil War in 1865, this film tells the story of the deep faith that motivated and sustained our great leaders, and dramatically presents our nation’s belief in religious freedom.” In contrast to the first film, they are careful to talk about religion in general rather than privileging one faith. David Bossie of Citizens United called the film "a record correction, if you will, to the political correct folks out there who want to eliminate God from America"
Conferences.
Gingrich has also held a series of conferences around the USA on the themes of the book, including in Virginia Beach in 2009 and Iowa in 2011. Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, David Barton, and Haley Barbour addressed the Iowa conference. Speakers in Virginia included Ron Luce, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, David Barton, Oliver North, and Bob McEwen.

Aechmea mulfordii

Aechmea mulfordii (Living Vase Bromelia), which is native to Brazil, as well as the other plants in this genus are mostly epiphytic, which means that they live up in the branches of the trees and exist mainly on the moisture and nutrients they obtain from the air. However, "Aechmea mulfordii" is a large terrestrial plant, growing near the sea level on sand dunes.
"Aechmea mulfordii" has leathery green leaves ligulate or sword-shaped. The leaves may grow to 1 m (3ft) in length, at times much less, and form a central vase, which, in cultivation, should be kept filled with water. On this species, the primary bract greatly exceeds the lowermost branch. The flower-spikes sent up from the heart or crown of the plant are red panicle with the three outer sepaloid segments longer than the three inner or petaloid ones. Frequently confused with "A. rubens" and "A. emmerichiae", "A. mulfordii" has less dense and elaborate inflorescence than "A. rubens" and the long, broad floral bracts conceal the ovary.
Mythology.
The name of the genus "Aechmea" has been given by taxonomists because of the characteristically sharp points of the sepals and of the bracts covering the flower buds. The word "aechmea" comes from the Greek word "aichme" which means "spear tip".

The Moon Moth

"The Moon Moth" is a science fiction short story by American author Jack Vance, first published in 1961.
Plot summary.
Edwer Thissell, the new consul from Earth to the planet Sirene, has trouble adjusting to the local culture. The Sirenese cover their faces with exquisitely crafted masks that indicate their social status or "strakh". They also communicate by singing, accompanying themselves with one of a dozen musical instruments, selected based on the social situation. Furthermore, errors of etiquette may prove fatal.
The plenitude provided by the planet fosters individualism and the free time leads to intricacy in all aspects of Sirenese social life.
Thissell is a maladroit musician and lacks confidence in the alien society, so he is forced to wear a lowly Moon Moth mask. 
One day, he receives an alert to arrest a notorious assassin named Haxo Angmark, who is due on the next starship. Thissell, however, gets the message too late. He races to the spaceport, but Angmark, thoroughly comfortable with Sirenese customs, has already landed and disappeared. Thissell commits a number of serious social blunders in his haste to reach the spaceport and in enquiring after Angmark.
The next morning, Thissell is shown the body of an outlander. He concludes that, since the fugitive would be unable to pass himself off as a native, Angmark must have killed and taken the place of one of the handful of expatriates on the planet. But since even they wear masks, how is Thissell to know which one?
Eventually, Thissell solves the mystery by borrowing a slave from each of the suspects and determining their masters' mask preferences before and after Angmark's arrival. He succeeds in identifying his quarry, but is captured and forced to walk unmasked in public (the ultimate impropriety to the natives), while Angmark masquerades as Thissell, even to wearing his Moon Moth mask. However, the Sirenese turn on Angmark and kill him for the perversion of unmasking another man and, ironically, for Thissell's previous gaffes.
Thinking quickly, Thissell cleverly represents his humiliation as an act of unsurpassed bravery, asking if any present would be willing to be so shamed in order to destroy his enemy. With his new-found confidence, Thissell receives offers of gifts (the acceptance of which would enhance the prestige of both the giver and the recipient). He first goes with a mask maker to procure a covering more befitting his lofty new "strakh".

Themes in Torchwood

Science fiction program Torchwood discusses many themes in its narratives, specifically dealing with LGBT themes associated with its homosexual and bisexual characters and their problems, with various characters portrayed as sexually fluid. Certain characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, although the nature of Jack, Ianto and Toshiko's sexual flexibility is not discussed explicitly.
In addition to this, there is some discussion of the value of human life, the corrupting nature of power and of existentialism through parallels drawn between characters with the repetition of thematically important lines in the course of series one, although series two saw a significant shift from the original theme of corruption to one of redemption.
Homosexuality and bisexuality.
"Torchwood" deals with several LGBT themes, specifically bisexuality. Each of the main characters in "Torchwood" has same-sex encounters at some point in the first season, with "The Sun" describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual. Series creator Russell T. Davies has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters:
Davies has also said of Jack:
Similarly, Toshiko Sato describes Jack as someone who'll "shag anybody as long as they're "gorgeous" enough!". The essential Cult TV reader writes that because Jack, Owen, Ianto and Toshiko's homosexual dalliances occur "without any debate or angst", they form part of an attempt to "naturalize bisexuality", appearing to "deliberately refute and deny... gay, straight bi": "a progressive challenge to contemporary ideologies of sexuality".
In "Everything Changes", Ianto Jones jokingly refers to Jack's appreciation of his good looks in a suit as sexual harassment. In "Cyberwoman" the pair share a kiss, although it is essentially a kiss of life, it is not done in the normal way, and resembles a kiss of lust rather than of life. At the end of "They Keep Killing Suzie", Ianto subtly presents Jack with a sexual proposition, which the latter appears only to understand after a few seconds - he accepts by telling Ianto to meet him in his office in ten minutes, once the rest of the team have left the Hub. This is again alluded to in the "Instant Messenger Transcript" provided on the official website, which represents a conversation between the pair in the time remaining before their tryst. Ianto and Jack's relationship is referred to by Owen in "Captain Jack Harkness" when he calls Ianto Jack's 'part-time shag'. Their relationship is displayed for the first time in "End of Days" in which Ianto and Jack kiss after finding Jack is alive. Also during this episode, Ianto is clearly distraught when finding out Jack is dead, and smells his coat, reminiscent of gay cowboy film, "Brokeback Mountain". This relationship develops further in Series 2 with Jack asking Ianto out on a date ("Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"), the pair sharing an intense kiss ("To the Last Man") and Gwen walking in on them during some kind of sexual activity ("Adrift"). The other characters also allude to their relationship; most specifically Owen ("A Day in the Death") and Gwen ("Something Borrowed") and ("From Out of the Rain").
While Ianto becomes comfortable hinting on things going on while in bed with Jack around the other team members, he is uncomfortable to do so out of the Hub as shows.
In Series 3 he gets uncomfortable when strangers suggest that he and Jack are a couple, is offended when an elderly man under Torchwood protection refers to him as "the queer over there". At first he even tries to avoid the subject when talking to his sister, before confessing that while he is not attracted to men in general, he indeed has a relationship with Jack.
However, as the end of the 4th episode of "Children of Earth" suggest, Ianto was only able to tell Jack that he loved him when Ianto knew he was dying.
Earlier in "They Keep Killing Suzie", Jack claims to have had a sexual relationship with twin brothers, both acrobats; however, it is unclear whether he is speaking sincerely or simply trying to distract Gwen from asking difficult questions. However, in series two, Jack remarks to Owen that when you have been alive as long as he has "you don't make any more up" while they are in police custody in the episode "Dead Man Walking", implying that the many past relationships he refers to are genuine.
In "Captain Jack Harkness", a subplot of the episode revolves around Jack's namesake's sexual orientation. His uneasy behaviour and his dismay at having convinced his girlfriend that they were in love combined with his flirtatious interaction with Jack suggested he was gay and trapped in an unwanted heterosexual relationship, unable to come out in his era. At the episode's climax, at a dance and knowing he was going to die the next day, the two Jacks danced and kissed, to the amazement of the 1940s guests all around them, before they had to part.
In "Everything Changes", Owen Harper seduces a woman and then her boyfriend using alien technology. Gwen Cooper has a boyfriend, but she reciprocates the advances of a sex-driven alien in a woman's body in "Day One", albeit under the influences of alien-enhanced pheromones. Later in that episode, when the possessed woman attempts to absorb the orgasmic energy of various men at a sperm bank, one of them briefly protests that he's gay. Toshiko also exhibits bisexual behaviour: she has an interest in her teammate, Owen, but in "Greeks Bearing Gifts" she has a sexual relationship with "Mary".
Religion.
Existentialism.
Torchwood contains numerous existentialist themes including the meaning of life and the possibility of an afterlife. Suzie Costello tells Gwen in "They Keep Killing Suzie" that there is no meaning to life and that "we're just animals howling in the night." The nihilistic Mark Lynch describes his fellow regulars at the Weevil "fight club" as "ordinary blokes trying to find meaning in a world that doesn't have any" - hence their hobby of cage-fighting tortured captive Weevils. Mark Lynch tells Owen that the latter are not aliens but what "we" (i.e. humans, or perhaps only men) will be in a thousand years, "when we have nothing left but our rage." Toshiko also compares humans to Weevils when the pendant Mary gives her allows her to read minds causing her to fall into deep depression and utter disappointment with existence. 
The issue of mortality is also a common existentialist theme in Torchwood, raised through repeated discussion of and reference to the possibility or impossibility of an afterlife. For example, episode one features Jack questioning a recently deceased, though temporarily resurrected, man on the afterlife, who is shocked to discover he can remember nothing. Episode three, "Ghost Machine" presented the scientific view that ghostly phenomena were due to imprints of strong emotions on time. In "They Keep Killing Suzie", Suzie Costello, a recurring villain, states she can remember nothing having been resurrected. She says that "there's something moving in the dark" and it is after Jack. During episode eleven, "Combat", Mark Lynch also tells Owen about something coming "in the darkness." In episode ten, "Out of Time", Jack warns a suicidal man that on the other side there is absolutely nothing: "It just goes black." In episode 9 "Random Shoes", Eugene Jones dies but remains on earth as a ghost until he has saved the life of and subsequently kissed Gwen Cooper, with whom he was in love: this done, he is able to "move on", ascending - the final frame is black; it is left unclear what this symbolises. In "Dead Man Walking", having been resurrected, Owen remembers nothing but blackness during his time dead, but he also speculates that the living "aren't supposed to remember", explicitly suggesting for the first time that there might be more to the afterlife than the characters remember and they simply never recall it because their minds can't fully process it (Similar to how Spock told McCoy in "" that it would be impossible to discuss what he experienced while he was dead "without a common frame of reference").
In the season finale, "End of Days", Jack expresses existentialist sentiments regarding the religious referring to the apocalypse. Continuing the ghost theme carried in several episodes of "Torchwood", what appear to be the spirits of Lisa and Toshiko's mother appear, as well as Diane who may be dead or trapped in another time. Toshiko's mother warned of something "coming in the darkness", as Suzie Costello had done before. It is left unclear whether these were spirits or the machinations of the villain, Bilis Manger, as they urged Torchwood staff to do as he desired. In the episode's climax, biblical demon Abaddon is released from his prison beneath the Rift only to be defeated by Jack.
This is contrasting with optimistic themes presented in parent series "Doctor Who", where frequently the idea of life being "beautiful", and individual existence being significant is touched upon. Also contrasting in "Doctor Who" are the explicit examples of destiny and theism in the narrative, presented by the characters of the Black Guardian and White Guardian (both of whom are apparently representatives of an even higher power) and the Beast, who claims to have been imprisoned by a group called the 'Disciples of the Light,' a name that echoes traditional Christian and Zoroastrian theology.
Christian imagery.
Interestingly, although "Torchwood" has an existentialist view of life, there are several pointed moments with Christian symbolism. In one episode Captain Jack offers himself as a sacrifice to a satan figure to save the world, and his loyal followers wait faithfully for his resurrection. In the episode that explores how memory defines us, Jack's team sits around a large table in a tableau that recalls the Last Supper. One by one, Jack gives each the sacrament of a short term amnesia pill which will save them from the "death" of being filled with false memories that are threatening to forever alter their real selves. Of course, while Jesus said of his sacrament, "do this in memory of me", Jack's instructions are more along the lines of "take this and remember who you are." But it is clear that Jack's sacrifices, his deeply professed love of his entire team, and his ability to forgive them for their trespasses against him— even Owen who has actually shot and killed him— are Christ-like attributes. This idea was further reflected in "" where Jack was briefly returned to mortality while the rest of the human race were trapped in a state of immortality where they continued to age, get sick and sustain injuries without actually dying; in order to save the human race from this state of potential perpetual agony and the rule of the mysterious 'Three Families' who had triggered this immortality, Jack allowed Gwen to shoot him in the heart in the final episode, triggering the reversal of humanity's forced immortality without Jack knowing if his actions would also restore his immortality in the process.
Discussing similar themes in "Doctor Who", Russel T Davies stated:"The series lends itself to religious iconography because the Doctor is a proper saviour. He saves the world through the power of his mind and his passion."
Value of human life.
In several episodes, particularly revolving around the character of Jack Harkness, the value of human life is touched upon with Jack depicted as willing to sacrifice, murder and assist in suicide in several episodes. Episode four, "Cyberwoman", has him kill Ianto's girlfriend Lisa, with full certainty she was no longer human. In "Countrycide", he tells one of the cannibal villagers that he used to be a professional torturer, though of course this may simply be a lie calculated to intimidate the man. In "They Keep Killing Suzie", Jack riddles Suzie Costello with bullets, claiming responsibility for her death - "Death by Torchwood". It is implied that Jack would like to die, and he seems sympathetic when others wish to end their own lives: in "Out of Time" he holds the hand of a man who wants (but is afraid) to die, and in "Combat" he turns his back to allow Mark Lynch to surrender himself into the claws of a Weevil. Jack confirms his desire to die in "Utopia" when talking to the Tenth Doctor, but also states that seeing the Utopians as they fight to survive against all the odds has reminded him of what it means to be truly human. 
In the second season, continuing the idea of redemption in the series following Jack's reunion with the Doctor, his newfound appreciation for life is shown when he attempts to rescue the space whale from the group who have imprisoned it and are cutting up its flesh for meat, as well as his anger at Owen when Owen is forced to kill the creature out of mercy when it is further injured. In "Dead Man Walking", following his resurrection, Owen encourages a young boy dying of leukaemia not to give up on life no matter how scary the treatment might seem by telling him that sometimes death can be defeated. In the subsequent episode, "A Day in the Death", Owen convinces a woman not to commit suicide due to her grief over her dead husband by telling her that, if she can see even one faint glimmer of hope, life can't be as bad as she thinks. Although the team fails to prevent the Night Travellers from disposing of the last breaths of their victims in "From Out of the Rain", Jack nevertheless regards the mission as a success as they manage to save the life of a young boy, enthusiastically hugging the child after he awakens. Jack's compassion is further highlighted when he is shown to take care of those who have been sucked through the Rift in "Adrift", despite the fact that many of them have been horrifically physically and mentally damaged by what they have seen, preferring to help them enjoy the times when they are well rather than euthanise them. Despite his brother having become possibly hopelessly insane in "Exit Wounds", killing Tosh and (indirectly) Owen, Jack refuses to kill him after he has been defeated, instead putting him in cryopreservation in the hope of someday being able to help him, stating that there had been enough death that day. 
In "", the government concede to the 456's demands for ten percent of Earth's children as the alternative is to be completely destroyed, arguing that such a sacrifice is preferable to the alternative. The government previously sacrificed 12 children to the aliens in the 1960s in an effort to appease them, a project in which they had Jack's assistance. In the present day however, Jack refuses to give in to the 456's demands, constantly seeking an alternative solution as he claims "An injury to one is an injury to all. After the death of Ianto and the realisation that he is in no position to bargain with the 456, Jack agrees to sacrifice his own grandson Steven in order to kill the 456, also destroying his relationship with his daughter in the process.
Corruption.
Starting in episode one, with the character of Suzie Costello and continuing primarily with neophyte employee Gwen Cooper, the theme of corruption is present in the narrative, frequently drawing parallels between Suzie and Gwen. In the aforementioned pilot, Suzie comments on how you cannot go back from working for Torchwood, suggesting it has changed her, after she commits a series of murders and an eventual suicide. Later in the series, Gwen finds herself unable to tell her boyfriend Rhys about her double life, and finds herself drawn into a sexual relationship with teammate Owen in "Countrycide" - as had Suzie before her, revealed in "They Keep Killing Suzie". Gwen laments that as Suzie had said, Torchwood had changed her, and in "Greeks Bearing Gifts", she explained to Toshiko that she knew what she and Owen were doing was wrong, but that she had no intention of stopping. 
In "They Keep Killing Suzie", the team is shocked to learn that Gwen is the only person other than Suzie who possesses a sufficient degree of empathy to operate the resurrection gauntlet. A resurrected Suzie explains she would drug people with amnesia pills to tell them about her life - in "Combat", Gwen drugs Rhys as she confesses her affair with Owen so she can receive his forgiveness but not have to live with what she's done, echoing Suzie's actions. In the finale, "End of Days", after Rhys is murdered, Gwen fights Jack for the rift manipulator so that she may resurrect him, going as far as to hit Jack and even allow Owen to shoot him. In the episode's conclusion, with the rest of the team, she receives Jack's forgiveness as he understands she had been manipulated by villain, Bilis Manger.
Characters other than Gwen have had their morality tested. "Ghost Machine" depicts Owen filled with rage after experiencing a young woman's rape, capable of murdering her rapist. In "Combat", having lost his lover Diane, Owen succumbs to a nihilistic underground belly in which he attempts suicide-by-Weevil. In "Greeks Bearing Gifts" Toshiko, consumed with the loneliness of her job and feeling isolated amongst her peers, accepts a gift from an alien which allows her to read her co-workers' thoughts. Ianto, unable to let his dying girlfriend go, risks the life of his entire team in "Cyberwoman", even threatening to one day betray his future lover, Jack. In "End of Days", Jack berates his entire team for their destructive personal lives, at which point Owen shoots him, answering questions as to whether or not Owen is actually capable of murder.
Redemption.
By contrast to the first season, the second season focused significantly on the theme of redemption, as characters grew beyond past mistakes to become better than they were. The most obvious example of this is Gwen's relationship with Rhys, as she now willingly admits to him what she does for a living and subsequently refuses to slip him an amnesia pill, thus increasing his involvement in her life. Owen also shows himself to be capable of rising above his cynicism in the first season, realising after his death and resurrection that life can be a wonderful thing after he discovers a message from another civilisation who detected Earth's old attempts to contact extraterrestrial life and sent a response. Ianto is redeemed within season one's story arc, his deception with Lisa slowly fading away as he proves himself dedicated and loyal to the rest of the team. Jack in particular finally learns how to forgive himself for a past sin- when he accidentally lost his younger brother Gray during an alien attack- when he is reunited with his brother. Driven mad by his long imprisonment, Gray buries Jack alive for over eighteen hundred years before Jack is rescued by Torchwood and put into cryopreservation in order to ensure that the timeline proceeds unchanged. Despite having spent hundreds of years buried alive, Jack's first actions upon awakening in the present and seeing Gray are to forgive Gray for what he has done to him. Even when Gray states that he will never forgive Jack for losing him, Jack, refusing to give up hope on his brother, simply chloroforms him rather than killing him, leaving him in cryopreservation in the hope of someday being able to help him. 
Even characters outside the main cast demonstrate the ability to redeem themselves; the earliest example is Tommy Brockless, a WW1 soldier suffering from shell shock and destined to be executed for cowardice, who sacrifices his life in his present to willingly spend nearly a century in cryosleep to await the day when he will save the world in the future, overcoming his fear at the last minute, thanks to his love for Toshiko. Beth Halloran, a young woman whose fiance is apparently killed in an alien attack, is revealed to be a member of Cell 114, a group of alien sleeper agents who program themselves with the identities of the races they invade to learn their secrets, but Beth nevertheless overcomes her programming in order to help the team defeat her 'comrades' in the invasion, subsequently forcing the team to shoot her to prevent her possibly endangering them in the future.
However, the most prominent character to redeem himself is Jack's former colleague in the Time Agency, Captain John Hart, who originally appears as a merciless killer in "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", throwing Jack off a building and forcing the team to help him by threatening to blow up Gwen. However, in his return in "Fragments" and "Exit Wounds", his new attack on the team is revealed to be because he is being blackmailed by Gray to set off bombs throughout Cardiff and capture Jack due to Gray having molecularly bonded a bomb to his skin. With the bomb having been removed, John risks his life to help the team rescue Jack and defeat Gray, subsequently deciding to remain on Earth in the present and learn what Jack finds so fascinating about this time period. 
"" forces Jack to confront an old sin from his past, when he was involved in a trade effort that gave twelve orphaned children to a race known only as the '456', with the 456 having returned to Earth and now seeking larger numbers of children. Although Jack is able to save the world, he is forced to sacrifice his lover Ianto and his grandson Steven to do so, prompting him to leave Earth as he is unable to cope with his grief.
The "Doctor Who" episode "The Sound of Drums" revealed that the Torchwood institute itself has been 'redeemed' by Jack, with Jack having rebuilt the organisation in the Doctor's honour after the Battle of Canary Wharf and the Dalek/Cybermen war to be a more benevolent organisation that actively seeks to help humans and aliens in peril rather than regarding all aliens as enemies regardless of their motives for being on Earth.
In the spin-off novel "The Twilight Streets", the character of Bilis Manger also goes on to redeem himself, revealing that his intention in awakening the demon Abaddon was to provide Abaddon with the strength to defeat the beings known as 'The Dark', subsequently enlisting the aid of the Torchwood team to stop the Dark in Abaddon's absence. As with all spin-off media, the canonicity of these events is unclear.

Hallett Cove School

Hallett Cove School R - 12 (HCS) is a Reception to Year 12 public school located in the southern coastal suburb of Hallett Cove in Adelaide, South Australia. It was founded in 1987 to cater for years Reception to 10, expanding to cater for years 11 and 12 in 1996. The current principal is Mary Asikas, succeeding retired principal Peter Leverenz.
The school is separated into three levels: the Junior School (R-6), Middle School (7-9) and Senior School (10-12). The school offers co-curricular activities for students to learn leadership and team work skills, namely school representative council, year level management groups, zone sport and music. The senior school (Year 10) takes part in an annual skiing trip and the Rock Eisteddfod, in which the school won in 2000.
Brief history.
Late in 1984 the Southern Area Education Office commenced a program of consultation with the Hallett Cove community with the objective of establishing an R-10 school. In March 1985 a Parents’ Reference Group was formed and in September of that year established itself as an Interim School Council.
Hallett Cove School opened in February, 1987 as the only R-10 school in metropolitan Adelaide. Susan Monks was the school’s first Principal and there were 300 students from Reception to Year 7 on the first day of school. The school grew rapidly and classroom accommodation shortages and zoning issues were topics of conversation throughout 1988 - 89.
Dr Peter Jackson was the second Principal of the school and commenced duties mid-way through the 1990 school year. For the first time in its short history the school had all of its solid buildings available and all of its levels, R-10, in place.
An opening ceremony for the school occurred on 17 May 1991 with the Hon. Greg Crafter, Minister of Education attending. During 1991 a reference group recommended to the Minister of Education that Hallett Cove School provide Years 11 and 12 education. The decision to add senior secondary education to the school was made in 1992.
The school had its third principal, Jim Davies, appointed in 1993. Year 11 studies commenced in 1995 and Year 12 in 1996, making Hallett Cove School metropolitan Adelaide’s third R-12 school. A major building project occurred throughout 1995-96-97 to cater for the addition of the senior secondary curriculum.
The School celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2012.
School logo.
In 1988 the Principal Susan Monks, in conjunction with the School Council, initiated a search for a school logo. The brief was to have a simple symbol which reflected some aspect of Hallett Cove and the school. After a number of weeks and a large variety of ideas, the staff and parent bodies finally settled on our current design. It was designed by Art teacher, Dave Smith. The horizontal lines represent both the sea and the geological strata of the Hallett Cove Conservation Park and the sun as a symbolic reference to youthful aspirations as well as the visual beauty of our ocean view in the late afternoon.

Piano Concerto No. 5 (Mozart)

Piano Concerto No. 5 in D major, K. 175, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1773, at the age of 17. It is Mozart's first fully original piano concerto; his previous efforts were based on works by other composers.
Instrumentation.
The work is scored for 2 oboes, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings and was the only concerto with trumpets and timpani until No. 13, K. 415. The second movement omits the trumpets and timpani.
Movements.
The three movements of the concerto are listed as follows:
Unfolding with two whole notes, Mozart tackles a problem in the finale – how to introduce contrapuntal elements in a sonata form movement – that he was to revisit several more times. Mozart later composed a more tuneful rondo finale for this concerto, thinking it would be more popular with the Viennese audience than the original third movement.
This concerto was a favorite of Mozart's and is mentioned in many of his letters. He played the piece at concerts until the year of his death.

<doc id="9903342" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9903342" title="Norepinephrine">
Norepinephrine

Norepinephrine (INN) (abbreviated norepi or NE), also called noradrenaline (BAN) (abbreviated NA, NAd, or norad), or 4,5-β-trihydroxy phenethylamine is a catecholamine with multiple roles including those as a hormone and a neurotransmitter. It is the hormone and neurotransmitter most responsible for vigilant concentration in contrast to its most chemically similar hormone, dopamine, which is most responsible for cognitive alertness.
Medically it is used in those with severe hypotension. It does this by increasing vascular tone (tension of vascular smooth muscle) through α-adrenergic receptor activation.
Areas of the body that produce or are affected by norepinephrine are described as noradrenergic. The terms noradrenaline (from the Latin) and norepinephrine (from the Greek) are interchangeable, with noradrenaline being the common name in most parts of the world. However the U.S. National Library of Medicine has promoted norepinephrine as the favored name.
One of the most important functions of norepinephrine is its role as the neurotransmitter released from the sympathetic neurons to affect the heart. An increase in norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system increases the rate of contractions in the heart. As a stress hormone, norepinephrine affects parts of the brain, such as the amygdala, where attention and responses are controlled. Norepinephrine also underlies the fight-or-flight response, along with epinephrine, directly increasing heart rate, triggering the release of glucose from energy stores, and increasing blood flow to skeletal muscle. It increases the brain's oxygen supply.
Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine by dopamine β-hydroxylase in the secretory granules of the medullary chromaffin cells. It is released from the adrenal medulla into the blood as a hormone, and is also a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and sympathetic nervous system, where it is released from noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. The actions of norepinephrine are carried out via the binding to adrenergic receptors.
Medical uses.
Norepinephrine is used for hypotension.
Hypotension.
Norepinephrine is also used as a vasopressor medication (for example, brand name Levophed) for patients with critical hypotension. It is given intravenously and acts on both α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. Its effects are often limited to the increasing of blood pressure through agonist activity on α1 and α2 receptors, and causing a resultant increase in peripheral vascular resistance. At high doses, and especially when it is combined with other vasopressors, it can lead to limb ischemia and limb death. Norepinephrine is used mainly to treat patients in vasodilatory shock states such as septic shock and neurogenic shock, while showing fewer adverse side-effects compared to dopamine treatment.
Physiological effects.
Norepinephrine is released when a host of physiological changes are activated by a stressful event.
In the brain, this is caused in part by activation of an area of the brain stem called the locus coeruleus (LC). This nucleus is the origin of most norepinephrine pathways in the brain. Noradrenergic neurons project bilaterally (send signals to both sides of the brain) from the locus coeruleus along distinct pathways to many locations, including the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and the spinal cord, forming a neurotransmitter system.
Norepinephrine is also released from postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, to transmit the fight-or-flight response in each tissue, respectively. The adrenal medulla can also contribute to such post-ganglionic nerve cells, although they release norepinephrine into the blood.
Norepinephrine system.
The noradrenergic neurons in the brain form a neurotransmitter system, that, when activated, exerts effects on large areas of the brain. The effects are manifested in alertness, arousal, and influences on the reward system.
The noradrenergic neurons originate both in the locus coeruleus and the lateral tegmental field. The axons of the neurons in the locus coeruleus act on adrenergic receptors in:
On the other hand, axons of neurons of the lateral tegmental field act on adrenergic receptors in hypothalamus, for example.
This structure explains some of the clinical uses of norepinephrine, since a modification of this system affects large areas of the brain.
Role in cognition.
Cortical norepinephrine (NE) release during attention paradigms (patterns) can increase the alteration detection rate (frequency at which an alteration was selected) in multiple-cue probability learning during tasks involving giving predictive cues (such as auditory or visual), and thereby enhance subsequent learning. A. J. Yu et al. developed a Bayesian framework to examine NE release in instances of "unexpected uncertainty", wherein a drastic alteration in sensory information produces a large disparity between top-down expectations and what actually occurs. The model predicts that NE levels spike when the predictive context is switched, then subside. It has also been shown that lesions of the locus coeruleus impair this attentional shift.
Similarly, several studies have implicated the LC-NE system in eliciting the P300, a cortical event-related potential that responds to environmental stimuli with behaviorally relevant, motivational, or attention-grabbing properties. The P300 may reflect updating of prior knowledge regarding stimuli relevant for accurate and efficient decision making. Several studies have searched for a P300 generator within the brain and have ultimately concluded that the potential must have a source that is distributed, synchronous and localized in cortex. This definition is ideally satisfied both functionally and anatomically by the LC neuromodulatory system. Given its broad projection pattern and the correlation between NE release and increased sensory signal transmission, it seems likely that noradrenergic cortical release is the neuronal mechanism of the P300.
Examination of the LC’s tonic firing pattern has led to speculation that it is important for the exploratory behavior essential for learning relations between sensory input, decision processing, motor output, and behavioral feedback. Tonic activation within the range of 0–5 Hz has been shown to correlate with levels of drowsiness, accurate task performance, and, when slightly more elevated, distractibility and erratic task performance. Furthermore, phasic activation of the LC is observed in response to both highly salient, unconditioned and task-relevant stimuli. The phasic response occurs after stimulation and precedes a behavioral response in a time-locked fashion. As such, phasic activation of the LC-NE system is proposed to enhance signal processing and behavioral responses specifically to task-relevant stimuli. Given the contrasting functional roles of LC tonic and phasic activity, it is plausible that projections from this brain region are important for maintaining a balance between exploratory and goal-directed behaviors that regulate probabilistic, environmental learning and corresponding decision making.
The LC-NE system receives convergent input from the orbitofrontal (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). The OFC has been associated with evaluation of reward. For example, Tremblay et al. found that the response magnitude of single-units in this region is varied with the hedonic value of a stimulus. Additionally, neurons in this region are activated by rewarding stimuli, but not by identification of the stimulus nor corresponding response-preparation. Activation of the ACC appears to reflect some evaluation of cost-benefit. Several studies show ACC activation in response to performance error, negative feedback, or monetary loss. Additionally, ACC responds to task difficulty. Therefore, ACC activation may serve to integrate evaluations of task difficulty with corresponding outcome information to gauge the benefits of taking an action in regards to a particular environmental stimulus. Conceivably, the functions of the ACC and OFC are directly related to decision-making, and their projections to LC may modulate the phasic release of NE in order to gain-modulate cortical responses to decision outcomes.
LC-NE may play a significant role in synchronizing cortical activity in response to a decision process. In computational modeling of decision, the most accurate and efficient decision mechanisms are mathematically defined random walk or drift-diffusion processes that utilize single-layer neural networks to calculate the disparity in evidence between two options. NE release gated by the LC-NE system is elicited after neurons processing sensory information have presumably reached a decision threshold. Thus, the phasic burst can alter activation in all cortical processing layers in a temporally dependent manner, essentially collapsing the vast information-processing circuit to the outcome of a single-decision layer. Brown et al. found that the addition of a phasic LC mechanism was sufficient to yield optimal performance from a single-layer decision network.
Fasting.
A study has shown that fasting leads to increased levels of norepinephrine (NE) in the blood for up to 4 days of fasting.
Macronutrient intake.
Glucose intake was found to significantly increase plasma NE levels. In contrast, protein and fat intake was found to have no effect.
Drug interactions.
Different medications affecting norepinephrine function have their targets at different points in the mechanism, from synthesis to signal termination.
Synthesis modulators.
α-Methyltyrosine is a substance that intervenes in norepinephrine synthesis by substituting tyrosine for tyrosine hydroxylase, and blocking this enzyme.
Vesicular transport modulators.
This transportation can be inhibited by reserpine and tetrabenazine.
Receptor binding modulators.
Examples include alpha blockers for the α-receptors, and beta blockers for the β-receptors.
Termination modulators.
Uptake modulators.
Inhibitors of uptake 1 include:
Inhibitors of uptake 2 include:
Alzheimer’s Disease.
The norepinephrine from locus ceruleus cells in addition to its neurotransmitter role locally diffuses from "varicosities". As such, it provides an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. Up to 70% of norepinephrine projecting cells are lost in Alzheimer’s Disease. It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress Aβ-induced production of cytokines and their phagocytosis of Aβ, suggesting this loss might have a role in causing this disease.
Chemistry.
Norepinephrine is a catecholamine and a phenethylamine. The natural stereoisomer is L-(−)-("R")-norepinephrine. The prefix "nor-" indicates that norepinephrine is the next-lower homolog of epinephrine. The two structures differ only in that epinephrine has a methyl group attached to its nitrogen, whereas the methyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom in norepinephrine. The prefix "nor-" is derived as an abbreviation of the word "normal", used to indicate a demethylated compound.
Mechanism.
Norepinephrine is synthesized from tyrosine as a precursor, and packed into synaptic vesicles. It performs its action by being released into the synaptic cleft, where it acts on adrenergic receptors, followed by the signal termination, either by degradation of norepinephrine or by uptake by surrounding cells.
Biosynthesis.
Norepinephrine is synthesized by a series of enzymatic steps in the adrenal medulla and postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system from the amino acid tyrosine.
Vesicular transport.
Between the decarboxylation and the final β-oxidation, norepinephrine is transported into synaptic vesicles. This is accomplished by vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) in the lipid bilayer. This transporter has equal affinity for norepinephrine, epinephrine and isoprenaline.
Release.
To perform its functions, norepinephrine must be released from synaptic vesicles. Many substances modulate this release, some inhibiting it and some stimulating it. An action potential reaches the presynaptic membrane, which changes the membrane polarisation. Calcium ions thus enter, resulting in vesicular fusion, releasing norepinephrine.
For instance, there are inhibitory α2 adrenergic receptors presynaptically that give negative feedback on release by homotropic modulation.
Receptor binding.
Norepinephrine performs its actions on the target cell by binding to and activating adrenergic receptors. The target cell expression of different types of receptors determines the ultimate cellular effect, and thus norepinephrine has different actions on different cell types.
Termination.
Signal termination is a result of reuptake and degradation.
Uptake.
Extracellular uptake of norepinephrine into the cytosol is done either presynaptically (uptake 1) or by non-neuronal cells in the vicinity (uptake 2). Furthermore, there is a "vesicular uptake" mechanism from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles.
Degradation.
In mammals, norepinephrine is rapidly degraded to various metabolites. The principal metabolites are:
In the periphery, VMA is the major metabolite of catecholamines, and is excreted unconjugated in the urine. A minor metabolite (although the major one in the central nervous system) is MHPG, which is partly conjugated to sulfate or glucuronide derivatives and excreted in the urine.
Nutritional sources.
The synthesis of norepinephrine depends on the presence of tyrosine, an amino acid found in proteins such as meat, nuts, and eggs. Dairy products such as cheese also contain high amounts of tyrosine (the amino acid is named for "tyros", the Greek word for cheese). However, adult humans readily synthesize tyrosine from phenylalanine, an essential amino acid. Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine, which in turn is a precursor to epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Orientation character

In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, an "orientation character" on a group formula_1 is a group homomorphism
Motivation.
Given a manifold "M", one takes formula_3 (the fundamental group), and then formula_4 sends an element of formula_1 to formula_6 if and only if the class it represents is orientation-reversing.
This map formula_4 is trivial if and only if "M" is orientable.
The orientation character is an algebraic structure on the fundamental group of a manifold, which captures which loops are orientation reversing and which are orientation preserving.
Twisted group algebra.
The orientation character defines a twisted involution (*-ring structure) on the group ring formula_8, by formula_9 (i.e., formula_10, accordingly as formula_11 is orientation preserving or reversing). This is denoted formula_12.
Properties.
The orientation character is either trivial or has kernel an index 2 subgroup, which determines the map completely.

ALDH2

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family (mitochondrial), also known as ALDH2, is a human gene found on chromosome 12.
Function.
The enzyme encoded by this gene belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes that catalyze the chemical transformation from acetaldehyde to acetic acid. Aldehyde dehydrogenase is the second enzyme of the major oxidative pathway of alcohol metabolism.
Isoforms.
Two major liver isoforms of this enzyme, cytosolic and mitochondrial, can be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobilities, kinetic properties, and subcellular localizations. The ALDH2 gene encodes a mitochondrial isoform, which has a low Km for acetaldehydes, and is localized in mitochondrial matrix; in contrast the ALDH1 gene codes for the cytosolic isoform.
Clinical significance.
Most Europeans have two major isozymes, while approximately 50% of Northeast Asians have one normal copy of the ALDH2 gene and one mutant copy that encodes an inactive mitochondrial isoenzyme. A remarkably higher frequency of acute alcohol intoxication among Northeast Asians than among Europeans has been repeatedly shown to be related to the very much reduced activity of the mutant ALDH2-2 isoenzyme. There has been a steady increase over the past 10 years in the number of Japanese alcoholics who manage to overcome their genetically determined aversion to alcoholism from the dominant effects of an ALDH2-2 mutation. This trend demonstrates that, even among those least likely to succumb to alcoholism, there are social pressures to drink.
An activator of ALDH2 enzymatic activity, Alda-1 (N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-2,6-dichlorobenzamide), has been shown to reduce ischemia-induced cardiac damage caused by myocardial infarction.
Interactions.
ALDH2 has been shown to interact with GroEL.

In 1935 Muhs was the Secretary of State in the "Reichsministerium für Kirchenfragen". His synchronization efforts and theological incompetence caused many disputes with the churches.
Against the orders of Heinrich Himmler who wanted to draw distance between the Schutzstaffel and the Church, Muhs participated in the funeral of Archbishop Karl Joseph Schulte in an SS uniform in 1941. Muhs, who had the rank of an SS-Oberführer, was expelled from the SS. Nevertheless, after the death of Hans Kerrl, he succeeded Kerrl as Minister for Church Affairs until 1945.

Panda Bear (musician)

Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978 in Baltimore, Maryland) also known as Panda Bear, is an experimental musician and a founding member of Animal Collective, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal. His third album "Person Pitch" won best album of 2007 on many publications including Pitchfork.
Early life.
Lennox grew up in the Roland Park section of Baltimore, Maryland, and attended high school at Kimberton Waldorf School in Chester County, Pennsylvania. As a child and teenager, he played sports, mainly soccer and basketball. Lennox has also stated in interviews that he enjoyed drawing a lot as a teenager, especially pandas, and later started drawing pandas on his early mixtapes. He also studied piano until he was eight, then cello, and later on he sang tenor in his high school chamber choir.
Though he and his family have never been very religious, Lennox briefly attended Boston University where he majored in Religion because of his interest "in the concept of God". While a student at the University, Lennox starred in three student short films: "Fish Sticks" and "Fecal Matters", both directed by Andrew Drazek; and "Appy Halloween", directed by Black Nasty.
Musical career.
Animal Collective.
As a teen, Lennox began listening to electronic music styles such as house and techno and artists such as Aphex Twin, all of which became a major influence on his later work. He recorded and performed music—solo and with friends. Lennox started using the name "Panda Bear" because he drew pictures of pandas for the artwork of his recordings.
Lennox had been friends with Deakin (Josh Dibb) since the second grade. Deakin introduced Lennox to his high school friends Avey Tare (Dave Portner) and Geologist (Brian Weitz). For years, the four of them swapped homemade recordings, shared musical ideas and performed in different group configurations. Lennox, along with Deakin moved to New York in 2000. The band then became more collaborative in nature and they finally settled on the name "Animal Collective". Lennox and Avey Tare are the only members who have contributed to all of the band's releases.
Since the 2007 releases of Panda Bear's "Person Pitch" and Animal Collective's "Strawberry Jam", he has focused more on using samplers and other electronics in their shows. He has named Black Dice as a major influence stating "Black Dice took us on our first tour and I feel like the wisest things I’ve learned about being in a band I learned by watching them." and that he looks to "Black Dice" "as a model for a band. [...] I feel like as a band, I can't speak for the other guys Animal Collective, but certainly for myself, like I modelled the way I approach to everything with the band watching the way "Black Dice" did it." In addition to singing, Lennox played drums and occasionally guitar in Animal Collective's live performances. He cites Stewart Copeland as the biggest influence on his drumming style.
Solo work.
Lennox's debut album "Panda Bear" was released in 1999 on Soccer Star Records. After focusing more on touring and recording with Animal Collective, he released the follow-up "Young Prayer" in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album "Person Pitch" in 2007. Of his songwriting style, Lennox says "I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something."
Lennox's fourth album "Tomboy" was due to be released "near the end of 2010". He started performing material from "Tomboy" on December 5, 2008 at a show with No Age in Miami, FL. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's MySpace blog. Panda Bear has also played Primavera Sound Festival in 2010. The single "Tomboy" and the b-side "Slow Motion" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles "You Can Count on Me" and "Alsatian Darn" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of "You Can Count On Me" sold out in less than a day. The single "Last Night at the Jetty" was released December 2010. The single "Surfer's Hymn" was released March 28, 2011. Panda Bear's fourth album "Tomboy" was released April 12, 2011 on his own label, Paw Tracks.
His song "Comfy In Nautica" appears in ABC's 2010 global warming movie "Earth 2100"
Lennox was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012. 
June 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. The new record is titled "Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper".
Outside musical collaborations.
Lennox also plays in the band Jane and Together with DJ Scott Mou. He has also performed on tracks with Atlas Sound (Bradford Cox of Deerhunter), Ducktails (Matt Mondanile of Real Estate) and electronic musician Zomby.
Panda Bear appeared on the track "Doin' It Right" on the 2013 Daft Punk album, Random Access Memories.
Personal life.
In 2004, Lennox moved from New York to Lisbon, Portugal. He first visited the city for a vacation following a long Animal Collective tour in 2003. Lennox says about Lisbon: "Since I got off the airplane here the first time I had a good feeling about this place." It was while on vacation that he met his wife, the fashion designer Fernanda Pereira. After visiting each other in Lisbon and New York, Lennox decided to move to Europe because he also felt "connected to the European way of life", considering himself as a "slow moving kind of person" and Lisbon as a "slow moving kind of place". Lennox and Pereira are married and have a daughter, Nadja, and a son, as of June 2010. In 2007, he and Pereira collaborated on a line of sweatshirts called "2nd Things".

Hans Kundrat

Hans Kundrat (October 6, 1845 – April 25, 1893) was an Austrian pathologist born in Vienna.
He studied medicine in Vienna, and as a student he was a demonstrator under Josef Hyrtl and Karl von Rokitansky. In 1868 he received his medical doctorate, and remained in Vienna as an assistant to Rokitansky. In 1873 he obtained his habilitation, and in 1877 attained the chair of pathology at the University of Graz. Five years later he returned to the University of Vienna as chair of pathology, a position he kept until his death. One of his better known students was Richard Paltauf (1858–1924).
In 1893 he provided a comprehensive description of lymphosarcoma, and was able to differentiate it from other disease such as pseudoleukemia and some forms of Hodgkin's disease. Historically, another name for lymphosarcoma was "Kundrat's disease". In the field of gynecology, with George Julius Engelmann, he was the first to document the cyclical changes that take place in the endometrium.
He was the uncle of artist Maximilian Liebenwein, and served a key role in helping him pursue his chosen career.
