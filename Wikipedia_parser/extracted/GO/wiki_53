Tania (artist)

Tania (1920, Warsaw, Poland, Tatiana Lewin – 1982, Brooklyn, New York) was a Polish-born, New York based, Jewish American abstract painter, sculptor, collage artist, and painter of city walls. She was known by several different married names over the course of her career (including Tania Pollak, Tania Milicevic, Tania Schreiber, Tania Schreiber-Milicevic, Tania Milicevic-Mills, and Tania Mills), but decided as of 1958 to use simply her first name, Tania. She was active in the New York art world from 1949 to 1982, but is perhaps best known for her 13-story geometric wall painting of 1970, which still stands at the corner of Mercer St. & 3rd St. in Greenwich Village, New York. In 1966, she became a founding member of City Walls, Inc., a non-profit organization that commissioned abstract artists to paint walls around New York City, and which (when consolidated with the Public Arts Council in 1977) would later become the Public Art Fund.
Early life and education.
Tania was born in 1920 in Warsaw, Poland, to Mischa (Michael) and Rosalia (Rose) Lewin. Around 1931, the family emigrated to Paris, where Tania spent the rest of her childhood. The family fled to Montréal, Canada in 1941 following Germany's invasion of France. There, Tania received a Master of Arts from McGill University before relocating to New York City with her parents in 1943. She began a PhD in French Literature at Columbia University, but left the program with ABD status. In 1949, she began courses at the Art Students League of New York, where she studied painting with Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Morris Kantor, and Vaclav Vytlacil.
Career.
Over the course of her career, Tania worked in a number of styles before settling on her characteristic geometric abstract style featuring hard-edged triangles. Her early paintings from the late 1940s evidence the influence of her teacher Yasuo Kuniyoshi, both in terms of their subject matter and color palette. In her student years, she exhibited in juried student exhibitions at the Art Students' League. In 1951, she was included in a group show of newcomers at the Creative Gallery. From 1954-58, she made a living designing wallpaper, fabrics, and carpets while raising her young children. 
Tania had her first "one-man show" at Albert Landry Gallery in 1959. She asked Ad Reinhardt to help her hang the show. Through the early 1960s, she worked primarily in collage and assemblage. This phase featured abstract collages of corrugated cardboard and paint as well as more heavily Pop-influenced collages and wood assemblages featuring signage, advertising, and other found materials. She exhibited several of these colorful wood sculptures in her 1963 solo show at Bertha Schaefer Gallery under the name "Color Structures." During this time, Tania also exhibited what she called her "complementary paintings," works comprising two abutted canvases. These "complementary" (or "binary" works) typically combined collaged canvases with monochrome ones. In a related set of works on paper, she mounted collages opposite her own poetry in French. Her 1961 show at Landry Gallery included complementary paintings and corrugated board collages, but also several large-scale "environments." In 1962, she was sponsored by Ad Reinhardt, Philip Pearlstein and Pandolfini and elected as a member of the The Artists' Club. She began teaching at New York University in 1963.
Two drawings housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art show that Tania had arrived at her geometric style at least by 1967. She produced paintings and prints featuring variations on her characteristic "overlapping triangles" composition. In this period, she also produced large-scale aluminum sculptures that translated the overlapping triangles composition into multi-planar, three-dimensional form. Examples of this type of sculpture can be seen in the Kingsborough Community College Marine & Academic Center building in Brooklyn and on the library at Albright College in Reading, PA. In a statement from 1978, Tania likened her triangles to rooftops, seen from above: "For a few years now I have been thinking of my paintings (always executed on the floor) as roof tops seen from the air - in the clouds - in the sun - in the night. The paintings have become sketches for buildings planned from the top down...The Spiral Jetty of Smithson could be done in the City."
From roughly 1966, when she co-founded City Walls Inc., Tania had begun to devote much of her energy to public and outdoor art projects. With the sponsorship of City Walls, she painted walls at Evergreen & Weirfield Aves in Brooklyn (1968), Bryant & Lafayette Aves in the Bronx (1968), and at Mercer & 3rd St. in Manhattan (1970), but only the Manhattan wall remains. In 1972, she collaborated with Nassos Daphnis to produce a temporary "environment in process" by painting various surfaces at the construction site of a high-rise in Times Square—from the building's skeleton (Daphnis), to the surrounding plywood scaffolding, to construction workers' shoes and toolboxes.
Tania commented in her writings about the difficulty of being a woman artist who painted geometric abstractions. In one unpublished autobiographical text she writes, "My paintings were 'too large for a woman,' said the New York Times ...I painted like a man... I guess I was supposed to paint flowers."
Collections.
Tania's works can be found in the following public collections:
She also designed doors for a Torah ark (1966–67) that is still in use at the White Street Synagogue (or Synagogue for the Arts) in New York.

Sopwith Admiralty Type 137

The Sopwith Admiralty Types 137 and 138 were a pair of single-engine, two-seat naval biplane floatplanes, built to a British Admiralty order in 1914. They were similar in design, but having a more powerful engine the Type 138 was the larger and heavier. They were used in early torpedo dropping experiments in 1914. 
Design and development.
The Admiralty Types 137 and 138 were built by Sopwiths to a contract calling for two similarly laid out floatplanes powered by different makes of engine of markedly different powers. This requirement lead to the two aircraft having significantly different dimensions and weights. They were built in parallel and handed over to the Admiralty within a few days of each other in August 1914.
They were both biplanes, with round tipped constant chord wings connected by pairs of parallel interplane struts. The Type 137 was a standard two bay biplane but the 8 ft (2.4 m) larger span Type 138 had an additional small inner bay. There was some stagger, though less on the Type 138. The upper wing had the greater span, overhanging by 6 ft (1.8 m) on the Type 137 and by 4 ft (1.2 m) on the Type 138. This overhang was braced with an extra pair of interplane struts, leaning outwards and attached to the lower wing at the same points as the outer vertical interplane struts. There were externally interconnected ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The lower wings were attached to the bottom fuselage and the upper ones supported well above the cockpits by cabane struts.
The fuselage was a flat sided, wooden, cross braced girder structure. This carried a conventional fin and rudder, plus a rectangular tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, with split elevators. There were two cockpits in tandem, with the pilot seated aft. Both types had long, flat sided floats with curved upper and lower surfaces, the latter with a single step. These were attached to the fuselage with a fore and aft pair of inverted W-form struts, the latter leaf sprung. A similar, though smaller and unstepped third float was mounted on long struts beneath the tail, fitted with a water rudder.
The principal difference between the two types was the engine. The smaller Type 137 was designed for, and initially flown with, a 120 hp (90 kW) six-cylinder inline water-cooled Austro-Daimler, while the Type 138 had a 200 hp (150 kW) Salmson 2M7 14-cylinder water-cooled radial. Engine choice determined the shape of the nose: the inline engine had a rectangular radiator mounted in front of it, projecting slightly above the upper fuselage line, whereas the radial was uncowled, with a pair of vertical radiators mounted in the small inner bays of the Type 138.
Operational history.
Both aircraft operated in the Solent area from August 1914 until they were withdrawn from use in January 1916. The Type 138 was used in successful torpedo dropping trials in August and September 1914. The Type 137 was badly damaged in September 1914 and was later fitted with the same type of engine as in the Type 138.

In probability, statistics, economics, and actuarial science, the Benini distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is a statistical size distribution often applied to model incomes, severity of claims or losses in actuarial applications, and other economic data. It's tail behavior decays faster than a power law, but not as fast as an exponential. This distribution was introduced by Rodolfo Benini in 1905. Somewhat later than Benini's original work, the distribution has been independently discovered or discussed by a number of authors.

Tobias El Khazen

Tobias El Khazen (or Tubiya al-Khazin, , ) was the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch from 1756 to his death in 1766.
Life.
Tobias El Khazen was a member of the Abu Nawfal branch of the Khazen family, which ruled the Keserwan District, and he was a nephew of Patriarch Joseph Dergham El Khazen. He entered in the Lebanese Maronite Order and in 1730 he was consecrated titular bishop of Banyas by his uncle. In 1733, when his uncle became patriarch, Tobias was appointed administrator of the Patriarchal residence of Qannubin Monastery, in the Kadisha Valley, and titular bishop of Naplouse. In 1735 he was appointed bishop of the Maronite diocese of Cyprus, and with this title he participated in the 1736 Maronite Synod of Mount-Lebanon.
In 1743 at the death of his uncle Patriarch Joseph Dergham Khazen, after the initial refusal of Simon Awad, Tobias in competition with Elias Mohasseb tried to be elected patriarch, but the case came to the Pope who chose Simon Awad in place of the two pretenders. In 1750 Tobias was appointed bishop of Tyre and Vice-Patriarch and at the death of Simon Awad, Tobias succeeded at being elected patriarch on February 28, 1756. He was confirmed by Pope Benedict XIV on March 28, 1757.
As patriarch, Tobias had three main issues to manage: the implementation of the 1736 Maronite Synod, the Hindiyya case and the problems in the Lebanese Maronite Order. To implement the 1736 Synod he summoned a new synod on August 25, 1756 without great results, and again another synod in 1762 which reduced the dioceses only to fifteen, not eight as requested in 1736. About Hindiyya he took a neutral position, which allowed Hindiyya to grow her influence during his patriarchate. The dispute over the Lebanese Maronite Order could be solved only under his successor. Tobias El Khazen died on May 29, 1766.

St. Mary's Church (Swormville, New York)

St. Mary's Catholic Church is a church located on the corner of Transit (New York State Route 78) and Stahley roads in Swormville, New York, in the United States. Originally known as St. Mary’s Church of the Assumption at Transit, the building was constructed of about 260,000 bricks. John Nepomucene Neumann (later to be named St. John Neumann) started to visit Swormville, celebrating mass in local homes, barns and fields. In 1839 he instructed that a small house would be made to hold mass. Bishop John Timon established the first catholic church (St. Mary's) of the town of Clarence, New York. In 1861, Father Michael Schinabeak made plans for a church to be constructed. Construction began in 1862 and finished in fall of 1865. The official opening of the Church was in January 1866. In 2010 a new Church was constructed behind the old St. Mary's.

2010–11 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team

The 2010–11 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team represented Harvard University in the Ivy League athletic conference during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the Lavietes Pavilion, which has a capacity of 2,195. The team was led by fourth-year head coach Tommy Amaker. By earning a share of the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season title, the team became the first men's basketball Ivy League champion in school history. This was the 100th season for Harvard basketball.
After the annual 14-game double round robin schedule, Harvard and Princeton tied as co-champion, resulting in a one-game playoff to determine the league's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. After losing, the team earned an automatic bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, where they lost in the first round. It was the school's first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament.
The seniorless team was captained by Keith Wright and Oliver McNally. Wright, a junior, was a unanimous All-Ivy first team selection and named Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year. Sophomores Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry were named All-Ivy second team and sophomore Christian Webster was an honorable mention. The team established a new school record for single-season wins, a record for conference game wins and by going undefeated at home set a record for home wins.
Preseason.
The team was coming off a 2009–10 season during which it set a school record for wins (21), non-conference wins (11), home wins (11), and road/neutral wins (10). However, the team lost its star Jeremy Lin to the National Basketball Association. The team entered the season not having participated in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament since the 1946 Tournament. It also entered the season as the only member school not to have won at least one Ivy League men's basketball championship since the league was formed during the 1956–57 season. Of the 34 men's and women's sports in which Harvard competes, this was the only sport that they had never won a championship. They had only finished in second three times in the past and only one of those was outright.
Most preseason publications predicted Princeton would finish in first place and Harvard would finish in second place, although the "Sporting News" projected that would finish in first followed by Princeton and Harvard. Breaking a three-year streak by Cornell, the Ivy League media poll selected Princeton as the top team with twelve first place votes, Harvard second with four first place votes and Cornell third with one first place vote. It was the first Princeton team to be the preseason selection since the .
Season.
During the season, the team lost to its only ranked opponent, #4 Connecticut (December 22), but defeated power conference opponents Boston College (January 5) of the Atlantic Coast Conference and Colorado (November 28) of the Big 12 Conference. The Colorado victory was the team's first ever against a Big 12 opponent. In addition to defeating Boston College, the team defeated other cross-town rivals (December 11) and (December 31). The team also lost to Amaker's former team (as a coach), Michigan (December 4). The Harvard gameplan involved fast breaks initiated by its defensive and an inside-outside game. Although Harvard never appeared in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, for a few weeks (January 24, January 31 and February 21 and March 7) during the season they received a vote in the AP Poll.
As the season wound down, there was much ado in the press about a possible Harvard Ivy League championship. The most recent Harvard team to be in contention for a championship entering the final weekend was the 1984 team. On March 5, Harvard clinched a share of the league championship for the first time since the Ivy League was formed. By defeating Princeton at home on March 5 and earning a split of the season series, they clinched at least a share of the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season Championship with a 12–2 conference record. Princeton fell to 11–2 with one conference game remaining to force a one-game playoff for the conferences automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Harvard finished the season a perfect 14–0 at home, which surpassed the prior season's record of eleven home wins. Harvard will enter the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season with a 17-game home streak (10th longest in the country). Harvard's 12 conference game wins was also a school record. On March 7, Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. It was the first time in program history that they received votes in the Coaches' Poll.
Postseason.
On March 8, Princeton defeated Penn to force a one-game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Princeton won the playoff by a 63–62 margin. However, many thought Harvard had a chance to make the tournament in spite of the loss as an at-large team. Four of Harvard's regular season losses were to postseason contenders, and Cornell represented the conference well the year before. Entering selection Sunday (March 13), Harvard ranked 35th in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). However, Harvard was not selected. Unfortunately, neither of Harvard's quality wins (against Colorado and Boston College) helped them because both teams were left out of the NCAA tournament and relegated to number one seed status in the NIT tournament. It was the Ivy League's first NIT invitation since the 2003 when Brown participated. As a regular season champion not invited to the NCAA tournament, they were an automatic selection for the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, where they were seeded #6. On March 15, Harvard was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. The final record of 23–7 established a school record for number of wins, surpassing the prior season's total of 21. Harvard finished the season ranked 40th nationally by the "Collegiate Basketball News" RPI, CollegeRPI.com RPI and NCAA RPI. The team finished second in the nation in free throw percentage (80.8%), led by Oliver McNally who was 2nd as an individual with a 92.6% and Christian Webster who was 12th with an 89.4%. Harvard had no seniors on the team and was expected to be a contender again the following season.

Dani Dayan

Dani Dayan (); Born in 1955 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Israeli political leader, entrepreneur and advocate for the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. He served as the Chairman of the Yesha Council from 2007 - 2013. In 2013, he resigned as Chairman of the Yesha Council to endorse Benjamin Netanyahu for Prime Minister. Dayan was subsequently appointed as Chief Foreign Envoy of the Yesha Council, as the only official representative of the Israeli settlement movement to the international community.
Described by the New York Times as “worldly and pragmatic” and "the most effective leader the settlers have had." Dayan is perceived by many to be the face of the Israeli settlement movement to the international community. His writing appears in many publications, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, USA Today, The Guardian, Haaretz, The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post.
Early life.
Dayan and his family emigrated to Israel in 1971, when he was 15, settling in the Tel Aviv neighborhood of Yad Eliyahu.
He holds a B.Sc in Economics and Computer Science from Bar Ilan University and an M.Sc in Finance from the Tel Aviv University. He is a Major (Res.) in the IDF.
In 1982, Dayan established an information technology firm "Elad Systems", which he headed, first as CEO and later as Chairman, until 2005, when he sold his interests in the company. He continues to invest in high-tech companies and serves as a lecturer at Ariel University.
Dayan was the Secretary-General of the Tehiya political party and was a candidate to the Knesset on its list in the Israeli legislative elections in 1988 and 1992.
Early Political Life.
In 2004, he sold his software company and entered into settlement politics.
In 2009 he was offered a spot on The Jewish Home's list, but declined.
He was a member on the Executive Committee of the Yesha Council for 8 years, before being elected as Chairman on July 13, 2007.
As Chairman he led the Settlers' struggle against the Settlement freeze in 2010.
Dayan was elected chairman of the Yesha Council in July 2007. The Yesha Council is a political lobby for the Israeli settler movement. The organization's mandate is to provide support to Israeli settlements in ways such as helping them acquire bulletproof ambulances and buses, and lobbying the government to provide basic utilities to settlements.
Following his election, Dayan began transforming the council into an effective political lobby, modeled on American political lobbies.
Despite being a key figure in the largely religious settlement movement, Dayan is secular. He opposes a two-state solution, and believes that holding onto the West Bank is in Israel's best interest. He currently lives in the West Bank settlement of Ma'ale Shomron.
He is a cousin of TV celebrity Ilana Dayan.

<doc id="31094039" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31094039" title="Kenyan general election, 2013">
Kenyan general election, 2013

General elections were held in Kenya on 4 March 2013, electing the President, Senators, County Governors, Members of Parliament for the 290 electoral constituencies, Civic Wards and Women County Representatives. They were the first elections held under the new constitution, which was passed during the 2010 referendum. They were the first general elections run by Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
Dates.
Election date.
Originally the dates of 14 August 2012 or December 2012 were planned for the election, depending on a court ruling to be issued. The court ruled that presidential and parliamentary elections should be held in March 2013.
The setting of this date also resulted in the resignation in September 2012 of several civil servants who wished to join politics as required by the elections Act
Election schedule.
On 28 December 2012, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission announced the Notice of General Elections which confirmed the following:
General dates.
The IEBC also indicate that disputes relating to or arising from nominations will be determined within seven days of the lodging of the dispute with the Commission.
Dates for submission of nomination papers.
The allowed time for the submission is to be between eight o’clock in the morning and one o’clock in the afternoon and between the hours of two o’clock and four o’clock in the afternoon.
Legislation and rules.
IEBC.
The IEBC in its Notice of General Election Cited the following Legislation as key to governing the process:
Supreme Court.
On 13 January, the Judiciary indicated it would hear and determine within two weeks disputes on Presidential Election results. The Judiciary Working Committee on Election Preparations (JWCEP) announced that election petitions would be certified urgent. These rules were developed in pursuance of Article 163(8) of the constitution which mandates the Supreme Court to make rules for the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction of hearing presidential election petition.
Voter registration.
Voter registration ran from 19 November 2012 for 30 days. Problems were reported during the first few days of the registration exercise included availability of electricity, military operations in some areas and logistical challenges caused by rains. Another subsequent challenge was the inability to register prospective voters who were still awaiting issuance of their formal identity documents by the government.
Diaspora voters.
On 27 November, the government announced that due to time and logistics constraints there would be no attempts to register Kenyan voters in the diaspora. The IEBC later announced a decision to register Kenyan diaspora voters living within the East African Community Countries.
The ten-day exercise concluded on 25 December 2012 with low turnout attributed to “logistical challenges”. The IEBC estimate was that about 1,700 people registered.
BVR kits.
Voter registration was carried out using Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) Kits which would reduce certain incidents of fraud. The purchase of the BVR Kits was financed through a loan from Standard Chartered Kenya in a government-to-government deal involving Kenya and Canada made cheaper by a guarantee from the Canadian government. The Canadian government arranged to have its fully owned parastatal, Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), sign a contract with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
Registration deadline.
A case was filed in court seeking to extend the voter registration period arguing that Section 5(1) of the Elections Act was in conflict with the Constitution to the extent that it limited continuous registration of voters. The courts however declined request to extend the deadline
Registered voter numbers.
After the 18 December deadline, the IEBC released the provisional voter numbers showing a registered base of 14.3 million voters. The IEBC indicated that they had missed their target of 18 million voters citing voter apathy as one of reasons for this. The IEBC begun an exercise to cleaning up the voters’ roll with a target of opening it for verification early January 2013.
Register verification.
On 13 January 2013 IEBC opened its voter register for inspection. Voters were to verify their details before 26 January to enable the commission clean the register ahead of the poll. The options include visiting respective registration centers, the IEBC website or the use of mobile phone numbers via an SMS service (using National Identity Card or Passport numbers used during registration).
The IEBC announced on 23 February 2013 that it had has removed 20,000 voters who had registered more than once from the voter roll. The names were identified during continuing activities to clean up the register.
Political party activities.
Coalitions and alliances.
The law required all Kenyan political parties to register any coalition agreements with the Registrar of Political Parties by 4 December 2012. This resulted in several publicized discussions among key political players and their respective parties who aimed to form pre-election coalitions prior to the deadline. Another likely effect of the agreements was a reduction in the number of prospective candidates.
Four coalitions formed by the deadline include:
Nominations.
Dates.
The release of the calendar resulted in several parties opting to hold their nominations on 17 January 2013. The IEBC proposed public school shut down on 17 January 2013, as the schools would be the venue for a significant number of nomination activities across the country. The Government confirmed that public schools would not open on 17 January 2013.
The government would later announce that Public primary schools would for the second day (18 January 2013) remain closed to allow party primaries to continue.
On 19 January the IEBC indicated that political aspirants who lost during respective party primaries are not allowed to defect and seek tickets on other parties after Midnight on 18 January 2013. By law, political parties were expected to nominate their candidates for an election at least 45 days before.
Chaos.
While other parties and coalitions held their nominations early, the Jubilee, Amani and CORD coalitions chose to hold country wide their nominations 2 days before the deadline. These were marked with disorganization and chaos with protests arising in Nairobi, Nyanza and Central provinces.
IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee.
Further acrimony arose over issuance of certificates by political parties,with over 200 complaints filed with the IEBC disputes and Resolution panel
The committee consisted of 4 IEBC Commissioners and one official from the Director of Public Prosecutions office. The members were:
The committee held its sittings at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. Complaints raised included issuing of certificates not losers, nepotism and discrimination. The committee had seven days to complete the arbitration process with those dissatisfied with the tribunal's decision asked to lodge their cases with the High Court. The panel eventually announced 3 days of hearings.
The Panel completed its work on 28 January 2013 dismissing 64 out of 207 petitions following failure by complainants to attend. 29 applications did not need determination as Political parties conceded to the complaints.
Violence and unrest.
In mid-August 2012, tribal conflict led to the highest death toll through deliberate killings since the last election. Though the specific instance had no clear motive, past clashes have occurred due to the alleged misuse of land and water resources, however this instance was reportedly larger in scale and intensity. Speculation was made of links to the election amid an increase in political tensions.
During and in the aftermath of the political party nominations held between 17 and 18 January 2013 unrest was seen in several parts of the country most notably in Nairobi, Nyanza and Central Provinces
The 2013 election was largely peaceful other than an incident in the early hours of 4 Mar just before polls opened where a gang killed at least six police officers in the region of Changamwe, Mombasa. and in Kwale county. The authorities immediately blamed the Mombasa Republican Council (a fringe separatist group that had opposed the elections and believes that Kenya’s coastal zone should be a separate country) and arrested some of its members over the incident. Nevertheless, turnout in the affected counties was still high.
Cost.
The election was expected to cost significantly more than previous elections with estimates of Ksh 24 Billion compared to the Ksh 8 Billion spent on the 2007 election by the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK).
Elections.
On 18 July 2013 released final result of all election
Also Included was registered Voters
President.
Due to the terms of the new constitution, it could also be the first presidential election in Kenya where presidential candidates face a second round run-off between the first and the second if no-one achieves an absolute majority of more than half the votes cast in the first round as well as 25% of the votes in at least 24 counties.
The first round of the presidential election took place on March 4, 2013. Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the president-elect of Kenya by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Raila Odinga challenged this in the Supreme Court of Kenya.His petition challenging the results was dismissed on March 30, 2013.
The results of the Presidential election were as follows:
Senate.
The senate elections, also the first in the country's history under the new constitution will be held for all 47 counties on 4 March 2013
The race produced 244 candidates.

Grant Hildebrand

Grant Hildebrand is an American architect and architectural historian who is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Architecture in the College of Built Environments at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Hildebrand earned his Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Michigan in 1957 and subsequently worked for the offices of Albert Kahn and Minoru Yamasaki. After completing his Master of Architecture at the University of Michigan in 1964, he joined the faculty of the Department of Architecture at the University of Washington, where he taught until the year 2000. At Washington, Hildebrand taught architectural design, architectural history, and a variety of other classes. He received the University's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1975. In 1978 he became interested in the work of the English geographer Jay Appleton, who developed a theory about the innate appeal of certain landscapes. Hildebrand applied these ideas to architectural space, teaching a course on this topic beginning in 1988.
Hildebrand's early research and writing drew on his time with the firm of Albert Kahn, leading to "Designing for Industry: The Architecture of Albert Kahn" (1974). Hildebrand's interest in the work of Jay Appleton is reflected in two books, "The Wright Space: Pattern and Meaning in Frank Lloyd Wright's Houses" (1991) and "Origins of Architectural Pleasure" (1999) which received the Washington Governor's Writers' Award. Hildebrand's recent publications have focused on architecture and design by his friends and colleagues, including books on the houses of Wendell Lovett and Arne Bystrom, projects by Phillip Jacobson, and architecture by Gene Zema and by George Suyama.

Hamilton Wildcats (Canadian football)

The Hamilton Wildcats were a Canadian football team based in Hamilton, Ontario that played in the Ontario Rugby Football Union from 1941 to 1947, and in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union from 1948 to 1949. The team was formed to play in the ORFU in 1941 to fill the void left by the Hamilton Tigers, who ceased operations that year due to a large number of players joining the army. In 1943 and 1944, the team assumed the name Hamilton Flying Wildcats to reflect the Royal Canadian Air Force personnel on the team. After struggling to compete on a sound financial level with the Hamilton Tigers, who resumed operations following World War II, the two clubs merged in 1950 to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.
History.
Ontario Rugby Football Union.
For many years, Hamilton had an unstable presence in the ORFU, with various teams folding and being renamed. In 1941, the city's IRFU team, the Hamilton Tigers, folded due to a large number of players leaving to fight in World War II. As such, this left a void in Hamilton's football, which would be filled that year by an ORFU team named the Hamilton Wildcats. The Wildcats were granted permission to use the Tigers' players, but not their colours, so they adopted the colours of red and white.
Between 1942 and 1944, the IRFU suspended operations due to the war, leaving many talented players to join teams in the ORFU. This led the Wildcats to a very successful three years in which they posted a 19-6-1 record with two appearances in the Grey Cup championship game with one win coming in 1943. In the 1943 and 1944 seasons, the team is officially recognized as the Hamilton Flying Wildcats due to the RCAF personnel playing on the team. Consequently, the team that won the 31st Grey Cup is recorded as the Hamilton Flying Wildcats. 
After the war ended, the IRFU resumed operations and players that had played for the Tigers were returned to their club. The Wildcats dropped the "flying" from their nickname since the RCAF personnel no longer played for them. After a difficult season in 1945, which saw the club miss the playoffs, the Wildcats claimed back-to-back regular season first place finishes in 1946 and 1947, but lost in the ORFU finals both years. 
Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and merger.
Due to monetary disputes that the Hamilton Tigers were having with the IRFU, the Tigers transferred to the ORFU, with the Wildcats switching to the IRFU on April 9, 1948. The switch proved to be difficult for the team, who went from first in the ORFU to dead last in the IRFU, with only one win in their two seasons in that league. Both teams were struggling to compete for fan support and the financial repercussions started to mount. As a result, local prominent citizens including Mr. Ralph W. Cooper, Mr. F.M. Gibson, Mr. C.C. Lawson and Mr. Sam Manson decided that the two clubs should amalgamate and operate as one entity. As such, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats football club began play in 1950 in the IRFU as the singular representative of the city of Hamilton.

Emile Benoit (writer)

Emile Benoit (born 1965) is the pseudonym for the American author of the critically acclaimed "Essays and Aphorisms on the Higher Man" as well as the full length play "A Midsummer Night's Hangover". He holds both B.A. and M.A. degrees in philosophy from San Diego State University. He currently teaches in San Diego where he lives with his wife and two daughters.
Works.
Essays and Aphorisms on the Higher Man.
History has shown examples of man trying to pull himself out of his ignorant bliss and stagnancy, from the philosopher kings and Renaissance man to Nietzsche's Superman. A scant number of individuals have dared to become something more by the unremitting quest for knowledge gained from the arts, religion, philosophy, etc., and the implementation of this knowledge across the broad spectrum of their lives and the lives of others…can go beyond Kant, Hume, Nietzsche's Superman, and the selfishness of Sartre's existential humanism. In a sense, he or she can become a "higher man." Benoit writes, "The evolution of the species will be when man can incorporate and digest all of his religions and live wholly, honestly and peacefully with himself and others…when he accepts all the religions, arts, and sciences as expressions of human greatness; a time when even the truth will no longer be an eternal proposition but simply an expression of mankind’s prominence at making the incomprehensible understood – if but only briefly." As Benoit writes in the preface of the book, his intention is "to inspire, rather than impose, to incite rather than allow man to settle into a comfortable repose, delighted with himself."
The book has won critical acclaim from reviewers In a review from ForeWord (magazine), Lee Gordon writes: "With the brevity of Confucius, the beauty, depth, wit and wisdom of the poet Rumi, and his own succinct, lyrical language, Benoit writes about the human condition."
A Midsummer Night’s Hangover and Heaven.
In A Midsummer Night's Hangover, two young lovers must overcome the religious rigidity of the girl's father in order to be together. Inevitably, they must escape to the woods, fake their own deaths, and summon the devil himself for assistance. Midsummer is a darkly lyrical and comic world inhabited by lonely dreamers, vengeful lovers, rabid feminists, assorted potions, and a statue that springs to life. As a complement to the full length play, Heaven is a comedic one act that imagines a crisis in heaven wherein God Himself is suffering from a creative block and must assemble the great artists of Hell to join Him in Heaven for inspiration. What ensues is a gentle and quirky satire on religion, love, and friendship.

Patrick Mayer (German footballer)

Patrick Mayer (born 28 March 1988 in Wangen im Allgäu) is a German footballer who plays as a striker for 1. FC Heidenheim.
Career.
Mayer began his career with VfB Stuttgart, and broke into the reserve team late in the 2006–07 season, making his debut as a substitute for Danny Galm in a 1–1 draw with Karlsruher SC II. He played three more games before the end of the season, scoring twice, but after eleven games without scoring in the first half of the 2007–08 season, he signed for SSV Reutlingen on loan in January 2008. He scored four goals in thirteen matches before leaving Stuttgart permanently at the end of the season to sign for Eintracht Frankfurt II.
He only played in half of the games during the 2008–09 season, but managed ten goals, finishing as joint top scorer with Richard Weil as the team finished third in the Regionalliga Süd. At the end of the season both players joined 1. FC Heidenheim, who had just been promoted with the 3. Liga. Mayer made his debut as a substitute for Bastian Heidenfelder in a 2–0 defeat to SV Wehen Wiesbaden, and ended the season with eleven goals. He scored nineteen the following season, which made him the division's joint top scorer, alongside Eintracht Braunschweig's Dominick Kumbela, and earned him a move to FC Augsburg, who had just been promoted to the Bundesliga.
Mayer had a frustrating first half-season with Augsburg, however, making his one appearance, when he replaced Daniel Baier in a 2–1 defeat to his old club VfB Stuttgart. In January 2012, he returned to Heidenheim on loan, and at the end of the season his return to the club was made permanent. His second spell with the club has so far been marred by injury, restricting him to just fourteen appearances in the first eighteen months. He returned to semi-regular action for the 2013–14 season, as Heidenheim won the 3. Liga title.

Platymeris laevicollis

Platymeris laevicollis is a venomous predatory true bug from central Africa that can be found in forests, scrublands, grasslands, and croplands. They are efficient predators and are used by farmers on coconut plantations to control herbivorous pests such as the rhinoceros beetle. As a true bug of the order Hemiptera, it has needle-like mouth parts designed for sucking juices out of plants or other insects instead of chewing. " P. laevicollis" has sharp stylets in its proboscis or rostrum used to pierce the exoskeleton of its prey. Saliva is then injected into the prey which liquifies its tissues,and the rostrum is then used to suck out the digested fluids. If disturbed, it is capable of a defensive bite considered to be more painful than a bee sting. 
The insect is also known as the red-eyed assassin bug.

Müsahiplik

Musahiplik or "Müsahiplik" (roughly, "Companionship / Spiritual brotherhood") is a covenant relationship between two men of the same age, preferably along with their wives. In a ceremony in the presence of a dede the partners make a lifelong commitment to care for the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of each other and their children. The ties between couples who have made this commitment is at least as strong as it is for blood relatives, so much so that müsahiplik is often called spiritual brotherhood "(manevi kardeşlik)." The children of covenanted couples may not marry.
Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi reports that the identify "musahiplik" with the first gate "(şeriat)," since they regard it as a precondition for the second "(tarikat)." Those who attain to the third gate "(marifat", "gnosis") must have been in a "musahiplik" relationship for at least twelve years. Entry into the third gate dissolves the "musahiplik" relationship (which otherwise persists unto death), in a ceremony called "Öz Verme Ayini" ("ceremony of giving up the self").
The value corresponding to the second gate (and necessary to enter the third) is "aşinalik" ("intimacy," perhaps with God). Its counterpart for the third gate is called "peşinelik"; for the fourth gate "(hakikat", Ultimate Truth), "cingildaşlik" or "cegildaşlik" (translations uncertain).

Symington, South Ayrshire

Symington is a conservation village in South Ayrshire, Scotland. It is located in Symington Parish, covering 0.41sq Km, and lies close to the A77 road from Ayr to Glasgow. Its church, built in 1160, remains one of the finest examples of a Norman churches in Scotland.
Meaning of place-name.
The name of the village and parish of Symington is derived from the person of a Norman Knight, Symon Loccard or Lockhart, who held the barony of Symington lands under Walter fitz Alan, the first Steward in 1165. The Lockharts of Barr in Galston were a branch of this family. Two other villages in Scotland are named for Simon Lockhart, Symington, South Lanarkshire, and Symington in the Scottish Borders. Stevenston in Ayrshire is named for Steven Loccard or Lockart.
Facilities.
Symington has a primary school, church, a restaurant, War Memorial, an abandoned water tower and a library. The parish covers 3,736 acres and is mainly a farming community.
Buildings.
The Wheatsheaf Inn (NS 38417 31331) is an 18th-century vernacular building that has been a hostelry since its earliest days; in the days of stage coaches the inn was a posting stage on the route to Ayr.
Dating from 1937 this substantial mock-Tudor building was previously a hotel and replaced an inn that was burnt down in 1935.
This Arts & Crafts style house was built in 1931-4 by Noad & Wallace. It is embellished with gargoyles, inscriptions, and other ornamental additions. Broadmeadows is the focus of the residential centre known as Hansel Village.
Symington's churches.
The Parish Church was founded in the 12th Century by Simon Loccard and is the oldest functioning church in Ayrshire. It belonged to the Trinitarian Monastery at Fail (just outside Tarbolton). The Church was restored in the 18th Century and again in 1919. This restoration by P. MacGregor Chalmers revealed that the earlier alterations of 1797 had covered up some fine architectural features, including the 13th century windows and the open-work timber roof. Three windows with semi-circular heads are located in the gable, with heavy hoodmoulds and dog-tooth ornamentation, the finest of their style in Scotland. The base slab of an aumbrey incorporating a piscina sits as the sill of a south-facing window. The church received an addition and alterations in 1797, which increased the accommodation of the building, but detracted considerably from the unspoilt appearance. A belfry, possibly incorporating some medieval
work, was erected on the east gable end in the 17th century. Notable stained glass windows are on display, by Gordon Webster, Douglas Strachan, and others. The patronage of the church passed through several hands and was at length acquired by the Earl of Eglinton. The old manse in Kerrix Road is now known as Symington House (NS 38350 31325).
The Free Church.
The Great Disruption of 1843 resulted in a second church being established, at the junction of Main Street and Symington Road, however this has now been demolished. the minister of the parish, George Orr and his congregation, "came out" and for or a time they worshiped in a vacant public house, adapted for the purpose; the minister himself having to live in a rented room in a nearby farm house. The new church and schoolhouse were built in February 1844.
Country houses.
The country seats were Coodham, with its well wooded grounds, sizeable ornamental lake, and once splendid gardens, one mile north-east ; Dankeith, one mile north ; Townend, half-a-mile west ; and Rosemount, one mile and a-half south-west.
In 1826 Mrs William Fairlie, widow of a banker from Calcutta built the mansion house and in total expended £20,000 on various improvements. In the 1870s W. H. Houldsworth Esq owned the property and added a new wing, conservatory and a private chapel. It was known as Williamfield for a time and later the property was renamed 'Fatima House' and became a retreat with a new wing added. Latterly the house was vacated and became ruinous. Coodham is the official name again and nowadays the site of a luxurious development: the category A listed building has been fully restored after a period of dereliction.
In 1850 James Ogilvie Fairlie of Coodham organised a meeting at the Red Lion in Prestwick of fifty-seven gentlemen from the West of Scotland, leading to the formation of the Prestwick Golf Club and as a direct result in 1860 the first Open Championship was held.
First recorded as Dalketh or Freris Dalkeithe this property was given to the Black Friars of Ayr and held by them until the Reformation. Alane of Lawdor had given the lands in memory of his wife. The Cunninghames obtained the lands in 1614 and they held the property until the 1690s, when William Kelso acquired it. In 1839 Lieutenant-Colonel William Kelso was the owner of Dankeith. The Factor's house of the Dankeith Estate was Craigowan House in Brewlands Road. Dankeith House itself was built in 1893, incorporating an earlier building. The estate had a fine range of hothouses. In May 1857 Dankeith was rented by Janet Story, wife of Dr Story. She published her "Early Reminiscences" in which she comments on her servants, in particular she refers to the daughter of a local gamekeeper in glowing terms "she is perfectly lovely; just seventeen, tall with the figure of a nymph, quantities of golden hair, a skin like milk and eyes like the pearls of a forget-me-not. I never saw anyone more exquisite .." 
John Kelso Hunter (1802–1873) was born at Gillhead Cottage, close to Symington cemetery, on the Dankeith Estate and was at first employed here during his indenture as a herd boy, his father being a gardener. John moved to the village of Dundonald and became a respected artist, noted for portraiture. In 1847 he exhibited at the Royal Academy in London before becoming a regular exhibitor at the Royal Scottish Academy for the next 25 years. Hunter published two books: ‘Retrospective of an Artist’s Life’ (1868), and ‘Life Studies of Character’. He is buried in the Southern Necropolis in Glasgow.
In 1932 Dankeith was fire damaged, but restored. In WW2 it was used by the RAF and secret planning meetings for D-day and other allied operations took place here. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Passionist Fathers acquired the property as a retreat, however they sold the property circa 1968 and the site is now a leisure centre, with caravans surrounding the house.
Hugh Glover held the lands of Townend circa 1701-4 and in 1733 William Kelso of Dankeith sold the lands to George Boyd of East Overloan Farm. William Hay Boyd, Esq. of Her Majesty's 20th Regiment of Infantry in the Crimea and was the owner of Townend House (NS 37652 31552) and estate in 1839. Townend is an 18th-century building with a Victorian Italianate wing. A dated lintel in the walled garden may have come from an earlier building on the site; the old stables, were converted into a small dwelling in the 1960s. In recent times Townend Cottage has functioned as a nursing home, Townend Cottage, circa 1810, situated in the village was its former dower house. The Hay-Boyds gave land for the village hall, a school, and a garden next to the church.
Dr. Fullerton of Rosemount returned from India, circa 1770 and rebuilt the mansion-house at Rosemount, previously known as Goldring, improved the cultivation of the land, and ornamented the grounds with the belts of plantings that are apparent today (2011).
Ordnance Gazetteer entry.
In 1882-4, Francis Groome's "Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland" described Symington thus:
"Symington, a village and a parish in the NW of Kyle district, Ayrshire. The village stands 3½ miles NNE of Monkton station, and 6 SSW of Kilmarnock, under which it has a post office."
"The parish is bounded NE by Riccarton, E by Craigie, S and SW by Monkton, and W and NW by Dundonald. Its utmost length, from NNE to SSW, is 43/8 miles; its breadth varies between 1 and 2¼ miles; and its area is 3736½ acres, of which 11½ are water. In the extreme S the surface declines to close on 100 feet above sea-level; and thence it rises gently to a maximum altitude of 333 feet at a point 21/3 furlongs NNE of the church, from which it sinks again to 201 feet near the Riccarton border. It thus exhibits a pleasing diversity of swells and slopes, and contains many vantage-grounds commanding extensive views of great part of Ayrshire, the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Arran. Trap rock has been quarried for road metal, and sandstone for building; whilst limestone and coal exist, but not under profitable conditions. The soil, in general, is of a clayey character., on a hard subsoil. Nearly all the land, except about 300 acres under wood, is regularly or occasionally in tillage. The principal residences are Coodham, Dankeith, Rosemount, and Townend; and 5 proprietors hold each an annual value of £500 and upwards, 5 of between £100 and £500. Symington is in the presbytery of Ayr and the synod of Glasgow and Ayr; the living is worth £350. The parish church is an old building with Norman features, and, as entirely remodelled in 1880, contains 359 sittings. There is also a Free church; and the public school, with accommodation for 132 children, had (1884) an average attendance of 85, and a grant of £69, 16s. Valuation (1860) £6560, (1885) £7104, 5s. 3d. Pop. (1801) 668, (1841) 918, (1861) 855, (1871) 792, (1881) 697.—Ord. Sur., shs. 22, 14, 1865-63."
Archaeology.
A Law or Moot Hill once stood at the foot of the village and upon its removal some iron arrow-heads and horn combs were found. Helenton Moot Hill may have been a fortified site at one time and the Helenton Loch with its associated mill were nearby.
The Slough of Despond.
On the boundary of Dundonald and Symington parishes lies an area known as the 'Slough of Despond'. The original Slough of Despond is a deep bog in John Bunyan's allegory The Pilgrim's Progress into which the character Christian sinks under the weight of his sins and his sense of guilt for them.
The burn in this area, rising near the old Broadhirst Farm, has long been known as the Slough, the Scots equivalent spelling is Sleugh, meaning a marsh or quagmire. It is not known how the name 'Slough of Despond' was added to the area, however it is recorded since the mid 19th century and may be linked to the nearby limekilns that were generally notorious for the acrid 'hell-like' smoke that issued from them.
The Slough Burn still rises from the marshy area below the Broadhirst Woods, however the limestone quarry that served the limekilns is now abandoned, surviving as an area rich in wildlife, containing old woodland indicator plants such as Wood Anemone (Anemone nemorosa), Bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), Wood Sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), Dog's Mercury (Mercurialis perennis), Herb Robert (Geranium robertianum) and other species. The Slough Burn runs down past Dankeith House, Templeton and Fortacres, Todrigs and Caprington, to join the River Irvine near Gatehead.
Micro-history.
Freestone and whinstone are the underlying rocks and the church itself stands on an elevated outcrop.
The parish covered 3725 acres and had a population of 697 in 1881.

<doc id="31094228" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31094228" title="Mosque and Khanqah of Shaykhu">
Mosque and Khanqah of Shaykhu

The Mosque of Grand Emir Sayf al-Din Shaykhu al-Nasiri was built in 750, or 1349 C.E. and the Khanqah was built six years later in 756 or 1355 C.E. Shaykhu was the Grand Amir under the rule of Sultan Hasan.
Life of Shaykhu.
Sayf al-Din Shaykhu al-Nasiri was the major political authority and one of the most celebrated amirs in the state of Sultan Hasan. The supervision of the state was in his control and he focused on policies leading to the stability of the nation and peace between the different groups of people living in the region. He enjoyed prestige and acquired an enormous fortune through his daily income of 200,000 dirhmans or 10,000 dinars.
He was assassinated in 1357 C.E. Bey, the amir Manjak vizier, one of the Sultan’s Mamluks attacked him with a sword while Shaykhu was sitting at the House of Justice. The people in the Cairo Citadel panicked, causing so much turmoil throughout the crowd that people were killed. Bey was seized in the Mausoleum of al-Nasir, outside of Cairo, by ten of the grand amirs in full armor. Bey confessed and took full responsibility. “He said: ‘I brought to Shaykhu a request for a transfer from salary to landed property, but he did not gratify my concern. That decision had an overpowering influence on my soul’” (Smith). He was imprisoned before his execution by being impaled and afterwards his corpse circulated through the streets. Shaykhu was not killed instantly by the attacked but never recovered and died on the night of Friday, the 16th day of Dhu al-Qa’da in 758 or 1357 C.E. He is buried in his own khanqah and supplied the funds so that the Qur’an would be perpetually read at his tomb.
The Mosque.
Al-Maqrizi called this “mosque is one of the most sublime mosques in Egypt (smith).” It is located opposite the Khanqah. The foundation is said to have been built for Shaykh Akmal al-Din al-Rumi, who was the principal of twenty Sufis attached to it and was ultimately buried within the khanqah. The mosque has an unusual layout and instead of increasing wall thickness to maintain internal symmetry, as was the standard practice, the prayer hall has an irregular shape with walls that are not parallel. The walls shadow the layout of the surrounding streets and “this unconventional layout allows the mausoleum to communicate with the sanctuary through a window” (Cairo of the Mamluks) This window replaced the mausoleum’s mihrab. The courtyard of the mosque is the earliest extant in a riwaq mosque to be paved with polychrome marble. Most of the mosque’s original work has gone under restortation, however, the mihrab contains remains of the polychrome marble of the era. The lower segment of the mihrab displays eighteenth century Tunisian tiles. Maqrizi also made the claim that “no previous mosque and khanqah, in the area of Saliba, has thrived to this extent, nor was there ever created in the Bahri Mamluk state the equal to their pious endowments and the excellence of their incomes” (Smith).
The Khanqah.
The Khanqah is located in the area of al-Saliba, outside Cairo proper. It is directly opposite the Mosque of Shaykhu, which it is associated with. It was built in 756 or 1355 C.E., six years after the Mosque by Shaykhu with the intention that it would serve as both a madrasa, a school, and a khanqah, a Sufi monastery. It is the earliest known khanqah-madrasa of the Mamluk period. It had the capability to house residences of the general populace. In addition to the khanqah, there were also two baths and a row of stores with small residences in the second story above the shops constructed by Shaykhu. He arranged lectures of each of the four legal schools (Shafi‘i, Hanafi, Maliki, and Hanbali), a lecture on the hadith of the prophet, and a lecture on the seven readings of the Qur’an. He assigned a teacher and a group of students to each lecture. Shaykhu “appointed as teacher of the Shafi‘i legal scholars Baha’ al-Din Ahmed ibn ‘Ali al-Subki; for the Maliki legal scholars, the Shaykh Khalil, who had a military manner and ran the study group like his own fief; for the Hanbali legal scholars, the chief judge Muwaqqif al-Din al-Hanbali. He installed our Shaykh Akmal al-Din Muhammad ibn Mahmoud as head of the khanqah and teacher of the Hanafis. He also organized and financed food for the students and a monthly allotment of basic necessities. The reputation of the khanqah grew across the region and many notable persons of learning from the era graduated from there. It had the prestige of increasing its prosperity beyond every pious endowment in Egypt. This surplus ultimately led to the khanqah’s downfall, as the Sultan al-Nasir Faraj confiscated the money. The condition of the khanqah, once meticulously kept, declined until falling behind in payments promised to the holders of various positions needed to support the khanqah.
The building itself took seven months to complete. A faddan of land is 4200sqm and Shaykhu acquired a little more than that for the khanqah and surrounding baths and shops. The foundation inscription in the entrance portal mentions the founder’s name with the humble sufi attribute ‘al-‘abd al-faqir’ which translated means ‘the poor slave.’ The inscription on the khanqah’s minaret differs from the mosque, as the khanqah includes the Qur’an passage XXII, 27 referring to the Hajj under the title “The Pilgrimage:”
“Proclaim the Pilgrimage to all people. They will come to you on foot and on every kind of swift mount, emerging from every deep mountain pass” (Qur'an). 
Presumably, the khanqah was used to host foreign travelers passing through Cairo on their way to Mecca.
The khanqah is constructed around a courtyard, with an arcaded prayer hall on one side and living units occupying three floors on the other three sides. Instead of increasing the thickness of the wall to even out the irregular shape of the building, the prayer hall is extended past the courtyard along the street, which is similar to the style of the mosque, creating an additional space in the eastern corner, covered by a wooden dome. This is the tomb of Akmal al-Din, who died during the reign of Sultan Barquq in 786 or 1384 C.E. The Sultan revered Akmal al-Din that he ordered his burial within the khanqah, not a common occurrence for a shaykh, but Akmal al-Din was the supervisor of the endowment and even Shaykhu might have stipulated the location of his burial. Shaykhu himself is reportedly buried within the khanqah, indicating that he changed his mind after the completion of the mausoleum attached to his mosque. This modification would be coherent with his self-view as a Sufi, as expressed in the foundation inscription of the Sufi monastery he built.
The Mosque and the Khanqah.
“Although the khanqah and the mosque of Shaykhu are separated by six years, they have similar facades, portals, and minarets. The two buildings face each other across Sharia Saliba with almost identical exterior aspects, yet the interiors serve completely different purposes. By flanking - and thus framing - the street, the two opposing minarets and portals produce the effect of a monumental gate rendering the segment of the processional al-Saliba Street, defined by these two parallel facades, part of the complex of Shaykhu” (Archnet).

Wet Ink/CAL Short Story Prize

The Wet Ink/CAL Short Story Prize, formally known as the Wet Ink Short Story Prize, is an annual literary award given by the magazine "Wet Ink" for Australian short fiction. Only Australians are eligible for the award. The Wet Ink Short Story Prize was first awarded in 2011 for works written during 2010.
History.
In March 2010 the Australian magazine "Wet Ink" announced the creation of the Wet Ink Short Story Prize to mark their five years of publication.

Wet Ink closed in late 2012. Despite this, the Short Story Prize for 2012 was published online at www.wetink.com.au in April 2013, and prizes were awarded and paid. The Wet Ink website was maintained until June 2013 with details of the winners and the shortlist. The winner of the overall Wet Ink CAL prize was Claire Aman with two runners-up, Rebekah Clarkson and James Halford.

Sierra Nevada World Music Festival

The Sierra Nevada World Music Festival is an annual music festival held every June on the weekend of (or the weekend following) the summer solstice. It is currently held at the Mendocino County Fairgrounds in Boonville, California.
The festival began in 1994 in Marysville, California by organizer Warren Smith. Citing problems with crime in its initial location, organizers moved the festival to Angels Camp, California in 2001. After five years in Calaveras County, fairgrounds management insisted on hiring its own security and billing the festival. Organizers refused, causing the county to void the contract between the two parties. The festival settled in its current location (Boonville, CA), where it has operated since 2006.
Despite the festival's name, its primary focus is on reggae music, along with a secondary focus on world music acts. The festival boasts a "valley stage" (main stage), "village stage" (secondary stage), dancehall and drum circle, which can all feature music running concurrently. 
Along with its many other veteran acts, the SNWMF is notable for being the first to bring Junior Byles abroad, whereupon he performed a 45-minute set in for the festival in 1998.

Belgian immigrants in Wisconsin during the Civil War

Belgian immigrants moved to Wisconsin during the American Civil War.
Introduction.
Northeast Wisconsin saw a huge influx of immigrants from Belgium in the mid-1800s. It began in 1852 when two Belgian families decided to make the move to America. They were unhappy with the Belgian monarchy, and sought what is now known as the "American dream." Belgians then flooded Brown, Door, and Kewaunee counties. They settled in communities named after cities in the Old Country, such as Brussels, Namur, and Rosiere. To this day those three counties still hold a significant amount of people with Belgian roots. 
It wasn't long before the new immigrants were forced into major issue the United States was facing, the American Civil War. War rosters were first filled by volunteers. When newspapers made more reports of casualties, the number of volunteers fell, forcing states like Wisconsin to start a draft. Belgians thought they were safe because they didn't consider themselves citizens, but the government stretched definitions to fit most men. In order for immigrants to get land, they had to sign a "Declaration of Intent" which said they intended to become United States citizens at some point. This made them eligible for the draft.
Draft Processes.
Each town's assessor was assigned to gather a list of men, age 18-45, healthy enough to fight. Belgian families felt they were unfairly targeted by those in charge of drafts. In Door County, 40 of the 63 men drafted were Belgian. There were options for men to skip the draft, but not many, especially Belgian men, were successful. Doctors were flooded by potential soldiers claiming disabilities, which would allow them to stay home. Among the ailments claimed, there were hernias, lameness, poor sight or hearing, varicose veins and ulcers. In September 1862, Dr. H. Pearce verified disability 246 of the 454 men that sought a way out. Of those, 21 were Belgian. Shortly after, the first Civil War draft in Wisconsin was in November 1862. Finances surely came into play when it came to paying out of the draft as ov 1863. Those who were desperate and able would pay $300 to get out of the war. A total of 862 men paid this, with a mere 18 of them being Belgian. The last option was for the draftee to find a substitute. This came into effect in 1864. It was difficult to find someone willing to go to war, but a substitute could have been a full-blooded Native American, a minor, or a non-citizen.
Riots.
After it seemed to many Belgian people that the draft was fixed, emotions began to run high. One of the biggest issues was the language barrier. Few Belgian immigrants spoke English, therefore could not understand why they were being drafted into a war they had no intent of being a part of. Anger soon overcame these men. They would form marches with clubs, pitchforks and guns. They wanted to see fair enrollment processes. In one of the most explosive demonstrations, colonists formed and marched into the city of Green Bay. They stood outside United States Senator Timothy Howe's home and demanded action. How addressed the crowd from his home. But because of the language barrier, the immigrants could not understand, Howe felt threatened and fled the city. Not feeling satisfied, the mob continued to march around the town until they found a fellow Belgian, O.J. Brice. Brice was able to calm the crowd in their native French. He explained that the drafing process would be filled with justice and fairness. The group was satisfied with his explanation in their own language. They then dissembled and returned home without damage or arrests.

Van Schaick and Company

Van Schaick and Company was an investment company that operated on the East Coast of the United States between 1857 and September 1911, when it fell victim to the Panic of 1910–1911. The company declared bankruptcy September 12, 1911 after it was unable to pay a bill of $100,000 out of a total debt of $600,000 (1911 dollars). At the time, the company had assets exceeding $3.5 million.
The company was founded on Oct. 7, 1857 by Jacob Van Schaick, who kept control of the company within his family. When the company declared bankruptcy, it was being managed by John B. Van Schaick and junior partner Derby Crandall, who rose to that position in 1907 after the death of managing partner A.S. Gorham. At the time of its bankruptcy, the company operated branch offices in Jersey City and Baltimore, Maryland, from its New York City headquarters.

Minyon Falls

The Minyon Falls is a plunge waterfall on the Repentance Creek in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. The waterfall descends more than over the huge rhyolite cliffs which were once part of the Tweed Volcano. The water flow eroded the underlying basalt away to create the waterfall.
Location and features.
The waterfall is a popular visitor attraction and is located within easy reach of the nearby town of Byron Bay in the Nightcap National Park, which was added to the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Site in 1986.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service manages the area as part of the Nightcap National Park, and provides facilities for visitors, including a 50m boardwalk to the lookout which is wheelchair accessible, several picnic tables and barbecue facilities at the top of the falls. The National Parks and Wildlife Service do not permit camping in the Minyon Falls area, but a camping ground is provided west of the falls at Rummery Park. Visitors are able to explore the bottom of the falls and the sub-tropical rainforest along designated walking trails, all of which involve steep hills, with some scrambling over wet rocks at the base of the falls. One trail follows a route from the top of the falls, across the ridge, near Quandong Falls, down into the valley to the bottom of the Minyon falls, it continues to Minyon Grass, then joins the road for back to the falls car park to form a loop. A shorter, track runs from Minyon Grass to the bottom of the falls. Another walking trail in the area is the Boggy Creek Walk from the Rummery Park Campground to the top of the Falls (45 minutes each way).
Flora and fauna.
The top of the falls is surrounded by wet sclerophyll forest with some very tall Blackbutt, Tallowwood and Flooded gum trees. Visitors to the falls regularly observe wildlife such as Lace Monitor (goanna), Kookaburra, Satin Bowerbird, Noisy Pitta, Eastern Yellow Robin, Peregrine Falcon, Bobuck Possum, Northern and Long-nosed Bandicoot, Tawny Frogmouth, Stoney Creek Frog, Red-eyed Green Tree Frog, Red-necked Pademelon and Carpet Python. There are also occasional Koala and Potoroo sightings.
The Minyon valley is a sub-tropical rainforest, vegetation includes: Bangalow Palm, Brushbox, Strangler Fig, Stream Lily, Walking Stick Palm, Rusty Rose Walnut, Blue Quandong, Broad Leaved Palm Lily, Tree Fern, Red Lilly Pilly, White Bark, Birds Nest Fern, Stag Horn Fern, Brushbox Orchid and Native Wisteria vine. Regular wildlife sightings include; Noisy Pitta, Eastern Yellow Robin, Eastern Whipbird, Wonga Pigeon, White-headed Pigeon, Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo, Little Shrike-thrush and Tree-creeper -there are occasional Potoroo and Green Tree Snake sightings. In wet weather conditions, visitors may be encounter leeches.
Access.
Minyon Falls' proximity to towns such as Byron Bay, Ballina and Lismore make it a popular attraction, and the falls can be reached by car in approximately 45 minutes (1 hour from Ballina or Lismore). The falls can also be visited from the Gold Coast, which is a 2-hour journey via the Pacific Highway. The road to the falls is an unsealed road and can be difficult at times to drive. 
Various local tour companies offer trips to the Minyon Falls, including several of the Nimbin Tour buses; the day walks are available to the bottom of the falls and night-time walks at the top of the falls.

Dragons' Den (Canada)

"Dragons' Den" is a Canadian television reality show, based on the internationally franchised "Dragons' Den" format which started off with the Japanese version in which aspiring entrepreneurs pitch business ideas to a panel of venture capitalists in the hopes of securing business financing. The show debuted on October 3, 2006 on CBC Television. It is hosted by Dianne Buckner and features a panel of five actual Canadian investors (termed "Dragons") who listen to pitches for investment opportunities from Canadian entrepreneurs and are given an opportunity to invest money in Canadian businesses.
Format.
Each typical episode features approximately eight pitches, along with a brief synopsis of a further three pitches which usually were rejected by the Dragons.
Each pitch begins with the entrepreneur specifying the amount they are seeking as an investment and the percentage of their business which they are offering in exchange. The entrepreneurs generally describe their business and provide financial details in respect of their costs, sales, and profit margins. Pitches range from those at the conceptual stage to full-fledged long-term businesses. The Dragons ask the entrepreneur questions in order to assess whether their business is one which they would consider investing in. Each Dragon ultimately will either make an offer to invest, or will declare that they "are out", meaning they are not interested in the business. Once all five Dragons are "out", the pitch ends.
While some entrepreneurs are made offers of exactly what they are seeking, most of the offers the Dragons make either seek a greater percentage of the business (equity) or seek a royalty on the sales of the business (this has become more prevalent in later seasons). The entrepreneurs and Dragons may then engage in negotiations until the available offers are either accepted (and a "deal" is made) or rejected.
While Dragons often partner up and make joint offers, they just as often make competing offers. Each of the Dragons has a unique set of skills and connections which sometimes results in the entrepreneur being forced to choose between offers (which might be offering the same or different economic terms) based on the "added" value the specific Dragon would bring to the business.
The main "rule" as set out at the start of every episode is that the entrepreneur is not permitted to accept an offer or multiple offers unless they would receive a total investment of "at least" the amount that they initially sought. The main ramification of this restriction is that entrepreneurs are often criticised for over-valuing their businesses. This is because the amount sought by the entrepreneur may be more than 50% of the value of their business as perceived by the Dragons (the Dragons rarely make deals for greater than 50%) and sometimes more than the entire value of the business as perceived by the Dragons. The restriction means the Dragons can not offer a lesser amount that is more in line with their perceived value of the business.
Notwithstanding the acceptances of offers on the show, and the handshake agreements, the offers on the show are generally subject to due dilligence by both parties and many "deals" made on the show do not ultimately close, or close at different terms than originally expected. The show sometimes offers updates on both deals which were made and entrepreneurs who were rejected, including certain special episodes focusing exclusively on updates.
Awards.

The Beautiful Person

The Beautiful Person () is a 2008 French drama television film directed by Christophe Honoré.
Plot.
The plot is related to the seventeenth-century French novel "La Princesse de Clèves". 
After the death of her mother, Junie (Léa Seydoux) transfers to the school that her cousin Mathias (Esteban Carjaval-Alegria) attends. She catches the attention of a lot of people, especially Otto (Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet) and Nemours (Louis Garrel), her Italian teacher. In Italian class, a record of Maria Callas singing Lucia plays, which causes Junie to rush out crying, leaving her affairs behind. Nemours sees a photo of her taken by another student and swipes it. After this, Nemours pursues her even though she has mixed feelings about it. He is so enamored by her that he breaks off his relationships with Florence Perrin, a teacher (Valerie Lang), and Marie, a student (Agathe Bonitzer). Nemours switches seats with Mathias during a field trip. Marie sees a letter left on the seat and it spreads throughout the student body. This letter is a love letter that all of the students think was written by Nemours. Junie, upon reading the letter, becomes very upset, believing that Nemours is in love with somebody else. Mathias goes to Nemours and explains that it was his letter from another boy named Martin and asked him to say that it belonged to the teacher. One of Otto's friends from the Russian language class is asked to spy on her after Junie acts cold to Otto and sees Nemours acting tender to Junie. He mistakes it for kissing and Otto confronts Junie about the misunderstanding. She denies it and goes home. Otto kills himself the next day by jumping from a very high floor at school. After Otto's suicide, Junie skips school for three weeks coming only after Nemours tells Mathias that he will be taking sick leave until the end of the semester. Nemours follows Junie around and she decides to approach him. He asks for some time to talk to her and they are seen running around the city like children. He takes her back to his room where she starts talking about love. He takes her home where they set a date for 5pm the day after next. Nemours waits till seven, then calls Mathias. He comes down and tells him that she left yesterday and is not allowed to say where and to forget about her. She also said she never wanted to see him again. Junie is seen on a ship departing for somewhere else.

Ray Train

Raymond Train (born 10 February 1951) is a former English football player, coach, scout and manager. He played primarily as a defensive midfielder, but also frequently played in more attacking positions, including as a striker. He amassed over 500 appearances in the Football League, and achieved promotion to the First Division with Carlisle United, Sunderland, Bolton Wanderers and Watford. After retiring as a player, Train turned to coaching, and briefly managed Walsall as a caretaker in the 1988–89 season.
Playing career.
Born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, Train started his career as an amateur at Bedworth United. He was rejected as a triallist by Coventry City due to his lack of height, but joined Walsall as an apprentice in 1967, and turned professional the following year. He remained at the club until 1971, when he joined Second Division side Carlisle United.
After 20 appearances in his debut season, Train established himself as a first-team regular at Carlisle. He played 48 times as the team finished just above the relegation places in 1972–73, and 32 times as they secured promotion the following season. He was everpresent during their First Division campaign, scoring twice, and remained at Carlisle for most of 1975–76, before joining Sunderland for £90,000 in March 1976. Sunderland were promoted as champions at the end of the season. Train left Sunderland for Bolton Wanderers in March 1977, and this time was involved in a title-winning campaign from the start, as Bolton won the 1977–78 Second Division title.
Train joined newly promoted Third Division side Watford in November 1978, for a fee of £50,000. He scored on his debut, a 1–1 draw against Mansfield Town at Vicarage Road on 2 December. He played a further 22 matches that season, as Watford secured promotion to the Second Division. He remained at Watford until 1981–82, the season in which Watford were promoted to the First Division for the first time in their history; Watford were the fourth club to achieve promotion to the top level of English football with Train on the books. At the end of the season, Train joined Oxford United for a fee of £10,000.
After leaving Watford, Train spent brief playing spells at Oxford, A.F.C. Bournemouth, Northampton Town and Tranmere Rovers, before returning to Walsall in 1986. He made his final appearance in January 1987, shortly before his 36th birthday.
Coaching career.
Train started his coaching career when he returned to Walsall, initially combining his playing duties with a role as youth team coach. He became caretaker manager in December 1988, following the departure of Tommy Coakley, but was unable to improve the team's results, and reverted to his previous role in January 1989. 
After a brief spell as community officer at Port Vale in 1990, Train joined Middlesbrough as a coach. During the 1991–92 season, Middlesbrough finished second in the Second Division, securing promotion to the Premier League for its inaugural season. He later became the club's chief scout, and remained at the club for a total of 13 years.

Louisa Margaret Dunkley

Louisa Margaret Dunkley (28 May 1866 – 10 March 1927) was an Australian telegraphist and labor organizer.
Biography.
Louisa Margaret Dunkley was born in Richmond, Melbourne, Australia. She was the daughter of William James Dunkley, a boot importer, and Mary Ann Regan, both from London, England. She was educated at Catholic girls schools. 
She began to work for the Postmaster-General's Department in 1882. She studied telegraphy and became an operator in 1888, and worked in Melbourne metropolitan post and telegraph offices. In 1890 she qualified as a telegraphist and was promoted to a position in the Chief Telegraph Office. While working as a telegraphist in the early 1890s, she became aware of the unequal pay and working conditions of the female operators. Learning of efforts by women telegraphists in New South Wales to achieve equality in pay and status, she formed a committee to advocate for similar improvements in the Post and Telegraph Department of Victoria. While her efforts resulted in pay increases for the women operators, they did not achieve equality with the male operators, and the resulting controversy resulted in her being transferred to a remote post office.
In 1900, Dunkley and other operators established the Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association in order to advocate for equal pay and working conditions. Mrs. Webb, a postmistress, was elected president, and Dunkley was elected vice president and spokesperson (1900–1904). She was elected as a delegate to a conference of telegraphists in Sydney in October 1900, and there presented her case for equality under the new Commonwealth Public Service conditions. While some at the conference opposed her, she was able to secure the support of Parliament, and, as a result, a provision for equal pay for female telegraphists and postmistresses was included in the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1902. The Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association continued to exist within the Australian Commonwealth Post and Telegraph Association, first as a state association and then a state branch of the federal body, until 1920. 
On 22 December 1903, Dunkley married Edward Charles Kraegen, secretary of the New South Wales and Commonwealth Post and Telegraph associations (1885–1904), and left the Post and Telegraph service. The couple had a daughter born in 1904, and a son born in 1906. Louisa Margaret Dunkley Kraegen died on 10 March 1927, in Longueville, Sydney, and is buried in Northern Suburbs Cemetery.
The Victorian federal electorate of Dunkley is named after her.

<doc id="31094752" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31094752" title="Hypersexual disorder">
Hypersexual disorder

Hypersexual disorder was proposed in 2010 for inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). It was under consideration but ultimately rejected for inclusion in the Appendix of the DSM (December 2012). The label "hypersexual disorder" was reportedly chosen because it did not imply any specific theory for what causes hypersexuality, which remains unknown. A proposal to add sexual addiction to the DSM system had been previously rejected by the APA, as not enough evidence suggested to them that the condition is analogous to substance addictions, as that name would imply.
In the diagnostic criteria proposed for Hypersexual Disorder by Kafka (2012), the label would apply when a person experiences several of the indicated symptoms (extreme amounts of time spent in the sexual activity, using the sexual activity in response to low mood or stress, failed attempts to reduce the behaviors, etc.). Moreover, it would apply only when the problem lasted six months or more, when person experienced significant distress or impairment in major life areas because of it, and when the problem was not directly caused by a medication or drugs, as well as other criteria. Under the proposal, an official diagnosis would also specify the which behavior(s) are problematic in the case: masturbation, pornography use, cybersex, etc.
The APA reports that the updated manual, called the DSM-5, will be released in 2013. The pre-2013 version of the manual, the DSM-IV-TR includes an entry called Sexual Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified (Sexual Disorder NOS), for disorders that are clinically significant, but do not have their own code. The DSM-IV-TR notes that Sexual Disorder NOS would apply to, among other conditions, "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used".

Rufus Franklin

Rufus William Franklin was an American criminal who served a life sentence in Alcatraz. He is best known for taking part in the third documented attempted escape from Alcatraz Prison with Thomas R. Limerick and James C. Lucas on the night of May 23, 1938.
Biography.
He was born in Alabama, in either Calhoun, Jefferson or Montgomery Counties. Franklin was originally sentenced to imprisonment for Bank Robbery, Motor vehicle theft and Assault charges. He was then transferred to Alcatraz, where he became inmate number 335-AZ.
Alcatraz escape attempt.
In the spring of 1938, Franklin, Thomas R. Limerick and James C. Lucas planned an escape from Alcatraz. Their escape plan began by incapacitating an unarmed guard supervising a work detail on the top floor. Once the supervisor was rendered unconscious, the convicts would escape through a window to the rooftop, where they would incapacitate an armed guard and leave the island via a seized police boat. They enacted their escape plan on May 23, 1938 in the prison's mat shop, where they assaulted Custodial Officer Royal Cline with hammer blows to his head. They proceeded to the roof, where an armed guard shot both Franklin and Limerick, although Lucas wasn't shot. Other guards arrived at the scene. Franklin, Limerick, and Lucas were cornered and surrendered to the guards.
Cline died of his injuries the next day, as did Limerick. 
Franklin and Lucas, the other surviving convict, were tried for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Pochano

Pochanos (fem. "pochanas") are former Mexican citizens that are both Pochos and Chicanos at the same time.
Chicano (fem. "chicana"), originally a term used by native-born Mexicans to describe persons of low class, low education and low morals. The perojative term has been taken on in the United States of America as unifying term for Mexican people that have emigrated to the USA and seeking to solidify their identity in a foreign land. Perhaps because they have not been able to assimilate successfully they have sought to create their own unifying identity.
Likewise, Pocho (fem. "pocha") is a term used by native-born Mexicans to describe Chicanos who are perceived to have forgotten or rejected their Mexican heritage to some degree. Typically, pochos speak English and lack fluency in Spanish. Among some pochos, the concept has been embraced to express pride in having both a Mexican and an American heritage, asserting their place in the diverse American culture. The word derives from the Spanish word "pocho", meaning fruit that has become rotten or discolored.

Trials and judicial hearings following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011

The trials and judicial hearings following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution were a series of legal moves to establish accountability among the various Egyptian government officials and prominent businessmen.
A series of arrests and travel bans was imposed on high profile figures following the ousting of the former president Hosni Mubarak's regime. These were based on several charges: causing the death of as many as 800 demonstrators; the injury of around 5,000 demonstrators; as well as embezzlement, profiteering, money laundering and human rights abuses. Notable figures arrested included Mubarak, his wife Suzanne, his sons Gamal and Alaa, former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly, former Housing Minister Ahmed El Maghrabi, former Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana, and the former secretary of the National Democratic Party for Organisational Affairs Ahmed Ezz. Arrest warrants were also issued for some public figures who had already left the country during the start of the revolution, mostly on charges of financial misappropriations. These included the former minster of trade and industry, Rachid Mohamed Rachid, and Hussein Salem, a business tycoon.
Mubarak's ousting was followed by widespread allegations of corruption against numerous other government officials and senior politicians. These included the former speaker of the Egyptian Parliament, Fathi Sorour, and the former speaker of the higher legislative body (Shura Council), Safwat El Sherif. Trials of the accused officials started on March 5, 2011, when the former interior minster of Egypt, Habib el-Adly, appeared before the Giza Criminal Court in Cairo. The trials of el-Adly and other public figures are expected to take a long time.
Background to the trials.
Allegations of corruption.
Political corruption in the Mubarak administration's Interior Ministry had risen dramatically due to the increased power over the institutional system necessary to prolong the presidency. The rise to power of prominent businessmen in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), in the government, and in the People's Assembly (Egyptian Parliament) led to waves of anger during the tenure of Prime Minister's Ahmed Nazif's government. An example is Ahmed Ezz's monopolization of the Egyptian steel industry by holding more than 60 percent of the market share. American professor Alaadin Elaasar, a noted Egyptian biographer, estimates that the Mubarak family is worth somewhere between $50 to $70 billion.
The perceptions of corruption, and its beneficiaries, being limited to businessmen with ties to the NDP had created a picture "where wealth fuels political power and political power buys wealth."
During the 2010 Egyptian parliamentary election opposition groups complained of harassment and fraud perpetrated by the government. As a result, opposition and civil society activists called for election reforms with changes to a number of legal and constitutional provisions.
In 2010 the Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index report assessed Egypt with a CPI score of 3.1 (with 10 being clean and 0 being totally corrupt), based on perceptions of the degree of corruption from business people and country analysts.
Allegations of human rights abuses.
On March 5–6, 2011, numerous Egyptian State Security buildings were stormed by demonstrators after eyewitnesses reported that officials were shredding and burning documents which could potentially serve as evidence against government officials. Fires were simultaneously witnessed in a number of Egyptian State Security offices, including the Cairo Downtown office (Lazoghly), the 6 October city office, and offices in Damanhour, Nasr City, Marsa Matrouh and Alexandria. Large amounts of shredded and burnt documents were found in these state security buildings. The demonstrators reportedly found evidence to support the widely accepted allegation of human rights abuses by Egyptian State Security. Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram" reported that the Damanhour office was perhaps the most panic provoking, as prison cells with electrocution equipment were found in close proximity to a secret graveyard.
Cases pertaining to public events.
Public disorder.
Numerous incidents of public disorder occurred from the start of the uprising. On January 28 the police withdrew from the streets of Egypt following break-ins to a number of prisons. Prison guards allegedly allowed and aided the escape of inmates. On February 2, a day that was dubbed the "Battle of the Camel", pro-government activists on camel- and horse-back stormed Tahrir Square in Downtown Cairo, where anti-regime demonstrators had set up camp, attacking them with Molotov cocktails, stones, chipped marble, swords and other weapons. This confrontation resulted in the deaths of 91 demonstrators and the injury of several hundreds. The government appointed a fact-finding panel to investigate the cause of these incidents, headed by judge Adel Koura.
The prosecution reported that, upon examining the sites where demonstrators were shot at, empty bullet-casings were found on the rooftops of buildings surrounding Tahrir Square, including the American University of Cairo (AUC). The AUC was closed at that time and it is believed that armed officers and regime loyalists had stormed the buildings and shot at the demonstrators. A similar scenario was reported in the area surrounding the Ministry of Interior in Cairo, where demonstrators were shot at from its roof. On March 10 Ismail el-Shaer, the former security chief of Cairo, was interviewed by prosecutors regarding these incidents. This was followed by the arrest of former Egyptian deputy interior minster Adly Fayed, chief of state security Hassan Abdulrahman, and chief of central security Ahmed Ramzy. All three were placed in custody for 15 days beginning on March 11.
Interrogation started the next day. "Al-Ahram" reported that a CD containing recordings of telephone conversations between Habib el-Adly and Ahmed Ramzy was examined as evidence. "Al-Ahram" also stated that Ramzy received orders from el-Adly to use live ammunition against anti-regime demonstrators. Ramzy denied this, but admitted that he ordered the use of rubber bullets and tear gas. He also stated that el-Adly ordered the withdrawal of the whole police force from the streets on the evening of January 28 only after the Egyptian military assumed responsibility. Ramzy claimed that this decision was made to avoid further confrontation between the police and the public. His account was supported by statements from Adly Fayed.
Ismail El-Shaer was also investigated for allegations of ordering the use of weapons against demonstrators and for causing public disorder, which he denied. He was also accused of being the driver in the widely publicized "van incident", in which a police van intentionally rammed into a large group of demonstrators. El-Shaer denied that as well and stated that he was in his office at the time of the incident.
On the day following the arrest and initial interrogation of el-Shaer, Ramzy, Fayed and Abdulrahman it was announced that the fact-finding panel headed by Judge Adel Koura has submitted four reports to the Egyptian prosecutor-general. Koura refused to name any officials who might have been legally charged with causing the death of protesters, but stated that the police force is not permitted to use live ammunition without authorization from the interior minster, whose decision must be approved by the country's political leadership.
The events of February 2 also led to allegations that members of the NDP funded and coordinated the activities of the regime loyalists who attacked demonstrators in Tahrir. The investigations of the fact-finding panel confirmed that two MPs from the NDP were involved. Both were named by "Al-Ahram" as Youssef Khatab and Abdulnasser el-Gabri and they were arrested on March 10.
On March 21 the fact finding panel submitted its final report to the military council in charge of Egypt. "Al-Ahram" reported some of the findings from this report, including that 685 demonstrators were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured during the aforementioned events - 1,200 with eye injuries and many with head injuries, indicating that regime forces assaulted them with intent to kill. The report named a number of political figures, businessmen, and police officers as suspects in those incidents.
Cases pertaining to individuals.
Mubarak family.
On February 28, 2011, Egyptian Prosecutor General Abdel Magid Mahmud put a freeze on the assets of ousted president Hosni Mubarak and his family and imposed a travel ban on them. Subsequently the Egyptian government asked the U.S. government and the European Union to freeze the assets of the Mubaraks whilst investigating the widespread allegations of profiteering by Mubarak, his wife Suzanne, and their sons Alaa and Gamal. On March 6 Mohamad Hamouda, Mubarak's lawyer during his presidency, stated that he agreed to represent Mubarak on certain conditions, including that the Mubarak family inform him of their exact assets. Hamouda also stated that Mubarak will take legal action against "The Guardian" and "The New York Times" for defamation. On the following day Hamouda withdrew from legal representation for the Mubaraks citing his "discomfort" with the case. Hamouda stated that achieving justice in this case will be difficult and explained that he was given only three days to review evidentiary documents and, two days into this period, he had not yet received these documents from the prosecutor. Hamouda stated that another lawyer, Mourtada Mansour, would represent the Mubaraks. Cairo criminal court was scheduled to start proceedings in this case on March 8, 2011. On that day neither Mubarak nor his council appeared in court. The court reaffirmed the travel ban on the Mubarak family and upheld the decision by the prosecutor to freeze the Mubaraks' accounts, citing that there is sufficient evidence to suspect Mubarak and his family of profiteering and misappropriation of public funds. The Mubaraks were contesting the travel ban in appeals court, while a criminal court was to convene to consider the financial charges.
The general prosecutor, Abdel Magid Mahmud, ordered the financial assets inside Egypt of Mubarak and his family members to be frozen, "Al Jazeera" reported. On March 17, 2011, Senator John Kerry, head of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, officially confirmed the U.S. government had frozen assets worth $31 billion belonging to Mubarak, including property and bank accounts.
On April 13 the general prosecutor ordered the arrest of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his sons, Alaa and Gamal, for 15 days as part of an inquiry into the use of force and violence against pro-democracy demonstrators, and the charges of corruption.
On June 1, it was announced by the ruling Supreme Military Council of Egypt that Mubarak was due to stand trial on August 3. On July 25, it was decided that the former Interior Minister Habib Al Adly would be put on trial for charges of human rights violations and premeditated murder of protesters during the January 25 Revolution alongside Mubarak and his sons, Alaa and Gamal. There was considerable speculation regarding the issue of whether Mubarak would really stand trial, given the contradictory and controversial reports of his medical status and the perceived prejudice of the ruling Military Council in attempting to prevent Mubarak's trial. However, on August 3, 2011, Mubarak and his sons along with Habib Al Adly did stand trial in the Cairo Police Academy. Mubarak was transported from his hospital at Sharm el Sheikh to Cairo in the early hours of that day on a military aircraft. Egypt awoke in much tension and anticipation at the trial. Clashes were witnessed between pro-Mubarak and anti-Mubarak protesters outside the Police Academy, which were promptly dispersed by the Egyptian police forces. A heavy and concentrated military and security presence was deployed at the trial location, with up to 5000 troops and 500 tanks. Mubarak was placed along with all the defendants in the trial, which included Adly, Mubarak's sons Gamal and Alaa, as well as 6 top aides and associates of Al Adly, in an iron cage as the court proceedings opened. The first day of the trial witnessed an enunciation of the indictment of Mubarak, the accusations and allegations and legal charges directed against him by the Prosecution, which accused him of money laundering, illegally profitting from the sale of natural gas to Israel below international market rates, as well as charges of misappropriation of public funds, sale of state property, and corruption. The Prosecution also asserted that Mubarak had issued instructions to security forces to open fire on demonstrators, which had killed 846 people in the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Mubarak's lawyer Farid al Deeb countered with outlining his 7 demands, chief among which was his insistence that Mubarak's trial would be separated from Al Adly's, as well as arguing for legal action to be undertaken against Muhammad Hussein Tantawi, the current chairman of the ruling Supreme Military Council, alleging his shared responsibility in Mubarak's crimes. Mubarak and the other defendants were allowed to give their statements in response to the accusations filed against them from the Prosecution, to which all of them replied unequivocally that they categorically denied the charges and accusations directed against them, instead claiming they were innocent. The trial concluded with the decision that judicial proceeedings would be adjourned to August 15.
In September, 2011, police officer Mohamed Abdel-Hakim became the fifth witness to change the testimony he had given in secret before the prosecution when giving his first testimony in court. "He said 24 soldiers from Central Security Forces used two guns to fire teargas at protesters and two starting pistols to help disperse them. He denied that they used live ammunition against protesters ...

In January, 2012, prosecutor Moustafa Khater, one of a five-member prosecution team, "demanded on Thursday that the ousted Egyptian leader be sentenced to death by hanging on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during last year's uprising against his rule also asked the judge for the death sentence for Mubarak's security chief and four top police commanders being tried in the same case.
On June 2, 2012, Hosni Mubarak was sentenced to life imprisonment. He started serving his term on June 4, at Tora Prison near Cairo.
Rachid Mohamed Rachid.
Rachid Mohamed Rachid became Egypt's Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry in July 2004. On January 28, 2011, Mubarak dissolved his then cabinet to form the last cabinet before his ousting. It was reported that Rachid, who was in Dubai at the time of the revolution, was offered a ministerial position in Mubarak's last cabinet which he refused. Rachid became the first high profile figure to be accused of financial irregularities when he was charged while Mubarak was still in office. The timing of the allegations of financial irregularities against Rachid raised some doubts as to whether these allegations were actually disseminated in response to Rachid's refusal to accept an office in Mubarak's last government, or to be scapegoated as the public call for an end to corruption was becoming louder.
Habib el-Adly.
The trial of Habib el-Adly follows two streams of legal charges: the first pertains to profiteering activities, and the second pertains to allegations that el-Adly ordered the use of live ammunitions against the demonstrators, during the January 2011 protests in different Egyptian cities, and was responsible for the opening of different jails in Egypt during the protests in order to cause criminal unrest and justify the use of force. A fact-finding panel was formed to assess the responsibility for incidents of criminal unrest. On March 9 the Egyptian daily newspaper "Almasry Alyoum" reported that el-Adly's charges in this case may have been of a political rather than criminal nature; evidence made available to the fact-finding mission suggested that he might have acted on orders from former president Mubarak and not on his own accord.
El-Adly appeared before the Giza Criminal Court on March 5 where he was formally charged with profiteering and money laundering. These charges relate to allegations that el-Adly received a bribe of 4.5 million Egyptian pounds to allow a contractor to carry out building work on behalf of the Egyptian ministry of interior. El-Adly pleaded not guilty and the court proceedings were adjourned to April 2, to allow el-Adly's council to review the evidence. This trial was described by "Al-Ahram" as the "Egyptian trial of the century." El-Adly's police department was widely feared by Egyptians and the allegations, that he was responsible for the widespread thuggery that occurred during and after the Egyptian protests from January 25 to February 12 by opening jails, led to large demonstrations in front of the Giza Courthouse calling for el-Adly's execution.
More details from the investigation of el-Adly were published on March 18 in the "Dostur" newspaper, which reported that el-Adly described his subordinates and the political leadership of Egypt of having used him as a scapegoat. He reportedly alleged that the decision to deal with the demonstrations was a joint decision involving the political leadership, including Mubarak, who called for ending the anti-regime demonstrations at any price.
Anas el-Fiqqi.
Anas el-Fiqqi was the Minister of Youth and subsequently became the Minister of Information from February 2004 to February 2011. He was implicated in the harassment of journalists during the 2011 Egyptian revolution and for the closure of news channels such as Al Jazeera in Cairo. On February 12, the day after the president stepped down, he resigned and was reportedly placed under house arrest. El-Fiqqi was charged with financial irregularities and became subject to investigations. His detention was renewed for 15 days on March 9 for further investigation of reports that he misappropriated funds, used public funds to support the NDP and for personal purchases, and received a bribe to allocate the advertising rights from an Arab media festival to the nephew of Mubarak's office manager.
Ahmed El-Maghrabi.
In February 2011 Maghrabi was accused of wasting public money and seizing state land following a cabinet purge by then President Hosni Mubarak.
Zoheir Garana.
On March 6 the Egyptian daily newspaper "Alwafd" reported that the Prosecutor General of Egypt referred Zoheir Garana, the tourism minster in Mubarak's regime, to a Cairo criminal court on suspicions of embezzlement and profiteering. Garana was accused of misusing public funds amounting to 51 million Egyptian pounds. It is noteworthy that Garana was arrested and placed on remand more than a week before the court referral order was issued by the Prosecutor General.
Garana has not formally been put on trial, but rather detained in Tora Prison on suspicions concerning the scapegoating of officials, differential or preferential justice. As with many of those charged in the aftermath of the Egyptian Revolution, Garana's decisions and actions were seen as compliant with the policies set by the government in which he served. The 51 million Garana is accused of misusing refers to the sale of a five million square meter piece of land in Ein el-Sokhna. Mr. Garana sealed the deal in accordance to a presidential decree made on July 4, 2005, where the price was $1 per meter. It is claimed that Garana alloted pieces of land at a low price to a company he owns, "Royal".
Concerns.
Judiciary.
On March 21 "Alwafd" reported that the possibility of a deal between the prosecution and some of those accused of embezzlement was explored. "Alwafd" stated that this option was explored after the prosecution was successful in striking a deal with some creditors and business borrowers to repay a total of 13 billion Egyptian pounds in return for dropping legal charges. The situation, according to "Alwafd", proved more complex as the offers made by the accused, in return for dropping the embezzlement charges, were seen as unrealistic.
Public opinion.
Concerns were raised that the accused would not be treated fairly due to the overwhelming public opinion against them. In an interview with the "Shabab Alahram" newspaper a well-known Egyptian lawyer, Mohamed Hamoouda, stated that his decision to withdraw from Hosni Mubarak's council was triggered by his belief that justice will not be achieved in these cases (see above under Mubarak's case). On March 8 Hamouda argued that these cases should be deferred until a later stage to ensure better administration of justice.
Embezzlement vs. human rights abuse charges.
The first wave of legal actions following Mubarak's resignation was dominated by charges of financial nature, including bribery, misappropriation of funds, profiteering, embezzlement and money laundering. This caused concerns, particularly in the case of Habib el-Adly whose public image was much more eroded by allegations of human rights abuses, yet only faced legal charges over financial matters during the first wave of legal action. On March 16 the families of some of the protesters killed by the police demonstrated in front of the office of the general prosecutor of Egypt for what they saw as exclusive focus on financial cases at the expense of human rights cases. Some of these families claimed that the legal files pertaining to their slain relatives were not yet received by the prosecution.
Allegations of concealment and disposal of evidentiary documents.
On March 5–6 numerous Egyptian State Security buildings were stormed by demonstrators after reports that officials were witnessed shredding and burning documents that could serve as evidence against government officials. The fires, which occurred at several state security offices, were witnessed the day after the government of Ahmed Shafik, the last minister appointed by Mubarak, had resigned. Large amounts of shredded and burnt documents were found in the various state security buildings. The demonstrators reportedly found some documents, CDs, video and audiotape recordings pertaining to a number of recent events in Egypt, including the explosion in the Two Saints Church in Alexandria on December 31, 2010, in which the state security apparatus, under el-Adly, was allegedly involved. Documents pertaining to spying, blackmailing and torture activities were also found and handed over to the state prosecutor.
On March 6, 2011, it was reported that among the documents that were found in a readable condition in the Egyptian State Security buildings, was a file from the office of Hassan Abdulrahman. As the former deputy interior minster under Mubarak he gave instructions to various branches of Egyptian State Security buildings to shred archived documents. These documents were believed to contain relevant information to the widespread allegations of human rights abuses by the Egyptian State Security. In an interview with BBC Arabic TV on March 7 General F. Allam, previous deputy director of the Egyptian State Security, stated that the burning of these documents will not impact on the evidence required for any court case - as copies of all these documents are automatically archived in confidential locations. General Allam argued that an order might have indeed been issued to shred or burn the documents due to fears that they may fall "in the wrong hands" if state security buildings were stormed by demonstrators. The same day of the interview 47 officers from the Egyptian State Security were arrested on suspicions of involvement in damaging these documents.

<doc id="31094794" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31094794" title="Castros in Spain">
Castros in Spain

A castro is a fortified settlement, usually pre-Roman, some from late Bronze Age and Iron Age, the oldest research associated with the Celtic culture. These are frequently found in the Northern Spain, particularly in Asturias, Galicia, Cantabria, Basque Country and the province of Ávila, with the Castro culture and on the plateau with Las Cogotas culture.
The word "castro" comes from the Latin "castrum", which means "hill fort".
Castros of the Castro culture.
The castro is a fortified village that began to be inhabited from the 6th century BC, lacking streets of right angles and full of construction almost always circular. The oldest houses were mostly of straw-mud and the latest masonry. The roof was made of branches and mud and after long poles. Basically, they were unique rooms. These are located in naturally protected areas (heights, riots rivers, small peninsulas), close to water sources and arable land and on the border between these and higher areas of grazing.
The castros were protected by one or more pits, parapets and walls that bordered the inhabited recint, may have in its accesses a torreón, which controlled the entryways to itself or another strategic location.
In times of conflict, the people who lived in open field moved to these strategically located buildings to ensure their safety. The buildings could also have other purposes such as control of territory, vigilance of crops, etc.
Its situation on the territory compared to other castros suggests that there was a definite strategy when choosing its location, allowing the communication by signals between them as a defensive network.
The maximum flowering time was between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC and show greater business contact with the outside of the south than the north, and the coastal than the inland. Some historians argue that in the first mid-1st century BC there was a multiplication of castros (either for population growth or for other reasons). At the end of the century, coinciding with the final phase of the Roman conquest, some with signs of destruction of the walls and in some cases immediate reoccupation.
Types of castros.
Inland castros.
These are the most common and characteristic. These are located on hills or prominent elevations, but rarely in high summits. They are circular or oval and have one or more walls. An example is the castro of Coaña (Asturias).
Mountain castros.
Located in high mountainous areas, are located on the slopes and are oval, with artificial pits on the upper side and walls or embankments into the valley. Dating back to Roman times and are linked to mining. Two examples include the of the Vilar in the Sierra de Caurel and Xegunde in Fonsagrada (Lugo).
Coastal castros.
Are of varied plant, but usually round or oval, adapting to the terrain. The natural defenses of the sea are complemented by walls and moats into the inland. These are very abundant and an example are the Baroña in the Sierra of Barbanza.
Urbanism of the castros.
The Castro villages tend to be constructed in cleared hills, rocky headlands or peninsulas that stretch into the sea, which provides visibility, defense and the contour domain. The place of settlement is given also in terms of natural resources exploited by the residents. The castros have an upper enclosure, the "croa" and a series of terraces laid down where are the buildings. Each of these sections may be limited by walls, parapets or pits. Sometimes there is a kind of additions, the antecastros, which is also surrounded by walls but do not harbor houses, so it is assumed that these were intended for animals or orchards.
The castros tend to have a single entrance, which also serves to prevent passage. In some cases is a simple thickening of the tops of the walls, in others, a panel of the wall surpasses the other, forming a narrow corridor. It is assumed that they closed with wooden doors.
The defenses of the castros do not seem to meet war needs, but of prestige and symbolic boundaries of the inhabited space. In fact, few weapons were found. In addition to natural defenses, there are structures of three types:
The most common is the absence of urban organization. In the 1st century appear clusters of buildings ("neighborhoods"), consisting of several buildings surrounded by a wall with one opening facing the street. This arrangement is common in large towns, and in more modest towns like Castro do Vieito. These may be households in which a building would be housing and the other, silos and warehouses. The houses do not share dividing walls, but are separated from the others. It is not known whether this is a reflection of the idiosyncrasies of this culture or because of the difficulty to do in a circular building. The houses also do not have windows.
The floor of the houses was of mud trod. Prior to the 2nd-3rd century BC, the walls were usually built of adobe, with a central pole. Subsequently it used masonry more or less in horizontal rows (or polygonal, in some cases). The covers were made of branches covered with mud and reinforced by weights or subsequent of tiles. From the 1st century and due to Roman influence, become more usually square or rectangular. The essential element of a house is the home, that in the change of era was located at the center and was made of slate or clay and by the end of the 1st century it shifted to one side and was, in some cases, with shingles.
It is suspected that some large buildings, where a stone bench runs along the wall and in which are not remains of room, could have been room enclosures. It has also ceramic and pottery kilns, usually next to the exits or outside.

<doc id="31094840" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31094840" title="Mikkeller">
Mikkeller

Mikkeller is a microbrewery founded in 2006 in Copenhagen, Denmark that is based on the so-called "phantom" or "gypsy" ethos; that is, the company does not operate an official brewery and, instead, collaborates with other brewers to produce their recipes or experimental one-off brews. The brewery was founded by two home brewers: Mikkel Borg Bjergsø, a high school teacher, and journalist Kristian Klarup Keller. Both sought to introduce their home-brewed beer to the public and to "challenge beer friends with intense new tastes", drawing inspiration from the American breweries that "aren't afraid to play and break all the rules".
History.
Inception and development: 2005–2007.
Before founding the company, self-taught home brewers Bjergsø and Keller experimented on brewing, first by trying to clone existing beers. After success in blind tastings, the two started creating their own recipes and joined multiple home brewing competitions in Denmark, eventually winning many of them. The brewery's activity was small, with a low level of public visibility, as the brewing was kitchen-based and the beer was only served at a few beer enthusiast meetings and in small local bars. Bjergsø's brother founded a beer shop in 2005 and began to distribute the pair's beer to select destinations in numerous countries. In 2006, encouraged by wider appeal, Bjergsø and Keller founded the Mikkeller brewing company, named after their home brewery operation.
In late 2006, an experimental Mikkeller beer called "Beer Geek Breakfast" garnered fame for the fledgling brand when it won in the stout category of an international beer voting event. Following this recognition, Mikkeller made its first official appearance at the Copenhagen Beer Festival, where the brewery successfully introduced eight different beers, garnering further acclaim. The attention that occurred in the second half of 2006 resulted in an international distribution deal, and to cope with demand, Mikkeller started to brew in established breweries by paying rent for the machinery and costs of the brewing process. Therefore, the small company could continue production even though it did not have the funds to invest in a facility and professional brewing equipment.
Keller parted ways with the company in 2007, as he was not interested in production and crafting a greater number of beers, while Bjergsø was eager to constantly create new recipes and tastes. Keller quit brewing in order to pursue his career as a journalist, leaving Bjergsø to oversee the brewery.
Establishment and expansion: 2008 onward.
Mikkeller's beers are sold in over 40 countries around the world, while only 10 per cent of Mikkeller's beers are sold in Denmark. Mikkeller's style of brewing is considered to be unique, since many of its beers are experimental with novel tastes. During its history, Mikkeller has brewed over 600 different beers in a wide variety of styles, unlike many other microbreweries.
Mikkeller's releasing pace is considerable; in 2013 alone the brewery introduced 124 different beers. Some of the beers are constantly in production, while most of the products are available for a limited time; or in small batches; or at a certain location; or all of these factors combined. With a high number of different beers and a popular reputation among beer enthusiasts worldwide, the Mikkeller microbrewery struggles to meet the demand for its beer.
Consistent with the company's early years, Mikkeller continues to brew solely at a variety of host facilities—mainly at de Proefbrouwerij in Belgium, but also at breweries in Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). All of the various recipes are engineered at Mikkeller's own facility in Copenhagen; altogether, the company's annual output is 8,500 hectolitres of beer.
Retail.
While Mikkeller does not operate an official brewery, its home base is the "Mikkeller Bar" in Copenhagen, which the company owns. In March 2013, Mikkeller and another Danish microbrewery, To Øl, opened a second Mikkeller bar in Copenhagen called "Mikkeller & Friends". At the same time, a "Mikkeller Bottle Shop" opened, selling bottled beers from Mikkeller and "other praiseworthy microbreweries around the world". Mikkeller also operates an online web store, where consumers can choose from a small, changing assortment of Mikkeller beer, in addition to merchandise, such as shirts and glassware.
In July 2013, the first international Mikkeller bar was opened in San Francisco, California, US. The San Francisco bar uses the new "on-the-fly" beer taps that allows the beer to be poured in a very sophisticated and controlled manner. Beer, water and carbon dioxide are blended in a precise manner and the product is served at the correct temperature, with variations applying to different styles of beer.
In late 2013, Mikkeller announced the January 2014 launch of its second foreign bar, located in Bangkok, Thailand. The brand partnered with an already established Thai-based beer distribution company and seeks to capitalise on the higher earning capacity of Thai people, as well as tourists. At the opening, one of the owners explained: "... and we thought it was about time to elevate the level of craft beer available in Thailand and, hopefully, expand throughout Southeast Asia." A total of 30 beers are served at the venue, including two microbrews exclusive to Thailand.
In February 2014, Mikkeller announced the opening of a third Scandinavian bar to be located in Stockholm, Sweden.
Collaborations.
In addition to regular brewing, Mikkeller also produces collaborative beers with other breweries, such as BrewDog, To Øl, Nøgne Ø, Lervig Aktiebryggeri, Jester King, Evil Twin, Three Floyds, Cigar City and AleSmith. Mikkeller has also brewed "house beers" for restaurants (even Michelin starred ones) and bars in Denmark and several other countries.
Some of the breweries Mikkeller has collaborated with are the result of close past relationships. When working as a mathematics and physics teacher in high school, Bjergsø taught two of his students how to brew beer outside of school hours, and in 2010 they started their own microbrewery, To Øl. Additionally, Brooklyn-based Evil Twin's founder and operator is Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø, Mikkel's twin brother.
Copenhagen Beer Celebration.
Since 2010, Mikkeller has organized and hosted a large annual beer festival, the Copenhagen Beer Celebration, which takes place each year in May. The festival mainly features small breweries from around the world, with many of them premiering new beers or small one-off batches of special beer, brewed specifically for the festival.
Awards.
Mikkeller won the "Danish Brewery of the Year" award in its inaugural year, in 2006, and again in 2008; in 2009 the award was shared with Hornbeer. Mikkeller has also been judged the fifth best brewery in the world on two occasions.

The Living Christ Series

The Living Christ Series is a 12-part drama series about the life of Jesus Christ. In some ways, it was a version of the typical Hollywood serial film. Each episode was thirty minutes long, bringing the total running time of the series to what might have been considered an epic six hours long if the films had been shown consecutively. Filmed in color in 1951, it is notable for being one of the few American film series of that time in which Christ's face was actually shown. Since the early days of sound, American film producers had been afraid that some members of the audience would be alienated if an actor who did not fit the public's image of Christ was chosen to play the role, so virtually all had played it safe by showing Him only from the back or in long shot. Sometimes only Christ's hand would be seen. Foreign film makers, however, had no such doubts, and Christ was actually shown in such films as the French "Golgotha" (1935), the Mexican "El Martir del Calvario" (1952), and the 1953 British serial "Jesus of Nazareth".
However, "The Living Christ Series" was not meant to be shown in movie theatres, but more as an instructional, inspirational film in churches or on Sunday-morning television. Far from being a religious epic, the series was clearly shot mostly on soundstages and on a low budget, much like a typical television program of the era shot on film. Directed by John T. Coyle, the series featured mostly unknown actors or actors who appeared mostly in B-films. A notable exception was Lowell Gilmore, who played Pontius Pilate, and whose most famous previous role was as Basil Hallward in MGM's classic 1945 film "The Picture of Dorian Gray". Character actor Lawrence Dobkin also appeared in the series, and Will Wright, perhaps most famous for appearing as Ben Weaver on several episodes of "The Andy Griffith Show", was somewhat incongruously cast as Herod. Screen unknown Robert Wilson, who would go on to practically make a career out of playing the role, portrayed Christ. Noted movie trailer announcer Art Gilmore served as narrator.
"The Living Christ Series", like other similar religiously-themed films, was released by Cathedral Films. It has been released on VHS and DVD, both in separate volumes and in a boxed set.

Kiyosumi Garden

History.
According to one theory, this garden was the part of the residence of the famous Edo Period business magnate, Kinokuniya Bunzaemon.
In the Kyōhō period (1716-1736), it became the location of the Edo residence of the feudal lord Kuze Yamatonokami, of Sekiyamo, who built his mansion here in 1721 and this is the period when the basic form of the garden came into existence.
In the Meiji Era, Iwasaki Yatarō, the founder of Mitsubishi, acquired the land. In 1878, he ordered the garden rebuilt to use it for the enjoyment of his employees and entertainment of important guests. Hills and waterless waterfalls were constructed and 55 huge rocks from all over Japan were brought in. In 1880 the garden was opened. In later years, the waters of the Sumida-gawa were brought into the grounds to enlarge the pond.
The garden provided refuge for many citizens from the fires that followed the great earthquake of 1923. In 1932, Mitsubishi group contributed this garden to Tokyo City and after some repair works it was opened to the public in 1932.
On March 31, 1979 this garden was designated as Tokyo Metropolitan Place of Scenic Beauty.
Features.
The pond has three islands, one of which is connected with a bridge. There are "iso-watari" — this term refers to the stepping stone pathways that lead across shallow parts of the pond. When crossing the pond using "iso-watari", one can view the fish in the pond. It teems with carp, turtles, and waterfowls. Its location near the river and the bay attracts a large number of birds. There are over 4000 trees in this constricted space. Japanese Black pine ("Pinus thunbergii") are the dominant trees. Purple azaleas, "Hydrangea macrophylla", "Iris ensata" and Taiwan cherry ("Prunus campanulata") provide seasonal color.
The Iwasaki family collected fine and beautiful stones from all over Japan, brought to Tokyo on their steamships and placed around the garden. Including the flagstones and iso-watari stones, the total number of stones used is immense and the garden can indeed be perceived as a stone garden.
Famous haiku poem of Matsuo Bashō
can be seen carved on the monument stone.
The park is located approximately 3 minutes' walk from Kiyosumi-shirakawa Station, on the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line and the Toei Ōedo Line. It is open　from 09:00 until 17:00, the entrance fee is 150 yen for adults.

Echo TV

Echo TV is a conservative Hungarian television channel owned and operated by Echo Hungária TV Zrt, and founded in 2005 to cover business news. Now focusing on news broadcasting and public affairs, Echo TV has received controversial attention for its association with far-right politics in Hungary.
Creation.
Echo TV founded as a business news channel in 2005
at the initiative of Gábor Széles, one of Hungary's richest men and the head of Videoton Holding, a contract electronics manufacturer. Széles had only days previously purchased Hungary's daily "Magyar Hírlap"; the acquisition of both stations helped Széles establish a major media presence in Hungary. Széles reportedly spent two billion Hungarian forints in creating Echo TV. 
In 2006 Echo TV became a media partner of Feratel media technologies AG, based in Austria.
Association with far-right politics.
According to "Le Monde", Echo TV is a forum favored among neofascists in Hungary.
After the 2010 election in Hungary, Echo TV displayed an image of Imre Kertész, a Hungarian survivor of Auschwitz and nobel laureate, alongside a voiceover about rats. Sándor Pörzse was a well-known host for Echo TV before helping to found Jobbik's paramilitary organization the "Hungarian Guard," later banned by the Hungarian Government. Sándor Pörzse was removed from the Echo TV in 2009.
One of Echo TV's better known broadcasters is Ferenc Szaniszló, known for his racist and anti-Semitic statements. In 2011, Hungary's media regulator fined Echo 500,000 Forints after Szaniszló compared Roma people to "monkeys".

The Bushbabies

The Bushbabies is a children's novel by Canadian author William Stevenson published in 1965. The book was inspired by Stevenson's own life in Kenya, where his daughter Jackie, to whom the book is dedicated, kept a bushbaby named Kamau as a pet. The fictional aspects of the novel involve Jackie Rhodes and her father's African servant Tembo escaping across the wilderness from a pack of man-hunters who have been led to believe that Tembo has kidnapped Jackie. The book features illustrations by Victor Ambrus.
Though the novel has had two major adaptations, a theatrical motion picture from MGM in 1969 and an animated series from Japan's Nippon Animation in 1992, it is currently out of print.
Plot summary.
Jackie Rhodes is the daughter of a respected gamekeeper, known as "Trapper" Rhodes, in Kenya. She has lived there all of her life, so she is astounded and saddened when she learns from Tembo, her father's African servant, that her family will soon be abandoning the continent. Her biggest concern immediately becomes her pet bushbaby Kamau, which had been a Christmas gift from her father; she fears the creature is too young to fend for itself and will perish if left behind. During a family picnic, Trapper Rhodes comforts Jackie by assuring her that he'll obtain an official export permit that will allow her to take the bushbaby along.
The trio head by bus and foot towards the village of Vipingo. At her father's cottage Jackie and Tembo plan their next move while becoming increasingly acquainted with one another, which soothes the girl's fears. Meanwhile, Kamau encounters a praying mantis and Jackie observes the bushbaby's hunting abilities, growing less concerned about its ability to survive on its own. Unfortunately, the area is affected by a drought and an unexpected encounter with a rat snake foreshadows the dangers that they'll face in their journey. Jackie, who had hoped to be helped by Major Bob, a friend of the family, is astounded to learn that he's abandoned his home. When she approaches the Vipingo post office, she overhears the Hadj speaking to a gathering of villagers. He shows them the police's official order for the arrest of the black man who is believed to have kidnapped the white Rhodes girl. Horror-stricken, Jackie returns to Tembo and tells him that they must leave the place immediately.
Back aboard the ship, Jackie's family discover her absence and request that the ship be turned around, a suggestion that coincides with Captain MacRae's plans to avoid a threatening sea storm brewing in the Indian Ocean.
A prolonged drought is upsetting the many animals of the African savanahs as they follow the trails of the elephants in search of water. This complicates Tembo and Jackie's journey across the grasslands as they face dangerous creatures. The most dangerous encounter, however, is with an elephant poacher sent out to kill Tembo. Tembo manages to wrestle the man and send him running, but not before one of his poisoned arrowheads strikes Jackie's upper arm.
Characters.
Jackie Rhodes - A thirteen-year-old girl and the protagonist in the novel. She is physically described as having corn blond hair and blue eyes, a slightly crooked nose and a wide mouth, as well as thin legs too long for her age. She is tomboyish and awkward; her foolish choices stir a great deal of trouble which are the core of the novel.
Tembo Murumbi - Trapper Rhodes' servant, assistant and close family friend. He is left behind when the family leaves Kenya and meets Jackie after she abandons the ship. Moved by a close friendship and sense of duty, he willingly agrees to help Jackie in her journey to return Kamau to his natural habitat. Sadly, news spread out that he has kidnapped Jackie and the African officials soon put a prize on his head, with orders to shoot him on sight.
Adaptations.
Feature film.
The novel was adapted into a major motion picture from Metro Goldwyn Mayer in 1965 entitled "The Bushbaby". The film was produced and directed by John Trent and featured young Margaret Brooks in the role of Jackie Leeds and Lou Gossett, Jr. as Tembo. The film was not very well received and suffered the same fate as the novel; after a 1993 VHS release from MGM/UA, it was never again re-released in any part of the globe. The novel was re-published in paperback following the theatrical release of this picture, retitled "The Bushbaby" and featuring an image of Brooks as Jackie on the cover.
Animated series.
The most popular adaptation of the novel was an anime series from Nippon Animation, , the studio's 1992 installment of its World Masterpiece Theater showcase. The 40-episode series was directed by Takayoshi Suzuki and written by Akira Miyazaki. Though the series' recognition falls short when compared to other works of its kind ("Anne of Green Gables", 1979 or "Little Women", 1987), it remains the most known version of the story, surpassing both Stevenson's novel and the MGM film significantly. The series has been popular in its native Japan and has been dubbed into several languages and shown in their respective countries, among them Spain ("Jackie y su mascota"), Italy ("Le voci della savana"), Germany ("Buschbabies: Im Land des wilden Tiere") and France ("Jackie dans la savane"). An English dub of the series was produced for broadcast in Canada. Unlike the other works, the series is available for purchase on a DVD collection in Japan.

Ray Barnhart

Ray Anderson Barnhart (January 12, 1928 – May 26, 2013) was a businessman and Republican politician, formerly from Pasadena in Harris County, Texas.
From 1981 to 1987, Barnhart was director of the Federal Highway Administration under U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. In 1976, he, along with Ernest Angelo of Midland, and Barbara Staff of Dallas were co-chairmen of the Reagan presidential primary campaign against sitting President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. From 1973 to 1974, Barnhart was a one-term member of the Texas House of Representatives. He previously served on the Pasadena City Council from 1965 to 1969.
Background.
Barnhart was born to Ora E. Barnhart (1904–1991) and the former Alice Mildred Anderson in Elgin in Kane County west of Chicago in northeastern Illinois, to the east of Reagan's birthplace in Tampico in western Illinois. An Eagle Scout, Barnhart graduated from Elgin High School in January 1945, a semester earlier than most of his classmates. He enlisted in the United States Army and served from 1946 to 1947. Thereafter, he studied speech and theatre arts at Marietta College in Marietta, Ohio, from which he obtained the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950. He married the former Jacqueline Price (born 1927) in Bellaire in Belmont County, Ohio. In 1951, he received a Master of Arts in speech, theater, and radio communication from the University of Houston, Texas. He returned to Marietta College as a professor from 1951 to 1955. With an ending salary of $3,050 annually at Marietta College, the Barnharts relocated to Houston, where he entered the construction businesses. He first dug water and sewer lines and later specialized in underground utilities. Thereafter, he was an insurance agent from 1978 to 1981.
State politics.
Barnhart’s political interest began with two terms on the city council in Pasadena, which he describes at the time as "a lovely community but politically corrupt." He and other businessmen worked to establish a mayor-council form of government to replace the city commission government then in place in Pasadena and first used in 1901 in nearby Galveston. "We found it was hard to get good people to run for the city offices," he said. After two terms on the council, Barnhart ran unsuccessfully for mayor but was defeated by Clyde Doyle, a Democrat. In Texas, municipal offices are technically nonpartisan, and hence no party labels appear on the ballot. Barnhart recalls that a half dozen Pasadena officials were indicted in the late 1950s and early 1960s for public corruption.
In 1972, Barnhart was elected to a two-year term in revised District 100 (previously District 24-6) in the state House of Representatives, when President Richard M. Nixon and U.S. Senator John G. Tower were heading the state Republican ticket, along with the defeated gubernatorial nominee Henry Grover of Houston. Barnhart's House colleagues included Ray Hutchison of Dallas and Kay Bailey of Harris County. The two married during their common legislative tenure, and Kay Bailey Hutchison went on to the U.S. Senate in 1993. In the 1974 session, the legislature became an "ex officio" constitutional convention headed by Speaker Price Daniel, Jr., of Liberty, Texas. In the deliberations Barnhart opposed a motion to "guarantee equal educational opportunity and free public schools" to all citizens. As drafted, Barnhart said that the motion, offered by the University of Texas Board of Regents chairman Frank Erwin would have prevented the state from charging tuition and fees at its public colleges and universities. Legislators acting as delegates fell three votes short of the 121/188, or 2/3 supermajority needed to adopt the new constitution. The state is hence still governed by the Texas Constitution of 1876. In 1974, a strongly Democratic year nationally as well as in Texas, Barnhart was defeated for a second term in the legislature by the Democrat Bill Caraway. Barnhart recalls that certain members of the Sagemont Church, a mission of First Baptist Church of Houston organized in 1966 by founding pastor John D. Morgan, worked against Barnhart because of his conservative fiscal policies and succeeded in bringing about the freshman lawmaker's defeat. Barnhart added that the long-serving pastor John Morgan had no role in the political action.
National politics.
At the national level, Barnhart had supported Barry M. Goldwater's ill-fated campaign in Texas against native son Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1975–1976, as chairman of the Harris County Republican Party, Barnhart was asked by Reagan to manage the Californian’s presidential primary campaign in Texas. Barnhart, then a United Methodist, enlisted as co-chairmen Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland and a Roman Catholic, and Barbara Staff, a party leader in Dallas then active in the First Baptist Church under pastor W.A. Criswell. The campaign was so successful that the Reagan forces prevailed, 96-0, over President Ford, who had the backing of Senator John Tower. Then four more Reagan delegates were chosen at the state convention. Barnhart recalled that wealthy Texas contributors were loyal to President Ford, but the Reagan forces had the "plain people" as voters and election workers. Barnhart said that he offered Tower and John B. Connally, Jr., the former Democratic governor who switched parties in 1973 after having served as United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon, delegate positions at the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, provided they would agree to support Reagan for the first three potential ballots. The two declined Barnhart's offer and were hence not delegates to Kansas City. Barnhart was chairman of the Texas delegation at the convention.
Barnhart himself was a Reagan delegate in Congressional District 22, then including Fort Bend, Brazoria, and parts of Harris and Waller counties. His side prevailed, 15,054 to 7,934 for the Ford forces.
Supporting Bill Clements.
From 1975 to 1977, Barnhart was the Harris County Republican chairman. He was then state Republican chairman from 1977 to 1979, having succeeded Ray Hutchison, who stepped down to run unsuccessfully for governor in the primary against William P. Clements, Jr. Barnhart then worked to elect Clements, who secured a narrow gubernatorial victory over the Democrat John Luke Hill, the Texas attorney general and former chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court. As state GOP chairman, Barnhart was succeeded by Chester R. Upham, Jr. (1925–2008), an oil and natural gas businessman from Mineral Wells, Texas, who held the position until 1983.
In May 1979, incoming Governor Clements appointed Barnhart to the then three- member (since five members) Texas Department of Transportation. He served on the Texas Turnpike Authority, the state agency responsible for construction and operation of major toll facilities. At that time, Barnhart left his position with the Barmore Insurance Agency in Pasadena.
Federal Highway Administration.
Barnhart served for nearly two years under Clements in the Texas DOT until Reagan offered him the FHWA directorship in Washington, D.C. There Barnhart was known for his leadership, easy-going manner, and communication skills. In 1982, he fought to increase highway user fees for the first time in twenty-three years. He streamlined procedures, shortened delays, upheld the soundness of the Highway Trust Fund, and returned management authority to the states. Barnhart also worked to establish forty-two technology transfer centers at American colleges and universities and restructured and strengthened the motor carrier and international highway programs. In his first meeting with Congress on February 25, 1981, Barnhart vowed to present the "best professional judgments of the experts in my administration, tempered, of course, by the economic restraints which must be applied to all of government."
In 2004, Barnhart was inducted into the Texas Transportation Institute Hall of Fame. On leaving the FHWA, he had been recognized by the United States House of Representatives for his "honest, effective and meaningful efforts to preserve and improve the Federal-Aid System – one of the nation's most vital assets."
Years after leaving the position, Barnhart described the FHWA during his tenure as "a strictly professional, competent, caring agency." His resignation from the FHWA, which involved the supervision of 3,400 employees, took effect on December 31, 1987. Barnhart was briefly considered for the position of United States Secretary of Transportation to succeed Elizabeth Dole. However, the appointment went instead to James H. Burnley, IV, of North Carolina.
Barnhart claims that the FHWA lost its professionalism and became "politically oriented" during the administration of President Bill Clinton, whom Barnhart opposed in 1992 and 1996 when he supported George Herbert Walker Bush and Robert J. Dole for the presidency. Similarly, Barnhart said that Governor Ann W. Richards, Clements' second successor, "wiped out the career people and put in political appointees" at the Texas DOT.
Barnhart's seven-year tenure as FHWA director is still an agency record for longevity. Under the "New Federalism" proposals offered in 1982, Reagan sought to return many federal highway and mass transit programs to the states except for the interstate highway system. However, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act continued strong federal involvement in both highways and mass transit. Because of infrastructure needs, the law increased the gasoline tax by a nickel, the first such increase since 1959.
On January 6, 1983, Reagan signed the Surface Transportation Assistance Act so that the United States could improve its paving and bridge commitments by the middle of the decade. The legislation devoted one cent (later doubled) of each nickel to establish a transit account in the Highway Trust Fund.
Despite the need for highway improvements and increasing fuel prices of recent years, Texas has not raised its 20-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax since the early 1990s, and the diesel tax has been unchanged even longer. In 2008, Barnhart said that only twenty-three states had increased the fuel tax. In a letter to Democratic State Senator Kirk Watson of Austin, Barnhart said that the legislature, not the Texas Department of Transportation, is responsible for problems involving highways. "If the legislature had acted when I warned them fifteen years ago, Texas highway problems wouldn't be as critical as they are today. They didn't have the guts to deal with the big truck lobby," Barnhart said in an interview. Barnhart said that 18 wheelers and other large trucks place excessive strain on state highways, but the legislature has not increased the diesel tax to maintain the transportation network. A $5 billion bond package Texas voters approved in November [2007 won't be enough to alleviate some of those problems because the state needs much more than that amount just to maintain its highway system.
Former State Representative Carl Isett, a Republican from Lubbock, said that Barnhart made some valid points in his assessment but is too prone to blame the legislators for financial woes of TxDOT: “It's a combination of those factors. We have not given them everything they wanted but we have given them a lot. We try to fund more money for roads but a lot of that money comes from the feds.” Isett said that critics blame the legislature "every time something goes wrong.”
Later life.
During his FHWA tenure, the Barnharts resided in Falls Church, Virginia. The couple has two daughters, Whitney Allison Barnhart (born 1948), formerly Whitney Ziegler, of Shadyside in Belmont County, Ohio, and Mallory Ann Barnhart Rousellot (born 1955) and husband, Mark W. Rousellot (born 1954), ranchers from Sonora, Texas. Mallory Rousellot owns a restaurant in Sonora known as Mercantile on Main, located at the foot of the hill on which sits the Sutton County Courthouse. Mallory Rousellot is a former board member of the Sonora Independent School District and is chairman of the Sutton County Republican Party. The Barnharts relocated to Mrs. Barnhart's home county and reside in St. Clairsville within the Wheeling, West Virginia Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Barnhart had serious health problems in later years and underwent various medical treatments in Wheeling.
Barnhart died on 26 May 2013. At his request there was no funeral. He was interred privately in a family tomb on the Rousselot Ranch in Sonora, Texas.

Adenosquamous lung carcinoma

Adenosquamous lung carcinoma (AdSqLC) is a biphasic malignant tumor arising from lung tissue that is composed of at least 10% by volume each of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and adenocarcinoma (AdC) cells.
Classification.
Lung cancers have been historically classified using two major paradigms. Histological classification systems group lung cancers according to the appearance of the cells and surrounding tissues when they are viewed under a microscope. Clinical classification systems divide lung cancers into groups based on medical criteria, particularly their response to different treatment regimens.
Before the mid-1900s, lung cancer was considered to be a single disease entity, with all forms treated similarly. In the 1960s, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) was recognized as a unique form of lung cancer, based both on its appearance (histology) and its clinical properties, including much greater susceptibility to chemotherapy and radiation, more rapid growth rate, and its propensity to metastasize widely early on in its course. Since then, most oncologists have based patient treatment decisions on a dichotomous division of lung cancers into SCLC and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), with the former being treated primarily with chemoradiation, and the latter with surgery.
An explosion of new knowledge, accumulated mainly over the last 20 years, has proved that lung cancers should be considered an extremely heterogeneous family of neoplasms with widely varying genetic, biological, and clinical characteristics, particularly their responsiveness to the large number of newer treatment protocols. Well over 50 different histological variants are now recognized under the 2004 revision of the World Health Organization ("WHO-2004") typing system, currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme. Recent studies have shown beyond doubt that the old clinical classification paradigm of "SCLC vs. NSCLC" is now obsolete, and that correct "subclassification" of lung cancer cases is necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management.
Approximately 98% of lung cancers are carcinoma, which are tumors composed of cells with epithelial characteristics. LCLC's are one of 8 major groups of lung carcinomas recognized in WHO-2004:

Palos Verdes Golf Club

Palos Verdes Golf Club is private golf and social club located in Palos Verdes Estates, CA.
History.
The golf course began construction beginning in 1923, and was completed in 1924. The club, an amenity for property-owners in the newly developed Palos Verdes Project was designed by the prominent golf course architect George C. Thomas, Jr. (with help from William "Billy" Bell), who went on to design Riviera Country Club, Bel Air Country Club, and Los Angeles Country Club (North). The course was opened for play on November 15, 1924. Many varieties of trees were planted during original construction, which are now very mature and line and narrow the fairways. The land on which the course is situated is owned by the City of Palos Verdes Estates, and the club is operated under a concession agreement with the City.
The clubhouse underwent a major remodel from 2005-2007, making it a popular venue for weddings with the expansive ocean views and variable capacity.
General information.
The greens are a mixture of poa annua and bent grass, and the fairways are kikuyu grass. The course has much change in elevation, and can be difficult for some players to walk. Guests may play the course with a member, or may pay a public rate of $275 with highly restricted non-member tee times available. For the dress code, denim is not allowed; a tucked-in collared shirt, belt, and slacks or Bermuda shorts are required, as are soft spikes. The course sits on 214 acres of land, within an 800 acre parkland preserve, encompassing several connecting canyons and unmanicured forestland.
Membership is generally restricted to residential property owners in the city of Palos Verdes Estates, CA. Membership is open to residents of neighboring cities only by sponsorship from an existing member, and when no residents are on the waiting list. Nonresidents of Palos Verdes Estates additionally pay a higher entrance fee. Over the last few years, the waiting list for membership has shortened, allowing residents to join quickly and nonresidents to join within one year.
The club is the site of the annual Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge - an invitational tournament for the top NCAA Women's Golf teams in the country.
The course.
The course is a par 71, at a length of 6,528 from the black tees, 6,219 from the blue tees, 5,718 yards from the white tees, and 5,459 yards from the red tees. The men's slope ratings are 72.3/134, 70.8/129 and 68.5/124 for the black, blue, and white tees, respectively. 
While not considered lengthy at just over 6,500 yards, the architects' use of the natural terrain, barrancas, creeks, and hills, combined with small greens, extensive bunkering, narrow fairways with strategically designed landing areas, and prevailing westerly ocean breezes, the course presents a challenge for players of all levels. Members have taken great care in preserving the original design and routing of this masterpiece. As of July 2013, the course underwent a fresh $1.5M renovation, restoring some of the lost hole design features and removing hundreds of trees to open up ocean views, and adding modern chipping areas around most greens.
A number of the holes (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 13, 14) play longer than advertised, as they play into the prevailing west wind from the Pacific Ocean which is less than one mile from the course. Fourteen of the course's eighteen holes feature panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean (a Thomas trademark).
The front nine is a "perfect nine" - where no two holes in a row are of the same par.

Illinois chorus frog

The Illinois chorus frog, Pseudacris illinoensis, is a species of chorus frog that lives in scattered, restricted habitat ecosystems in the states of Arkansas, Illinois, and Missouri. It was published by Smith in 1951. Its lifecycle is little known, its isolated populations are increasingly restricted by agricultural drainage, and it is listed as a threatened subspecies. It is often referred to as a subspecies of "P. streckeri". Collins recognized it as its own species which was followed by ASW6.0 and Amphibiaweb on the basis of its diagnosability from Pseudacris streckeri and its allopatry. The IUCNredlist 2013.2 has not incorporated this taxonomic split.
Description.
The Illinois chorus frog, a wetland amphibian, grows to a maximum length of 1.5 inches (3.7 cm). Its range is restricted to isolated sandy wetlands along the banks of the Mississippi River and a major tributary, the Illinois River.
Its lifecycle begins with the mating season beginning in late February and continuing until late April, when the small amphibian signals its aptitude with a version of the distinctive cry that gives its genus its name. The breeding call can be heard at a distance of up to 1 mile (1.6 km). The pools of spring meltwater, where they live and eat, begin to dry up as early as mid-May, and the frogs disappear into hibernation below the winter frost line. Herpetologists say that the subspecies' unique anatomy makes its members ideal candidates for a life cycle that centers on hibernation. With unusually strong forelegs for its size, the Illinois chorus frog is described as the only frog that uses a breast stroke motion to dig its sandy burrows.
Threats.
The Illinois chorus frogs' preferred habitat in Arkansas includes the patch of sandy wetland soil surrounding Stuttgart, Arkansas where rice is grown. However, the invention of laser land-levelling, and its use by rice paddy operators, has eliminated 61% of the subspecies' range in this southern state.
Current events.
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources carried out a field study of the Illinois chorus frog's habitat in Mason County, Illinois, in March 2011. The study hoped to develop a methodological protocol to monitor the Illinois chorus frog's threatened population.

Bhumibol Dam

The Bhumibol Dam ("formerly known as the" Yanhi Dam) is a concrete arch dam on the Ping River, a tributary of the Chao Phraya River, in Amphoe Sam Ngao district of Tak Province, Thailand. It is located about north of Bangkok and was built for the purposes of water storage, hydroelectric power production, flood control, fisheries and saltwater intrusion management. The dam was named after King Bhumibol Adulyadej and was Thailand's first multi-purpose project.
Background.
The Bhumibol Dam among others in the Chao Phraya basin were constructed beginning in the 1950s to exploit the agricultural and hydroelectric potential of the basin. Construction on the dam began in 1958 and was finished in 1964 while the reservoir was completely filled in 1970. The first two generators were commissioned in 1964. In 1972, the Sirikit Dam was completed on the Nan River, one of two major tributaries of the Chao Phraya including the Ping. The Bhumibol and Sirkit Dams control 22% of the Chao Phraya's annual runoff combined. Both dams also help provide for the irrigation of in the wet season and in the dry season. The dam's power house underwent extensive upgrades and renovations in the 1990s. In 1991, the Lower Mae Ping Dam () was constructed downstream to create a lower reservoir for the one pumped-storage turbine that was installed. When constructed, the Bhumibol Dam contributed 22% of Thailand's power generation and in 2003 that number was 2%.
During the 2011 Thailand floods, rainfall for March 2011 over the area of northern Thailand was an extraordinary 344% above normal. Bhumibol Dam in particular got 242.8 mm of rain, 224.7 mm above the mean of 25.2 mm; and since 1 January had accumulated 245.9 mm, 216.0 mm or 186% above normal.
Design.
The dam is an arch-gravity type and is tall, long and wide at its crest. It withholds a reservoir of of which is active or "useful" storage. The dam's catchment area is 
while its surface area is . Its power plant contains eight different turbines for an installed capacity of 749 MW. Of the eight, six are 76.5 MW Francis-type, one is a 115 MW Pelton turbine and one is a 175 MW Francis pump-turbine. The Lower Mae Ping Dam is high, long and has a storage capacity of . In off-peak hours, the one pump-turbine returns water back into the Bhumibol (upper) reservoir and when demand is high, the pump serves as a generator for power production.

In season 8, she was eliminated in the first Live Show. Later on, she was asked to come back because RTL chief Tom Sänger (not the voters!) had eliminated Nina Richel from the show, allegedly for "health reasons".
Pietro Lombardi's brother posted a semi-nude picture of Engels after she had used Pietro's mobile phone to talk to girls. After hearing about what Sarah had done, Lombardi's brother Marco, who wasn't too happy about her actions, decided to take "revenge" by sharing this semi-nude picture of Engels. According to him, "Everyone knows how cheap Sarah Engels is. (She) is sneaky, a lying horse-faced ghit."

Monty the meerkat

Monty the meerkat is a meerkat that made headlines in the mainstream British media in September 2007 for his purported ability to take pictures using a digital camera. The story turned out to be a hoax perpetrated by workers at Longleat Safari Park.
Story.
As reported in "The Times", Ian Turner, the deputy head warden at the Longleat Safari Park, was photographing meerkats in their enclosure. The pictures were needed to illustrate a new informational brochure about the park. Realizing that he would be better off with a different camera, Turner went out to get one, leaving behind the first camera on a tripod.
When the warden returned, he was surprised to find that the camera he left behind had three more images on its memory card, images that he had not taken. Seeing no-one there but playful meerkats, the astonished photographer decided that the images were taken by a meerkat. After reviewing them, Turner realized that Monty—the head of the mob (group of meerkats)—was not pictured in any of them, from which Turner deduced that Monty must have taken the pictures. 
Coverage.
"The Times" wrote that Monty claimed the tripod and "soon discovered how to fire the shutter". It compared the images taken by Monty to the "first snaps taken by human beings", and found the images taken by Monty to be of a better quality. Monty cut off the head of his subject in one frame, but otherwise took a good, albeit slightly out of focus, family portraits of the member of his mob.
The story in "The Guardian", which described the meerkats as "turning paparazzi", discussed anthropomorphism and the dangers of training animals to act like humans. It joked that although photographers are sometimes insultingly called "monkeys", until now "cheeky reporters have never had the courage to suggest a meerkat could do a snapper's job."
"The Sun"'s story added new details of the incident. According to its coverage, some excited visitors of the Game Park actually saw meerkats taking "turns at peering through the viewfinder as if preparing to take a photo". "The Sun" interviewed an alleged eyewitness, who said: "Meerkats are playful and inquisitive creatures. They had a great time ? and so did we. It was very funny." 
"The Daily Telegraph" also covered the story, and compared the images taken by Monty to those taken by photographer David Bailey. Although "The Daily Telegraph" admitted that the images taken by meerkats were "perhaps not up to standards of David Bailey", it stated they were still "a remarkable achievement for the desert-dwelling creatures, who are arguably most famous for their proclivity for infanticide."
The "Daily Mail" used the opportunity to educate its readers on the behavior of wild meerkats, providing some links to the "interview with the producers of "Meerkat Manor"" – a documentary that was featured on the American television channel Animal Planet. In a photo montage titled ""Smile! You're on meerkat camera – warden's shock as cheeky creatures shoot their own family album"" "Daily Mail" tried to make its readers to comprehend a "new meaning of wildlife photography" – wild meerkats taking images of wild meerkats.
The "Daily Mirror" stated that not only did meerkats enjoy photography, but "hey also love to wrestle, race and are even said to take part in singing ceremonies similar to yodelling." 
Although a few newspapers provided a quote by Ian Turner the warden about meerkats getting "their nose and paws into most things", none of them specified which part of their bodies meerkats used to take the images: their noses or their paws, or both.
Hoax.
Though most of the British press took the story at face value, a technician from "Amateur Photographer" stated it was "puzzling" that although reports claimed the images taken by the meerkats were stored on a "digital memory card", the camera used for it was reported as a Canon EOS 650, 1987 film-based single lens reflex camera. "Amateur Photographer" requested clarification from the park officials, and the hoax was soon revealed.
Keith Harris, the head warden at the park, "told AP's news editor Chris Cheesman: 'It started off as a joke. It was a slight hoax. The meerkats didn't take any pictures at all'", and that "it wasn't meant to be picked up by newspapers in this way". The original idea for the ruse occurred after park employees noticed the meerkats playing with the camera equipment.
Roy Greenslade of "The Guardian" stated that he loved "that phrase – a "slight" hoax". On the other hand he found a few kind words to comfort "newspaper photographers": "The revelation of the hoax will certainly be a relief to newspaper photographers, who suffer from the indignity of being called 'monkeys' by reporters. If this had been a true story it would have confirmed the prejudices of their critics."
MSN described the whole story as one of the twelve "Hoaxes of the decade".

Iran–South Korea relations

Iran–South Korea relations are diplomatic relations between Iran and South Korea. Throughout history, the two countries have maintained a relatively friendly and strongly strategic partnership despite Iran's close relationship with North Korea, and South Korea's close relationship with the United States.
Despite the fact that South Korea is one of Iran's major commercial partners, according to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, only 8% of South Koreans view Iran's influence positively, with 73% expressing a negative view.
Nuclear program.
In June 2007, South Korea’s then-foreign minister, Song Min-soon, supported a diplomatic solution to the international disagreement over Iran’s nuclear program. In November 2008, South Korea’s next foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, said that Iran needs to reassure the international community of the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. According to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, a South Korean, "the Iranian foreign minister stressed that his country is pushing for a nuclear program for peaceful purposes.”
Economic relationship.
Iran and South Korea enjoy strong economic ties with bilateral trade totaling roughly $10 billion in 2008. Despite disagreements over Iran’s nuclear enrichment activity, Vice President of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency Hong Ki-Wha and the head of Iran’s Investment and Technical and Economic Assistances Organization, Mohammad Khaza’i, signed a memorandum of understanding in April 2007, in which they agreed to form a committee with the aim of boosting trade between their two countries. Kim Sung Gun, South Korea’s parliamentary delegation head to Iran in March 2007 noted that Korean companies are eager to invest in Iran and added that he hopes the two countries can encourage bilateral investment.
According to a Middle East Economic Survey, Iran exported 157,000 barrels of crude oil per day to South Korea in July 2009. Though South Korea has decreased total crude oil imports from the Middle East by 14.7% compared to the previous year, Iran remains South Korea’s fourth largest source of crude oil.
In May 2009, South Korean ministers participated in a major conference on foreign investment in Iran. South Korea also attended the Iranian gas forum on September 26–27, 2009 alongside Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, and Malaysia.
According to a report by the United States government, as of April 2010 there were three South Korean firms active in Iran’s hydrocarbon sector between 2005 and 2009 that received US government contracts totaling roughly $880 million. These were the Daelim Industrial Company, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and GS Engineering and Construction. On July 3, 2010, Iran the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) cancelled a $1.2 billion contract with GS Engineering and Construction, accusing the firm of failing to fulfill its obligations. The South Korean company had been tasked with removing hydrogen sulfide from gas pumped from Iran’s South Pars gas field after signing an agreement in October 2009.
Iran has about local 2,500 SME trading partners in South Korea. It said that more than 600 out of the 2,500 firms see their ratio of exports to Iran exceed 50 percent.
Diplomatic/military cooperation.
South Korea and Iran have continuously disagreed on the latter’s nuclear enrichment activities. In January 2007, Ban Ki-Moon, South Korea’s former foreign minister, assumed the position of UN Secretary General. Since assuming office, Ban has supported a number of sanctions against the Islamic Republic for failing to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency, further straining relations between the two countries. Impediments notwithstanding, South Korea and Iran have had a number of official meetings to discuss bilateral trade and political cooperation and have signed several memorandums of understanding, including on media cooperation, trade-investment, and technical cooperation between the two.
During a March 2009 meeting between National Assembly Speaker of South Korea Kim Hyong-o and Iranian Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi, Kim expressed his hope that Iran and South Korea expand parliamentary cooperation. That same month, the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister in Asia and Pacific Affairs suggested that Iran and South Korea should cooperate to help establish security in Afghanistan.
In November 2009, Iran announced that it was prepared to aid in resolving the Korean peninsula crisis. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said that Iran welcomes mutual understanding and agreement between South and North Korea to promote peace and stability in the region. During a meeting with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Yong-Jon at the end of October 2009, Mottaki said that “mutual cooperation has not been balanced in all fields and we hope to be able to make it more balanced.” The South Korean senior diplomat responded that “we want promotion of ties in all economic fields and implementing joint projects and deepening bilateral cooperation in direction of mutual interests.”
On January 6, 2010, the head of the Iran-South Korea parliamentary friendship group, Hossein Hashemi, and Speaker Kim Hyong-o met in Seoul in order to discuss ways to foster bilateral cooperation, particularly, in the economic and energy sectors. During the meeting, Hyong-o referred to the ample potentials existing on both sides for increasing mutual cooperation and expressed satisfaction over the growth of bilateral ties between the two countries. On Iran's nuclear issue, he stressed Iran's right to use peaceful nuclear energy, and added "all countries are entitled to use peaceful nuclear energy and we believe Iran's nuclear program is for civilian purposes."
In April 2010, in an effort to improve the two countries’ “mutual understanding and acquaintance,” South Korea and Iran agreed to exchange news and media teams and enhance current levels of educational and technical collaboration. The decision to expand cooperation in the field of media was taken following a meeting between Islamic Republic News Agency Directory Ali-Akbar Javanfekr and Lee Seung Jung, the head of the South Korea Press Association.
Although “high politics” ties between the two countries are not especially developed, Seoul and Tehran have taken steps to engage each other in cultural spheres. In May 2009, the South Korean Vice-Cultural Minister Jae-min Shin and the South Korean Ambassador to Tehran Kim Young-mok attended a ceremony entitled “Korea, Sparkling Night in Iran” where both officials expressed the hope that such events would bring about improved political, economic and cultural relations between South Korea and Iran. In October 2009, South Korea’s Pusan International Film festival will host two Iranian filmmakers, Payman Hagani and Mahmoud Kalari. The Iranian filmmakers will present their films as well as participate in an educational workshop for aspiring Asian directors. Furthermore, the Iran National Library and Archives (INLA) has agreed to work to increase bilateral cooperation with the National Library of Korea. In March 2010, INLA Director Ali-Akbar Ashari met with his South Korean counterpart, Chul-min Mo, to signed an agreement pledging to exchange experience in staff training and library science, and to hold book fairs.

<doc id="31095542" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31095542" title="Brighton Parks Police">
Brighton Parks Police

Brighton Parks Police was a park police force maintained by Brighton Borough Council for the borough of Brighton, England.
History.
The first suggestion of a park police forces was by the local chief constable in 1961. He stated that a dedicated park police force would allow the public to use the parks "...freely and safely, without fear of molestation and without there being undue rowdyism or improper conduct."
In 1962, the uniformed park keepers were reorganised into a single section under a Park Keeper Supervisor, and in 1963 were renamed "Park Police". A number of park keepers had already appointed as constables, by virtue of the Brighton Corporation Act 1931, but following the formation of the unified service all additional staff were also attested. In 1963, the force consisted of one Supervisor, one Assistant Supervisor and 14 Park Constables. Two constables were made redundant in 1981, and in 1984 the Parks Police underwent review.
The 1984 report found that 10 constables, organised in eight sections of one or two men, were responsible for 2,500 acres of open space, and the constables based at East Brighton and Hollingbury Park were responsible for the parks in the outlying areas of the borough. The two other constables provided relief cover for sickness and rest days. The Assistant Supervisor also provided some early morning cover and out-of-hours response. The force operated three vans, and had access to a Land Rover if required. Constables worked a 37-hour, 5-day week, year-round from dawn till dusk, and took rest days during the week so that as many as possible were available at weekends, when the parks were busiest. Some personal radios were used, but no formal training was provided, though the majority of constables came from police or security backgrounds.
The 1931 Brighton Corporation Act expired in 1986. The recommendation of the 1984 review was that section 77 of the Public Health Amendment Act 1907 should be used to attest staff as constables, though the powers it would have provided are unclear. However, cost-cutting in the 1990s caused the Parks Police to be disbanded. Some officers took early retirement, and others transferred to become "Urban Rangers".
Uniform.
Officers wore a uniform in the style of the contemporary police uniform, consisting of a dark blue tunic with chrome buttons (in later years a dark blue jersey was introduced), blue shirt, black tie and peaked cap. The uniform was supplied by the council transport department and was similar to that issued to bus inspectors, but with woven shoulder patches with the words "Park Police". Sillitoe Tartan, which was introduced to most territorial police forces in the late 1970s, was not used in the Parks Police. The cap badge was that issued to all uniformed staff of the borough council.

Neba'a Faour

Neba'a Faour, Tell Neba'a Faour, Mashna'et el Faour, Neba Faour or Nebaa Faour is a large, low lying archaeological tell mound in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon inhabited in the late 7th and early 6th millennium BC. It was initially discovered by Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe in 1965 near the road from Beirut to Damascus, 5 miles from the border with Syria. The site was mainly composed of soil and pebbles on limestone bedrock, the site showed heavy erosion since it was abandoned and recent damage from modern construction in the area. It has been suggested as an example of an aceramic stage following the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) that is called the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (PPNC); sites of comparable culture are Tell Ramad, Labwe and others in the Byblos region. It is generally dated between the second half of the 7th millennium and the beginning of the 6th millennium BC.
Materials recovered.
Most of the material recovered from this open cast site came from surface finds along with a to core of Neolithic deposits. Neolithic levels revealed evidence of stone-wall footings and a series of distinctive cream, lime-plaster floors. Black, beige or brown flint was knapped at the site, and tools recovered included numerous scrapers, cores for blades, Byblos- and Amouq-point arrowheads, javelins, sickle blade elements, burins and borers. Lebanese sites of this date usually reveal heavy tools, but only two hand axes were recovered at this site. A stone bowl with a fine bead rim was also found.
The site is notable for finds of a type of precursor to clay pottery called "White Ware", or "Vaiselle Blanche". This was made with a type of lime plaster mixed with grey ashes, which when fired it turned into a hardened, white material that resembles limestone. Vessels were formed by coiling the plaster around baskets. Fragments of large vessels were found that are thought to have been used like "portable silos".

Chuck Versus the Muuurder

"Chuck Versus the Muuurder" is the nineteenth episode of the fourth season of "Chuck". It originally aired on March 21, 2011. Chuck Bartowski is made the team leader and tasked with finding new Intersect candidates, but must solve a murder mystery when his recruits start turning up dead. Meanwhile, the Buy More and Large Mart staffs engage in mascot battle. 
Plot.
Main plot.
General Diane Beckman tasks Chuck Bartowski to choose Intersect candidates who think and act similarly to him, as he is the only one who truly knows what it is like to be an Intersect. Chuck creates an extensive psychological profile based on his own personality and the CIA sends four appropriate candidates to the Buy More. First is Lewis (James Francis Ginty), a technical operations specialist and star hacker by age fourteen; due to a semester abroad, Lewis has adopted an English accent. Second is Josie (Karissa Vacker), a psychological warfare genius whose intuition makes her invaluable in interrogation. Third is Damien (Mousa Kraish), a Greek American agent whose "swarthy, bearded" appearance has led to him being embedded in one terror cell after another for the last ten years. Last to arrive is Brody "the Brodster" (Stephen Pollak), who is strikingly similar to Chuck. Chuck tasks John Casey with the candidates' physical testing, Sarah Walker with psychological evaluations, and Morgan Grimes with testing their "cultural knowledge". Chuck ultimately chooses Brody. As Chuck informs Brody with a text message, Brody discovers someone planting an explosive at the door of Castle. Brody confronts the person, only to be stabbed to death and dragged away.
After Chuck and Director Jane Bentley (Robin Givens) find Brody's body, Chuck begins to panic about his leadership abilities. Bentley and the Intersect candidates surrender their weapons to Casey, as Chuck has realized the murderer must be one of them. To determine who killed Brody, Chuck plans to review security tapes and interrogate everyone. However, Damien believes that he is being suspected because of his appearance and angrily leaves. As he opens the door to exit Castle, however, an explosive is triggered. Though he manages to shield himself with the door, Damien is injured, ruling him out as a murder suspect.
The explosive triggers three others, cutting the main power to Castle and locking everyone inside. Chuck and Sarah interrogate Bentley, who has the most motive of the group, still angry about the failure of the G.R.E.T.A. program in the previous episode. Further investigation reveals that the candidates each had the motive and means to commit the murder, as Josie is emotionally unstable due to a recent breakup with her longtime boyfriend, Damien is angry about being typecast as a terrorist, and Lewis was Chuck's second choice for the Intersect. After the interrogations, Chuck and Sarah have come no closer to finding the killer than before. Suddenly, Chuck notices a bomb planted under the seat the interrogatees were sitting in, and he and Sarah barely escape with their lives. They regroup with Bentley and the candidates, though Lewis, the only bomb specialist in the group, is curiously missing.
With Damien unconscious after taking shrapnel to the back, the rest of the group decides that Lewis is the murderer and splits up to capture and interrogate him. Chuck and Bentley hear someone crawling in the air ducts, but Casey finds a pig ("See" "Buy More") instead of Lewis. Chuck and Bentley proceed to the NCS-restricted Intersect room, which is bombproof and the safest place in Castle. When they see Lewis hidden on railing near the room's ceiling, Chuck and Bentley draw their guns and lower the railing. However, they find Lewis's body, with his throat slit.
Chuck, Casey, and Sarah to confront Bentley and Josie, the only remaining suspects, only to find them accusing each and holding each other at gunpoint. Chuck reviews the day's events in his mind and recalls finding a positive pregnancy test in Josie's bag, explaining her emotions. He then accuses Bentley of being the murderer, as she was absent during every murder. When he moves closer to Bentley, however, he whispers that the actual murderer is Damien. As they draw their guns, Damien rises from his cot and threatens to detonate a boombox full of explosives if they do not get him to a doctor. Had Brody not seen him planting the explosives, Damien would have escaped. When he was forced to murder Brody and "cover his tracks", Damien strategically detonated the explosive and shielded himself with the door. He also planted the bomb under the chair during his interrogation and used the distraction to hide Lewis's body. Just as Damien reveals that he came for Chuck, Bentley shoots him and retrieves the boombox. She runs to the Intersect room and uses a manual release to lock the boombox in with her and save everyone else. As the one-minute timer counts down, Chuck hacks the door's control panels to save Bentley and they evacuate. The explosion sends the Large Mart piglet flying into Chuck's arms.
General Beckman congratulates the team for solving the mystery and saving Castle from destruction, with a special commendation to Chuck saying he is a true leader. Chuck humbly accepts and extends the credit to his teammates. Beckman then decides that it is too dangerous to upload the Intersect into a new recruit, leaving Chuck as the only Intersect for the foreseeable future. Bentley is reassigned to Washington and she apologizes for underestimating Chuck, relieving Chuck that he no longer has a nemesis. Later, as the team relaxes at Chuck's apartment, Beckman calls to inform them that Vivian Volkoff hired Damien. Chuck is dismayed that he has a nemesis again.
Buy More.
Morgan learns from Big Mike that the Buy More is doing the same promotion as their competitor Large Mart. To promote the sale, Mike stands outside the store wearing a large "BM" on his chest in the Buy More colors, green and yellow. Suddenly, Large Mart employees drive up in a van and kidnap Mike. The Large Mart employees claim that the kidnapping was in retaliation for Buy More employees kidnapping Kevin Bacon. Morgan confronts Jeff Barnes and Lester Patel, who lead him to the closet where they have kept "Kevin Bacon", a pig revealed to be the Large Mart mascot.
Morgan meets with the Large Mart manager, Marvin (David H. Lawrence XVII), and several other employees to negotiate a trade. Marvin allows Morgan to call Big Mike, proving that he is alive and being fed. Morgan leads Marvin to the closet where Kevin Bacon was being kept, only to find the pig missing.
Morgan questions Jeff and Lester about the location of the pig, but to no avail. They finally reveal that they have hidden the pig in the air ducts, just as Casey finds him in Castle. Later, an explosion sends the piglet flying into Chuck's arms.
Just as Morgan rallies the Buy More staff to rescue Big Mike, the latter walks through the main door, having easily escaped his "nerd" guards. But their victory is short-lived, as Large Mart employees bring the BM costume to the front door and light it on fire. Chuck then enters the Buy More with the pig, quickly deducing everything that's happened.
The Orion laptop.
Ellie Bartowski-Woodcomb continues using the laptop left by her father Stephen J. Bartowski (Orion), having been given the laptop by Bentley in the previous episode. Ellie studies her father's research and praises his intelligence and creativity. Concerned about his wife's obsession, Devon Woodcomb asks if she should be digging through her father's work, to which Ellie simply replies, "What's the worst that can happen?". Devon calls Chuck, and they agree to keep Ellie out of the spy world. Chuck suggests replacing the computer's hard drive with a blank one, which would make Ellie believe it was simply broke.
Meanwhile, Bentley has taken extreme measures in salvaging her credibility by monitoring Ellie's activity on the laptop. Chuck confronts Bentley about interfering with his family, and discovers a surveillance video of Ellie. Bentley later comments that Ellie, is incredibly smart and that if anyone could figure out the Intersect it is her, though she cautions Chuck about taking Ellie into the spy world.
As Devon switches the hard drive with a blank one, Ellie arrives home, having realized the purpose of her father's research. Ellie reveals that Stephen was trying to upload knowledge into the brain without having to learn it. Devon still delivers the hard drive to Chuck; when he returns to Ellie, however, it is revealed that Ellie is still working on same research. Devon and Ellie have agreed to hide the truth from Chuck.
While Ellie is asleep, the laptop scans the room and identifies her, allocating her files and displaying the words "Agent X Files".
Production.
Series co-creator Chris Fedak revealed to EW.com, "We've always wanted to do a murder mystery, so we're working on an episode right now where something terrible happens to someone down in Castle and Chuck and Co. are given the Sherlockian job of figuring out who the murder is... So we're working on our own spy version of a chamber piece."
The use of Journey's song "Any Way You Want It" as Brody's ringtone alludes to the pilot episode, where Chuck had the same ringtone when receiving a call from Morgan.

Reception.
"Chuck Versus the Muuurder" received generally positive reviews from critics. "HitFix" writer Alan Sepinwall wrote that "the actual muuurder investigation of 'Chuck vs. the Muuurder' was the least interesting part of an episode that I enjoyed on the whole. It's such a familiar device that we know a lot of how it works, including the way that the first suspect or two simply can't have done it because we still have a lot of time to fill. The four Intersect candidates were all fairly cartoonish, even by 'Chuck' standards... and the Bentley character has suffered from one of the few real guest casting missteps this show has made in a while, so I didn't particularly care which of them did it, so long as most of them (with the ironic exception of our swarthy bearded killer) were off my screen for good by episode's end... Fortunately, the murder mystery had a secondary element to it in Chuck's need to prove himself as a leader, and that part of the story was very strong." Steve Heisler of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a C+. Though he criticized the lack of importance of the series' civilian characters (excluding Morgan) in the episode, he wrote that the episode was "decent fun." Heisler concluded, "'Muuurder' took on a lot, and to its credit managed to make some sense of it all, even if it did resort to cheap, repetitive BM humor (not that I'm above a good BM joke). It's just that, at the end of the day, nothing much happened."
Eric Goldman of "IGN" gave this episode a score of 9 out of 10, writing, "After an off episode last week, this was a much more enjoyable Chuck installment, that took a time-honored formula ('One of us is a murderer!') and ran with it in classic Chuck style... Some episodes do a better job with a Buy More subplot than others, but the one this week was pretty great... The way this plotline merged with Chuck's had a rather hysterical payoff. I loved seeing little Kevin Bacon running for his life and then being blasted forward by an explosion, in a classic action movie hero style."
The episode continued "Chuck"'s steady decline in viewership, drawing 4.23 million viewers, a series low at the time of the episode's airing.

Neopolarogram

The term neopolarogram refers to mathematical derivatives of polarograms or cyclic voltammograms that in effect deconvolute diffusion and electrochemical kinetics. This is achieved by analog or digital implementations of fractional calculus. The implementation of fractional derivative calculations by means of numerical methods is straight forward. The G1- (Grünwald–Letnikov derivative) and the RL0-algorithms (Riemann–Liouville integral) are recursive methods to implement a numerical calculation of fractional differintegrals. Yet differintegrals are faster to compute in discrete fourier space using FFT.
Applications.
The graphs below show the behaviour of fractional derivatives calculated by different algorithms for ferrocene in acetonitrile at 100mV/s, the reference electrode is 0.1M Ag+/Ag in acetonitrile (+0.04V vs. Fc).
1st derivative of the "Semiderivative" or 1.5th order derivative in voltammetry.
1.5th order derivative of a voltammogram hits the abscissa exactly at the point where the formal potential of the electrode reaction is found.
"Semiderivative" or numerical Grünberg-Letnikov derivative in voltammetry.
The G1 algorithm produces a numerical derivative that has the shape of a bell curve, this derivative obeys to certain laws, for example the G1 derivative of a cyclic voltammogram is mirrored at the abscissa as long as the electrochemical reaction is diffusion controlled, the planar diffusion approximation can be applied to the electrode geometry and ohmic drop distortion is minimal. The FWHM of the curve is approximately 100 mV for a system that behaves in the described manor. The maximum is found at the value of the formal potential, this is quivalent to the 1.5th order semiderivative hitting the abszissa at this potential. Moreover the semiderivative scales linearly with the scanrate, while the current scales linearly with the square root of the scanrate (Randles-Sevcik equation). Plotting the semiderivatives produced at different scanrates gives a family of curves that are linearly related by the scanrate quotient in an ideal system.
"Semiintegral" or numerical Riemann-Liouville integral in voltammetry.
The shape of the semiintegral can be used as an easy method to measure the amount of ohmic drop of an electrochemical cell in cyclic voltammetry. Essentially the semiintegral of a cyclic voltammogram at a planar electrode (an electrode that obeys to the rules of planar diffusion) has the shape of a sigmoid while the original data is gauss-sigmoid convoluted. This enables the operator to optimize parameters necessary for positive feedback compensation in an easy manor. If ohmic drop distortion is present the two sigmoids for the forward and the backward scan are far away from congruence, the ohmic drop can be calculated from the deviation from congruence in these cases. In the example shown slight distortion is present, yet this does not have adverse effects on data quality.
Merits of FFT techniques.
The implementation differintegral calculation using fast fourier transform has certain benefits because it is easily combined with low pass quadratic filtering methods. This is very useful when cyclic voltammograms are recorded in high resistivity solvents like tetrahydrofuran or toluene, where feedback oscillations are a frequent problem.

Cyanea rivularis

Cyanea rivularis (syn. "Delissea rivularis") is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name plateau cyanea. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Kauai. There are three small populations of the plant remaining in the wild, for a total of 19 individual plants. The plant was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1996.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a shrub growing 4 to 5 meters tall. It bears blue-striped white flowers. It grows in wet forest habitat, generally next to streams, waterfalls, and plunge pools. Other plants in the habitat include ōhia lehua ("Metrosideros polymorpha") and uluhe ("Dicranopteris linearis"), which dominate the canopy, and kanawao ("Broussaisia arguta"), ieie ("Freycinetia arborea") and aiea ("Ilex anomala") in the understory.
This ecosystem is threatened by exotic plant species such as Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta"), Kahili ginger ("Hedychium gardnerianum"), and Santa Barbara daisy ("Erigeron karvinskianus"). Feral ungulates damage the habitat, and rats and slugs damage plants.

Amy Shuard

Amy Shuard CBE (19 July 192418 April 1975) was an English operatic soprano renowned in such dramatic roles as Elektra, Turandot and Brünnhilde. She created both title roles in Janáček's "Káťa Kabanová" and "Jenůfa" in their respective British premieres. She has been described as "the best English dramatic soprano since Eva Turner" (her teacher). 
Biography.
Amy Shuard was born in London. After studying at the Trinity College of Music, she had lessons from Eva Turner. In 1948 the Worshipful Company of Musicians awarded her a prize and she toured South Africa as the organization's representative. She returned there in 1949 to make her operatic debut, in Johannesburg, in the title role of Verdi's "Aida"; during that season she also sang Giulietta in "The Tales of Hoffmann" and Venus in "Tannhäuser". 
She sang at Sadlers Wells from 1949 to 1953, before undertaking more study in Milan with Rosetta Pampanini, and then at Covent Garden from 1954 until her death. She also sang at Bayreuth, La Scala, Vienna, Buenos Aires and San Francisco.
Her notable roles included the title roles in "Káťa Kabanová" (in the 1951 United Kingdom premiere), "Jenůfa" (in the 1956 UK premiere), "Carmen", "Tosca", "Turandot", "Elektra", "Madama Butterfly" and "Aida"; as well as Santuzza in "Cavalleria rusticana", Eboli in "Don Carlos", Tatyana in "Eugene Onegin", Magda Sorel in "The Consul", Lady Macbeth (in the first production of Verdi's "Macbeth" at Covent Garden), and Kostelnička Buryjovka in "Jenůfa" in 1972 and 1974.
The latter part of the career saw her essay Wagnerian roles, and she was the first English soprano to sing Brünnhilde at Covent Garden. She also sang Isolde at Geneva, as well as Sieglinde and Kundry. 
San Francisco was the only place she appeared on stage in the United States, firstly as Brünnhilde in "Die Walküre" in October 1963, then in 1966 as Elektra, 1968 as Turandot, and finally as Brünnhilde in "Götterdämmerung" in 1969.
Amy Shuard was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). She died in 1975, aged 50.

Can-Am Crown International Sled Dog Race

The Can-Am Crown is an international sled dog race held annually in Fort Kent, Maine, and usually takes place the first Saturday in March (which is also the day the Iditarod Trail begins). The organization was founded on October 16, 1992 as a non-profit corporation for the purpose of establishing a long-distance sled dog race.
History.
The first Can-Am Crown 250-mile race began on Tuesday, February 16, 1993. Nine teams from Maine, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick competed in that race. In 1994 sixteen teams competed in the 250-mile race and eleven in the newly introduced 60-mile race. In 1997 a 30-mile race was added to the itinerary. That same year, the first Saturday in March was established as the official start date for all three races. 
The directors set a limit of 30 teams in each race due to the popularity the races had gained. The limit was reached in 2005.
Race.
The race begins on Main Street in Fort Kent, sloping underneath the international bridge to Canada, then extending into the western parts of the Allagash wilderness, and finishes back in Fort Kent. Three races are part of the CAN-AM Crown, consisting of a 30 mile, 60 mile, and an Iditarod qualifying 250 mile race. Competitors travel from throughout the United States and Canada to compete in the sled dog race.
The 250-mile race course contains five checkpoints. All teams are required to sign in and sign out of each checkpoint. Normally the 30 and 60 mile race finish on the same day as they started, whereas the 250 mile race extends from 2–4 days. Mushers must reach the Allagash checkpoint by a specified date in order to complete the race.
Prizes.
The winner of the Can-Am 250 receives $29,000. The winner of the Can-Am 60 gets $7,000 and the winner of the Can-Am 30 receives $4,000. Minnesota musher Ryan Anderson won the 250 mile race in 2012, completing the trail in 31 hours, 22 minutes and 16 seconds.

Delissea subcordata

Delissea subcordata is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common names Koʻolau Range delissea and oha. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Oahu. It is now only found in the Waianae Mountains, and it is believed to be extirpated from the Koʻolau Range, where it once occurred. As of 2008 there were 40 individuals remaining, 28 of which were mature plants. This plant was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1996.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a shrub which grows up to 3 meters tall and bears white or greenish flowers. It grows in moist forest habitat. Other plants in the forests include ohia lehua ("Metrosideros polymorpha") and koa ("Acacia koa"), which dominate the canopy, and Ēlama ("Diospyros hillebrandii"), papala kepau ("Pisonia" spp.), and ʻĀlaʻa ("Pouteria sandwicensis") in the understory.
Threats to this rare species and its ecosystem include feral goats and pigs.

1st Battalion 107th Cavalry Regiment

The 1st Battalion 107th Cavalry Regiment was a unit of the Ohio Army National Guard, with troops in multiple locations throughout northeastern Ohio and has served proudly in the United States of America's major wars and conflicts since 1898 until its inactivation on 31 August 2007.
History.
The 107th Cavalry Regiment (minus 1st Squadron) reorganized on 1 May 1977 in the Ohio Army National Guard (Troop A, Support Squadron, was allotted on 1 October 1986 to the West Virginia Army National Guard and re-allotted on 15 October 1990 to the Ohio Army National Guard). It was placed on 1 June 1989 under the United States Army Regimental System consisting of the following units:
Headquarters and Headquarters Troop 107th ACR - Cleveland, OH;
1st Squadron 150th Cavalry Regiment (United States) - Bluefield, WV;
2nd Squadron 107th ACR - Akron, OH;
3rd Squadron 107th ACR - Stow, OH;
4th Squadron 107th ACR - Greensburg, OH;
Regimental Support Squadron - Medina, OH. 
The 107th ACR was reorganized and redesignated on 1 September 1993 as the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry Regiment, Headquarters in Stow, Ohio (formerly the 3/107th ACR) and assigned to the 28th Infantry Division. The 2nd Squadron, 107th Cavalry (United States) was assigned to the 37th Armor Brigade; On 1 September 1994 the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry and the 2nd Squadron, 107th Cavalry, were realigned and assigned to the 37th Armor Brigade, 38th Infantry Division. In September 2001 the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry Regiment was once again assigned to the 28th Infantry Division.
Coat of arms.
Shield: Or, on a bend Gules between a Roman Sword in sheath point to base and a prickly pear cactus both Vert, three alerions of the field.
Crest: That for the regiments and separate battalions of the Ohio Army National Guard: From a wreath Or and Gules, a sheaf of seventeen arrows Argent bound by a sprig of buckeye (aesculus glabra) fructed Proper (two leaves bursting burr).
Motto: "Facere Non Dicere" (To Act, Not To Speak).
Symbolism: The shield is yellow for cavalry. The bend charged with the alerions, taken from the arms of Lorraine, is representative of World War I service and is red to indicate that the 107th Cavalry served as field artillery during World War I. The Roman Sword in sheath is for Spanish–American War service and the cactus for Mexican Border duty.
Background: The coat of arms was originally approved for the 107th Cavalry Regiment, Ohio National Guard on 8 March 1927. It was amended to correct the wording of the blazon of the shield on 17 June 1927. It was redesignated for the 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment, Ohio National Guard on 15 January 1952. The insignia was amended to add the crest of the State of West Virginia on 22 March 1971. It was amended to delete the crest of the State of West Virginia on 3 April 1975. The coat of arms was redesignated effective 1 September 1993, for the 107th Cavalry Regiment.

Operation Iraqi Freedom.
In October 2003, B and C Companies, and elements of Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) and Company A, of the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry were activated at their home stations in Ohio and traveled to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Stewart, Georgia, for five months of mobilization training. There they were then attached to the 1st Battalion, 150th Armor (West Virginia Army National Guard), the 1st Battalion, 252nd Armor (North Carolina Army National Guard), and Troop E, 196th Cavalry (North Carolina Army National Guard) respectively, for deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom II with North Carolina's 30th Brigade Combat Team under the 1st Infantry Division. These elements of the 1st Battalion operated in Iraq from February to December 2004, serving in Kirkush, Tuz Khurmatu, Jalawla, and Baghdad. They participated in the Transition of Iraq and Iraqi Governance campaigns and returned home in late December, 2004.
The Battalion Commander LTC Richard T. Curry and CSM Albert Whatmough along with the remaining companies continued their regular training cycle until October 2004, when the remaining company's of the 1-107th Cavalry were activated for service in Operation Iraqi Freedom III. One element of HHC 1-107th CAV was then deployed to Fort Dix, New Jersey for mobilization training and left for Kuwait in January 2005. The companies operated in Baghdad, Iraq and performed detainee operations at Camps Cropper and Victory. The Headquarters was deployed to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin and arrived in Kuwait in December 2004 and deployed to Mosul, Iraq in late December, this element included LTC Richard T. Curry the 1-107th Cavalry Commander and CSM Albert Whatmough who both deployed with the battalion in 2004-2005 with the mission of establishing the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Endurance which later became known as FOB Q-West Base Complex 30 Kilometers south of Mosul, Iraq. The mission of LTC Curry and his staff was to provide command & control of the base, establish the Base Defense Operations Center, provide life support functions, establish base defense security, combat patrols and build the FOB from the ground up into the largest logistical hub operating in northern Iraq by the end of 2005, a mission that was accomplished prior to their departure.
The FOB Endurance/Q-West Base Complex HQ elements of the 1-107th CAV were attached to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and received the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for their accomplishments. The HHC/A Convoy Security Company conducted operations throughout Iraq logging in thousands of miles with no fatalities and provided excellent security for convoy elements. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry served within the 1st Cavalry Division, 4th Infantry Division, and 3rd Infantry Division areas of operations as units of the 18th and 42nd MP Brigades. The final elements returned home from Iraq in January 2006 reuniting the battalion. Both HHC/A detachments received the U.S. Army Meritorious Unit Commendation for their service.
Transformation and inactivation.
As the U.S. Army conducted its largest organizational transformation since World War II, the 1st Battalion 107th Cavalry Regiment, along with D Company from the 1st Battalion, 148th Infantry, as well as a company from the 112th Engineer Battalion, were chosen to form a new combined arms battalion within the 37th Brigade Combat Team, 38th Infantry Division. A change in designation was required and the unit uncased the new colors of the 1st Battalion, 145th Armored Regiment, effective 1 September 2007.

Monsoon of South Asia

A Monsoon of the Indian subcontinent is among several geographically distributed observations of global monsoon taking place in the Indian subcontinent. In the subcontinent, it is one of oldest weather observations, an economically important weather pattern over June through September every year, and the most anticipated weather event and unique weather phenomenon. Yet it is only partially understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed explaining the origin, the process, the strength, the variability, the distribution and the general vagaries of the monsoon of the Indian subcontinent, but understanding of the phenomenon and its predictability are still evolving. 
The unique geographical features of the subcontinent, along with associated atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical components, are influential in ensuring the anticipated behavior for a monsoon in South Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its effect on agriculture, flora and fauna and the general weather of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc., among other economic, social and environmental effects, a monsoon is one of the most anticipated, followed and studied weather phenomena of the Indian subcontinent. It has significant impact on the overall well-being of subcontinent residents and has even been dubbed the "real finance minister of India".
Definition.
"Monsoon", derived from the Arabic word "Mawsim" meaning "season", although generally defined as a system of winds characterized by a seasonal reversal of its direction, lacks a consistent detailed definition. Some examples are given below:
Monsoon of the subcontinent is primarily noted for its rain bearing ability and for the associated unpredictability of the weather. Consequently some definitions incorporate rain in its definition.
Background.
Observed initially by sailors in the Arabian sea traveling between Africa, India and South-East Asia, Monsoon is a major weather phenomenon in India (and the subcontinent) for the influence it casts on the lives of its inhabitants for centuries.
Monsoon in India can be categorized into "two branches" based on their spatial spread over the sub-continent:
Alternatively, it can be categorized into "two segments" based on the direction of rain bearing winds:
Based on the time of the year that these winds bring rain to India, they can also be categorised in "two rain periods" called:
The complexity of Monsoon as a weather phenomenon of India is not yet completely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict its behavior in terms of quantity, temporal and spatial distribution of the accompanying precipitation. These are the most monitored components of Monsoon determining the water availability in India for any given year.
Mechanism of Monsoon.
Monsoon is a tropical phenomenon. Indian subcontinent, lies northwards of the equator up to the Himalayas and Hindukush, primarily in the tropical zone of the Northern Hemisphere.
Weather pattern involves winds blowing from the south-west direction (known as South-West Monsoon) from the Indian Ocean onto the Indian landmass during the months of June through September. These are generally rain-bearing winds, blowing from sea to land, and bring rains to most parts of the subcontinent. They split into two branches, the "Arabian Sea Branch" and the "Bay of Bengal Branch" near the southernmost end of the Indian Peninsula. They are eagerly awaited in most parts of India for their agricultural and economic importance.
Subsequently later in the year, around October, these winds "reverse" direction and start blowing from a north-easterly direction. Given their land to sea flow, from subcontinent onto the Indian Ocean, the system with less moisture brings rain to only limited parts of India like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This is known as the North-East Monsoon. However, this rain is responsible for the rice bowls of South India.
This "mechanism" completes the "annual Monsoon cycle" of the Indian subcontinent.
Effect of Geographical relief features.
Although the SW and NE Monsoon winds are seasonally reversible, they do not cause precipitation on their own.
Two factors for rains are essential for rain formation:
Additionally, one of the causes of rain need to happen, which in this case is primarily Orographic due to presence of highlands right across the paths of the winds. Orographic barriers in the path of a wind force it to rise. Consequently, precipitation occurs on the windward side of highlands due to adiabatic cooling and condensation of the rising motion of the moist air.
For all the above scenarios to fulfill simultaneously, the unique geographic relief features of Indian subcontinent come into play. The notable features of Indian sub-continent, required in explanation of the Monsoon mechanism, are as follows:
Features of Monsoon Rains.
There are some unique features about the rains that Monsoon brings to the Indian subcontinent.
""Bursting"" of Monsoon Rains.
"Bursting of Monsoon" implies the onset of the sudden change in weather conditions in India (typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the SW Monsoon) due to abrupt rise in the "mean daily rainfall". Similarly the burst of NE monsoon marks an abrupt increase in the "mean daily rainfall" over the affected regions.
Monsoon Rain Variability (""Vagaries"").
One of the most commonly used phrases to describe the erratic nature of the Monsoon of the Indian subcontinent is "vagaries of monsoon", used in newspapers, magazines, books, web-portals to insurance plans and India's budget discussions.
In some years, it rains too much causing floods in several parts of India, in others it rains too little or not at all causing droughts. In some years when the rain quantity is sufficient, its timing may be arbitrary. In some years, in spite of "average annual rainfall", its daily distribution or the areal distribution might be substantially skewed. Such is the variability in the nature of Monsoon rains and weather.
Ideal and Normal Monsoon Rains.
Every year the normal onset of SW Monsoon is expected to ""burst"" onto the western coast of India (near Thiruvananthapuram) around 1 June covering entire India by around 15 July. Its withdrawal from India typically starts from 1 September onwards and completes by around 1 October.
Similarly the NE Monsoon is expected to ""burst"" around 20 October and last for a period of about 50 days before withdrawing.
However, a rainy Monsoon is not necessarily a "normal" Monsoon. A "normal Monsoon" is expected to perform close to its statistical averages calculated over a significantly long periods. Therefore, a "normal Monsoon" is generally accepted to be the Monsoon that has near "average quantity" of precipitation over all the geographical locations ("mean spatial distribution") under its influence and over the entire expected time period of its influence ("mean temporal distribution"). Additionally, the "arrival date" and the "departure date" of both the SW and NE Monsoon should be close to the "mean" dates. The exact criteria for "Normal Monsoon" is defined by the Indian Meteorological Department with calculations for the "mean" and "standard deviation" for each of the aforesaid precipitation variables. 
A Monsoon with excess rain can cause floods in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought, food shortage, famine and economic losses. Therefore, a "normal Monsoon" with "mean performance" is the most desirable Monsoon.
Theories for Mechanism of Monsoon.
Theories for mechanism of Monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timings of their reversal.
Traditional Theory.
Due to difference in the specific heat capacity of land and water, continents heat up faster than the seas. Consequently the air above the coastal lands heats up faster than air above seas. This creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared to the air pressure over the seas causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as sea breeze
Process of Monsoon creation.
Also known as the "thermal theory" or the "Differential Heating of Sea and Land Theory", it portrays the Monsoon as a large-scale sea breeze. It states that during the hot sub-tropical summers, the massive landmass of Indian Peninsula heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas resulting in a pressure gradient from South to North. This causes flow of moisture laden winds from sea to land. On reaching the land these winds rise up due to the geographical relief, cooling adiabatically and leading to orographic rains. This is the "southwest monsoon".
Reverse happens during winter when the landmass is colder than the sea establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over Indian landmass towards Indian Ocean in a north-easterly direction causing the "northeast monsoon".
Since the SW monsoon is from sea to land, it has more moisture (therefore causing more rain) than the NE monsoon. Only a part of the NE monsoon passing over Bay of Bengal picks up moisture causing rain in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu during the winter months.
However many meteorologists argue that the Monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory but a general weather phenomenon along the entire tropical zone of earth. This criticism, does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds but merely restricts it to one of the several factors rather than the only one.
Dynamic Theory.
The prevailing winds of the atmospheric circulation arise due to the difference in pressure at various latitudes of Earth and act as means for distribution of thermal energy on the planet. This pressure difference is due to the differences in Solar insolation received at different latitudes of Earth and the resulting uneven heating of the planet. Alternating belts of high-pressure and low-pressure develop along the equator, the two tropics, the Arctic and Antarctic circles and the two polar regions giving rise to the Trade winds, Westerlies and the Polar easterlies. However, the geophysical factors like revolution of earth, its rotation and axial tilt of the Earth result in gradual shifting of these belts northwards and southwards following the Sun's seasonal shifts.
Process of Monsoon creation.
The "dynamic theory of Monsoon" explains monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to it, Monsoon is the result of the shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) under the influence of the vertical sun. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator it keeps shifting northwards and southwards with the migration of the vertical sun towards the tropics (Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn) during the summer of the respective hemispheres (Northern and Southern Hemisphere). As such, the theory states that during the northern Summer (months of May and June), the ITCZ moves northwards, along with the vertical sun, towards the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ being the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the Trade winds of both the hemispheres. Consequentially, with ITCZ at the Tropic of cancer, the South East Trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach the ITCZ. However, due to Coriolis effect, (Coriolis effect causes winds in northern hemisphere to turn to its right whereas winds of southern hemisphere to turn to its left) these South East trade winds are deflected eastwards in the Northern Hemisphere transforming into South West trades. These pick up the moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the South-West Monsoon.
The "dynamic theory" provides the explanation of the system of Monsoon as a circum-global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the "Traditional Theory" (based on heating of Sea and Land) it enhances the explanation of the differential intensity of precipitation impact of Monsoon along the coastal regions with orographic barriers.
Jet Stream Theory.
This theory tries to explain the establishment of both the NE and SW Monsoons as well their unique features like "bursting" and variability.
The jet streams are a system of upper-air westerlies. It gives rise to slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250 knots winds in some air streams. First observed by World War II pilots, they develop just below the tropopause over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the "polar jets", the "subtropical westerly jets" and the less common "tropical easterly jets". They follow the principle of geostrophic winds.
Process of Monsoon creation.
Over India, a "subtropical westerly jet" develops in the winter season which is replaced by the "tropical easterly jet" in the summer season. The high temperature over the Tibetan Plateau, as well as over Central Asia in general, during the summer is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the "tropical easterly jet" over India in summer.
The mechanism affecting monsoon is that the "westerly jet" causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north to south flow of the winds in the form of the NE Monsoon. With the northwards shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts northwards too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated terrain features of high altitude of the plateau, etc. generate the "tropical easterly jet" over central India. This jet creates a low pressure zone over the northern Indian plains influencing the wind flow towards these plains, assisting the establishment of the SW Monsoon.
Theory for ""Bursting"" of Monsoon.
The unique feature of "bursting" of the Monsoon is primarily explained by the "Jet Stream theory" and the "Dynamic Theory".
Dynamic Theory.
According to this theory, during the summer months of Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts northwards pulling the SW Monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However the huge landmass of the Himalayas continue to restrict the low pressure zone onto the Himalayas itself. It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up a lot more than the Himalayas does the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shift northwards leading to "burst of Monsoon showers" over the Indian subcontinent.
The reverse shift takes place for the NE Monsoon winds leading to a second minor "burst" during the Northern Hemisphere winter Months of NE Monsoon rainfall over Eastern Indian peninsula.
Jet Stream Theory.
According to the theory the onset of SW Monsoon over Indian subcontinent is driven by the shift of the "subtropical westerly jet" northwards from over the plains of India towards the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the Plateau during the summer months. This shift of the "westerly jet" to the north of the Himalayas is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause of these is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up the low pressure created over it pulls the "westerly jet" northwards. Due to lofty Himalayas, the "westerly jet" is inhibited from moving northwards. However, with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the "westerly jet" across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt causing the "bursting of SW Monsoon rains" onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the NE Monsoon.
Theories for Monsoon Variability.
The Jet Stream effect.
The above mentioned Jet Stream theory also explains the variability in "timing" and "strength" of the Monsoon.
Timing: A timely northward shift of the "subtropical westerly jet" in the beginning of the summer season is critical to the onset of the SW Monsoon over India. If the northward shift of this jet is delayed, so is the SW Monsoon. An early shift heralds in an early Monsoon.
Strength: Additionally, the strength of the SW Monsoon is determined by the strength of the "easterly tropical jet" over central India. A strong "easterly tropical jet" results in a strong SW Monsoon over central India and vice-versa.
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect.
"El Niño" is a 'warm' ocean current originating along the coast of Peru that replaces the usual 'cold' Peru or Humboldt Current. This warm surface water reaching towards the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed westwards by the trade winds thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean. A reverse condition is known as La Niña.
Southern Oscillation, a phenomenon first observed by Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker Director-General of Observatories in India, refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. He noticed that when it was high pressure in Tahiti, it was low pressure in Darwin and . A "Southern Oscillation Index" (SOI),based on the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, has been formulated by the Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) to measure the strength of the Oscillation. Walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the Indian subcontinent was often negligible in the years of high pressure at Darwin (and low pressure at Tahiti). Conversely, low pressure at Darwin bode well for the precipitation quantity in India. Thus he established the relationship of Southern Oscillation with quantities of Monsoon rains in India.
Ultimately, it was realized that the Southern Oscillation is just the corresponding atmospheric component of the El Niño/La Niña effect (which happens in the Ocean). Therefore in the context of the Monsoon, the two cumulatively came to be known as the "ENSO".
The ENSO is known to have a pronounced effect on the strength of SW Monsoon over India with the Monsoon being weak (causing droughts in India) during the El Niño years whereas La Niña years had particularly good Monsoon strength over India.
Indian Ocean Dipole effect.
Although ENSO was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in the recent decades the ENSO-Monsoon relationship seemed to weaken in the Indian subcontinent. For e.g. the 1997, strong ENSO failed to cause drought in India. However, it was later discovered that just like ENSO was an event in he Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean was also at play. It was discovered in 1999 and named the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). An index to calculate it was also formulated. IOD develops in the equatorial region of Indian Ocean from April to May peaking in October. With a positive IOD winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west. This results in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean near African Coast) being much warmer and eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry. In the negative dipole year, reverse happens making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.
It was demonstrated that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years like the 1983, 1994 and 1997. Further, it was shown that the two poles of the IOD - the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) were independently and cumulatively affecting the quantity of rains for the Monsoon in the Indian subcontinent.
Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation.
Similar to ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and named as "Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO)". When EQUINOO effects were factored into the statistics certain failed forecasts, like the acute drought of year 2002, could be further accounted for. The relationship between extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, along with ENSO and EQUINOO have been studied and models for enhanced predictability of the quantity of monsoon rains have been statistically derived.
Monsoon Rain prediction models.
Since the Great Famine of 1876–78 in India, various attempts have been made to predict the rainfall during the Monsoons in India. At least five models for prediction of Monsoon rains exist in India.
Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM).
Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) at Bengaluru is facilitating the Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM) experiment on the PARAM Padma supercomputing system.
This project did simulated runs on historical data from 1985 to 2004 to try and establish the relationship between of five "atmospheric general circulation models" with the Monsoon rainfall distribution.
Indian Meteorological Department Model.
IMD has tried to forecast the Monsoon for India since 1884, some unsuccessfully but till 2011 is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity, distribution and timings of the Monsoon in India. IMD's position as the sole authority on the matter was further reiterated in 2005 by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi. In 2003, IMD underwent a substantial change in its forecast methodology, model as well as its administration. A sixteen parameter monsoon forecasting model used by the Indian met office since 1988 was revamped in 2003 with a new one. However, following the 2009 drought in India (worst since 1972), IMD decided in 2010 that it needed to develop an "indigenous model" to further enhance its prediction capabilities.
Significance.
Indian Monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for fresh water in the Indian subcontinent. As such it impacts the environment (and associated flora, fauna and ecosystems), agriculture, society, hydro-power production and geography of the subcontinent (like availability of fresh water in water bodies, underground water table) with all these factors cumulatively contributing towards the health of the economy of affected countries.
The Indian Monsoon turns large parts of India from a kind of semi-desert into green grasslands. See photos only taken 3 months apart in the Western Ghats.
Geographical (Wettest Spots on Earth).
Mawsynram and Cherrapunji, both in the Indian state of Meghalaya alternate to be the "wettest places on Earth" given the quantity of their rainfall. There are other cities with similar claims but with 10,000mm of rain for each of these locations, Monsoon of Indian subcontinent is a significant contributor towards the water supply of its area of influence.
Agricultural.
India, historically an agrarian economy primarily, has recently seen the services sector overtaking the farm sector in terms of GDP contribution. However, even today agriculture sector contributes 17-20% of GDP and is the largest employer in the country with about 60% of people dependent on it for employment and livelihood. The land use pattern of India indicates that 49% of land is under agriculture in India, it is 55% if associated wetlands agriculture, dryland farming areas, etc. are included. Since over half of these farmlands are rain-fed, Monsoon is critical to the food sufficiency and quality of life for the country.
Despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation, agricultural dependency on monsoon is far from insignificant, even today. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by Monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to conditions of floods or droughts causing the agricultural sector to adversely suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation and therefore the overall quality and cost of living for the general population in India.
Economic.
The economic significance of monsoon can be aptly summed up by Pranab Mukherjee's statement that monsoon is the "real finance minister of India".
A good monsoon resulting in improved agricultural brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces their imports overall reducing the food inflation. Further improved rains result in increased hydroelectric production.
All these factors initiate positive ripple effects throughout the economy of India.
Social.
D. Subbarao (Governor of Reserve Bank of India), during a quarterly review of the monetary policy, once highlighted that lives of Indians depends on the performance of Monsoon. His own personal career prospects, emotional well being and the performance of his monetary policy were all "a hostage to monsoon" like it was for most Indians. Additionally, farmers, rendered jobless due to failed Monsoon rains tend to migrate city-wards. This crowds the city slums and further aggravates the job, infrastructure and sustainability of city life. Such is the magnitude of effect that monsoon casts on the lives of Indians.
Travel.
In past, people usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons. But with advent of globalization, travel during monsoons is gaining popularity. Places like Kerala, Western Ghats get a very large number of tourists, both local and foreigner during monsoon season. Kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in Ayurvedic treatments and massage therapy. One major drawback of traveling during monsoons is the fact that most of wildlife sanctuaries are closed during this rainy season. Also, some mountainous areas, specially in Himalayan regions get cut off due to damaged roads caused by landslides and floods during heavy rains.
Environmental.
The Monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to bodies of water in the area. The peninsular/Deccan rivers of India are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature depending primarily on the Monsoon for water supply.
Similarly most of the coastal rivers of Western India are rain-fed and Monsoon dependent. As such, obviously the flora, fauna and the entire ecosystem of these areas are heavily dependent on the Monsoon.

Renaissance India

"Renaissance" is an annual 3-day event that takes among educational institutes in India around March/April, as a congregation for social entrepreneurs and non-profit enterprises.
One unique aspect of this event is that it doesn't take place in the same institute as most other events are known to do. Akin to Olympics, one institute passes it on to another and so the geographical location as well as organizing team changes each year. 
The first Renaissance event was organized in April 2010 at VNIT, Nagpur. 
In 2011, it was conducted at BITS Pilani from 4 to 6 March 2011.

Jurassic Forest (tourist attraction)

Jurassic Forest is a seasonal tourist attraction located on Highway 28 just north of Gibbons, Alberta, just minutes away from Edmonton, Alberta by vehicle. The facility is situated in a mature boreal forest setting and features more than 40 animatronic dinosaurs in their natural habitat. The dinosaurs can be easily viewed from wooden trails that lead through the forest. The trail system consists of two separate loops, the South Discovery trail and the North Discovery trail with each measuring about 1.0 km in length. The trails are wheelchair friendly and are accessible in all types of weather conditions.
History.
Jurassic Forest is an educational and entertainment centre that opened on Friday, July 30, 2010. When it opened, the facility featured a total of 42 animatronic dinosaurs, an interpretive centre, concession and gift shop area. In 2011, several facility enhancements were undertaken including the development of an upgraded concession area, enhanced playground area and the addition of three interactive educational displays inside the interpretive centre. A new dinosaur was also added to the North Discovery trail, as the Spinosaurus became the 43rd dinosaur to be featured at Jurassic Forest.
In 2012, the addition of three new Pachyrhinosaurus, and a Troodon highlighted the opening of the new season.
In 2013, the expansion of the discovery trails continued with the brand new North and South trail extensions. "From Scales to Fur" is the theme of the south extension. "Taking Flight" is the theme of the north extension. Both trail extensions are featuring new creatures that are not consistent with the dinosaur only displays of the past three years. With these new animals, the total number of displays is now 51 animals.

C-5 (blimp)

C-5 was a hydrogen-filled C class blimp operated by the U.S. Navy in 1918 and 1919. It was part of a 10-blimp series built by Goodyear and Goodrich and was intended to capitalize upon the navy's experience operating blimps during World War I. The C-5's engines were built by Hispano-Suiza, and its control car was built by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In early May 1919, the C-5 made a pioneering flight from its home base at Cape May, New Jersey to Montauk Point, New York and St. John's, Newfoundland, becoming the first airship to reach that city and in the process sending the first radio voice transmission from Newfoundland. The C-5's goal was to fly across the Atlantic, paralleling the route used by the U.S. seaplane NC-4. Previous attempts to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a balloon were unsuccessful. The most famous of these attempts was that of the dirigible "America" in October 1910.
On 14 May 1919, the C-5 departed Montauk Point in clear weather. It made good time, but encountered fog near Saint Pierre Island, Canada and became lost for several hours. It eventually regained its way, but the extended trip caused the crew to exhaust its food supply, and bad weather continuously shook the blimp. The C-5 again became lost, this time over Newfoundland itself, when its radio navigation equipment malfunctioned. The C-5's crew used its voice radio to contact the U.S. Navy cruiser "Chicago", which was in St. John's, and the radio signal was used to guide the C-5 to the tracks of the Colonial Railroad, which it followed to St. John's and a safe landing on 11 a.m. 15 May. The commander of the blimp, Lieutenant Commander Coll, said it was the roughest trip he had ever experienced.
Most of the crew was taken away to be fed, while the few remaining men began to overhaul the blimp's engines. In the meantime, a storm sprang up. Additional cables were tied over the blimp in order to secure it, and crewmen from the "Chicago" were brought in to help. The wind intensified from to , and the blimp began to break free from its additional cables. The blimp's engines couldn't be restarted because they were under maintenance, so Lieutenant Charles Little attempted to pull the emergency cord to open the blimp's airbag and deflate it. The cord broke, and the blimp began to lift off, tearing a few remaining cables that injured two people as they sprang loose. Little jumped from the rising blimp, spraining his ankle, and the C-5 drifted east, into the Atlantic Ocean.
The destroyer USS Edwards was dispatched to catch the blimp, which flew throughout the afternoon and evening until cooler temperatures caused the blimp's airbag to partially deflate. The C-5 crashed into the Atlantic and was found by a British ship.
On the same day the C-5 broke loose from its moorings, the British government announced plans to send the airship R-34 on a transatlantic flight to Cape May, the C-5's home base. That airship successfully crossed the Atlantic, becoming the first aircraft to navigate that body of water from east to west nonstop.

<doc id="31096171" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31096171" title="FFA Cup">
FFA Cup

The FFA Cup is the main national association football knockout cup competition in Australia. The annual competition is organised by and named after Football Federation Australia. It features all the teams from the top division of the A-League as well as from lower teirs in the Australian league system, including from the National Premier Leagues and other state based leagues. Teams enter the competition in progressional stages, with qualifying rounds used to determine which lower division teams eventually join those from the A-League in later stages of the cup. It is currently sponsored by the Westfield Group and thus officially known as the Westfield FFA Cup.
The cup's inaugural season, will take place in 2014 and determine the first FFA Cup Champion. Discussions are required to ascertain whether champions from future editions of the competition will gain qualification into the continental competition, the Asian Football Confederation Champions League.
History.
Australia has a long history of regional and state-based knockout cup competitions. However, a sustainable national knockout cup competition that encompassed clubs on all levels of Australian league system has been hard to realise. Prior to the FFA Cup, the first and only Australian national knockout tournament was the Australian Cup. The Australian Cup was founded in 1962 but was abolished in 1968 after just seven seasons of competition. In 1977 a knockout competition was founded to run in parallel with the now defunct National Soccer League (NSL). The NSL Cup involved only Australian association football clubs competing in the then top-flight NSL and as such was not a true national competition as clubs in state based competition were not eligible to compete. The NSL Cup ceased after the 1996 tournament. An A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup competition ran between 2005-2008 but involved only the teams from the A-League and was not a traditional knockout format.
The FFA Cup was previously scheduled to commence in 2013, though after suffering numerous delays due to FFA's 2012 television coverage deal and rising cost concerns the competition was put on hold. After the signing of the new television deal in 2012, FFA's Chairman Frank Lowy stated that the FFA Cup had been put on hold until 2015 at the earliest. On 13 February 2013 FFA CEO David Gallop confirmed that the FFA Cup was in development but would not commence before 2015 due to priority to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2015 AFC Asian Cup and the A-League and National Premier Leagues. Nonetheless, Gallop later stated that he was hopeful the tournament could begin in 2014.
On 29 August 2013, it was announced that a national FFA Cup would commence in 2014, after what would be two years of organising the knock out competition. On 14 October 2013, FFA announced that it had appointed Sam Chadwick as General Manager of the FFA Cup. On 24 February 2014, the FFA Cup was formally launched by David Gallop.
The first ever member federation club to qualify for the FFA Cup was Tuggeranong United from the Australian Capital Territory. Tuggeranong United qualified for the 2014 FFA Cup as the winners of the 2013 ACT Federation Cup.
Format.
The competition proper is a 32-team knockout tournament with pairings for each round drawn based on a seeding system to ensure the progression of teams lower down the Australian league system.
Fixtures for the FFA Cup will be decided on the date allocated for the fixture. In the event of a match being drawn after the completion of 90 minutes, extra time will be played. If scores are still level following extra time, the tie will be decided by a penalty shoot-out.
A draw for each round will be made from the Round of 32 to the Semi-Finals. Clubs will be allocated into various pots depending on the clubs method of qualification and the specific round of competition. The draw also determines which teams will play at home. If a Member Federation Club draws an A-League team, the Member Federation Club will host the fixture. However if two clubs at the same level are drawn together, the first teams drawn will host.
Unlike "normal" application of seeds where a draw is made to ensure that the top seeds don't meet until the latter stages of the competition, the draw for the FFA Cup is seeded in such a way that it ensures the progression of lesser seeds to generate exposure and revenue for grassroots football clubs. The seeded FFA Cup draw ensures at least three Member Federation Clubs will qualify for the Quarter Finals with one club guaranteed to make the Semi Final.
In order to minimise further impact that hosting the 2015 AFC Asian Cup will have on the 2014–15 A-League season, the inaugural FFA Cup Final will be held as a mid-week fixture on Tuesday 16 December 2014. From the 2015–16 edition of the competition, the FFA Cup Final will be played on a yet to be determined weekend date to emphasise the importance of the Final.
Eligible teams.
The 32 teams that make up the FFA Cup competition proper are the 10 A-League teams with the remaining 22 teams composed of various semi-professional and amateur qualifiers, referred to as "Member Federation Clubs", from each of the state federations. The A-League clubs enter the competition at the Round of 32.
The number of clubs representing each federation was determined by player registration numbers in each jurisdiction. The Northern Territory will not participate in the inaugural competition, however will be represented from 2015.
Trophy.
At the end of the final, the winning team will be presented with a trophy, known as the "FFA Cup", which they will hold until the following year's final.
The trophy is a large traditional cup style trophy with an intentional resemblance to the historical Australian Cup trophy which ran from 1962 to 1968. The FFA Cup itself it made from silver-solded brass, which is plated with 24 carat-gold and sterling silver. It has two handles which each have the badge of Football Federation Australia inscribed on the inside corners. Also inscribed on the cup is the design of the FFA Cup and the words "FFA Cup". The trophy features two footballs, one as the base of the cup and the other as a trim, on the very top of the cup lid.
The FFA Cup trophy was created by D3 design, who also designed the A-League, W-League and NPL Champions silverware.
Sponsorship.
In its inaugural season the FFA Cup joined with an official naming rights partner. In 2014, Westfield Group was announced as the sponsor for the first three seasons of the cup tournament, known for commercial purposes as the "Westfield FFA Cup".
From 2014, Umbro will supply match balls for all FFA Cup matches, and will continue to do so for the first three seasons of competition. The FFA Cup Match Ball, the "Umbro Neo 150 Elite", was specially designed for the competition.
Media coverage.
There will be a minimum of 10 matches broadcast on Fox Sports. One of which will be a Round of 32 match, two will be from the Round of 16 matches, and all matches from the Quarter Finals, Semi Finals and the FFA Cup Final. Fox Sports may also choose to broadcast additional FFA Cup matches from the Round of 32. All broadcast matches will kick off at 19:30 (). FFA Cup draws from the Round of 32 onwards will also be televised live on Fox Sports.
Internationally, at least 10 FFA Cup matches will be broadcast live in Asian nations including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, after a three season deal with TEN Sports in 2014.

Goosebumps (video game series)

Goosebumps video games are a series of action-adventure games based on "Goosebumps" book series.
"Escape from HorrorLand".
"Escape from HorrorLand" was released in 1996 on the PC. 
The game acts as a sequel to the Goosebumps book, One Day at Horrorland. Lizzie, one of the protagonists from the book, calls the player character to her that night, stating that her brother Luke and friend Clay have suddenly disappeared after a strange bout of supernatural activity in her household. The only clues she has are the Horrorland tickets they got from their last encounter with the theme park. Heading back to her house, the tickets suddenly glow and suck the player character and Lizzie back to Horrorland. Stuck there and having no choice, the both of you go in search of Luke and Clay in hopes of finding an exit to the haunted theme park. Along the way learning the origins of the park as well as the creator, Madison Storm who built the park based on his own twisted childhood.
After making your way through the park finding Luke and Clay, gathering items to continue, and warding off the monsters that wish to harm you - you make it near the end to discover Madison also kidnapped Mr and Mrs. Morris (Lizzie and Luke's parents) and wishes to destroy the family, both as a spectacle for the monsters of the park as well as revenge for escaping the park the first time and making him look like a fool in front of the monster inhabitants. Clay manages to reach the monster generator, the thing that attracted monsters to the park, and overload it causing the inhabitants to flee but in the midst of the chaos Madison grabs the Morris siblings and Clay and ties them up, intending to be blown up along with the park. The player character manages to save everyone, prevent the park from blowing up and defeat Madison all at once. Clay, however, finds the remote to the park and presses one of the buttons, triggering the self- destruct of the park. The kids manage to get out in time before it blows.
The final scene in the game sees the kids make it home, but there are a few different endings. One is that the parents make it back safe and even greet the kids as they come home with the help of their new neighbor..."Maddy" Madison Storm. In the other ending, the parents fall into the pool and after the kids get home, they are greeted by their parents who have been turned into horrors.
This game features well known actors including Adam Wylie, Eric Lloyd, Isabella Rossellini and Jeff Goldblum.
"Attack of the Mutant".
"Attack of the Mutant" is a children's PC game based on the "Goosebumps" book "Attack of the Mutant" by R.L.Stine. It was developed and produced by Dreamworks Interactive and was released May 1, 1997. It was one of the first games to use cel-shaded animation. 
The hero gets off a bus at the wrong stop, and finds himself at the headquarters of the Masked Mutant. Within, he must work with comic book superheroes the League of Good Guys to prevent the Masked Mutant and his evil henchmen from transforming the world into a giant comic book.
The cast of characters included all of the comic book superheroes and super villains featured in the original book - the Galloping Gazelle, the Masked Mutant and the Magnificent Molecule Man - but also added many original characters, such as the mobster villain Pinky Flamingo. The hero, a non-gender specific (though in-game art suggests a male) child, is a classic video game silent protagonist. The Galloping Gazelle was voiced by Adam West (who played the same role in the TV episode of "Attack of the Mutant") while the Masked Mutant was voiced by James Belushi.
"Goosebumps HorrorLand".
Scholastic Book Company released a "Goosebumps HorrorLand" video game on October 28, 2008 in North America, and October 16, 2009 in Europe, to tie into the series, on the Nintendo DS, Wii, and PlayStation 2 platforms. Developed by Gusto Games in Derby, the plot follows a young child and his/her friends trapped in HorrorLand, where they must make their way through challenging levels to escape the evil theme park. Reports indicate the game is similar to the original Goosebumps HorrorLand game "Goosebumps Escape From HorrorLand", in which you had to beat the minigames of various levels to reveal who was behind events in the park and get back home. The official website reveals that HorrorLand in the game will have five main areas: Vampire Village (which serves as a hub connecting all the others), Mad Labs, Terror Tombs (an Egyptian-themed area), Fever Swamp, and the Carnival of Screams. Several of these areas are references to classic Goosebumps books or previous depictions of HorrorLand.
The game starts off with a Horror leaving a ticket on the player's doorstep. The player tears it up but the ticket mysteriously gets put back together. Afterwards, Nate comes by and both Nate and the player set out to HorrorLand. At the beginning the player gets into the Carnival of Screams. A Horror gives the player 20 tokens for rides to start off. The player must reach the fright level to get into Vampire Village, one of the five attractions of HorrorLand. The player must get a high enough fright level to get on the Roller Ghoster and save a young girl named Gigi, who is trapped on it. After the player saves her, she joins the player to get the ticket pieces back and leave HorrorLand. Later, when the player gets to Fever Swamp, the player discovers that a show with the Great Gargantua is closed due to the monster escaping. When getting to Mad Labs, the player must collect 100 tokens to get a mask (a reference to The Haunted Mask) and once completed it turns the player into a Horror. This allows them to go into the Horrors Only lounge to get a piece of the ticket. While in the lounge the player gets caught by Horrifico, the king of HorrorLand. While in Mad Labs, the sound of a woman saying "If you see a girl in a blue dress holding a monster doll, do not attempt to approach her. She is extremely dangerous." will play. This is a description of Gigi. The secret of HorrorLand is finally being revealed and the player must get 50 points for the fright restriction in order to get into Terror Tombs. Getting gold on the Pharaoh's Fairway will earn the last piece of the ticket. At the end of the game the Horrors grab the player. the player gets put on the final ride called Certain Death where the player must battle through to rescue Gigi and escape. Upon exiting, the player discovers that Gigi is the Great Gargantua, as she turns into the creature, and announces her plan to turn the entire world into her own HorrorLand. As she flies away, the screen fades out to the "The End" screen.

Empress Liu (Li Maozhen)

Empress Liu (劉皇后, personal name unknown) (877–November 8, 943), formally Lady Dowager Xiande of Qin (秦國賢德太夫人), was the wife of Li Maozhen, the only ruler of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Qi. During Li Maozhen's reign as the independent Prince of Qi, she carried the title of empress (even though he never assumed the title of emperor). After he later submitted as the vassal of the new Later Tang, she became known as the Lady of Qin, and later Lady Dowager of Qin after his death.
Lack of records in official histories.
Nothing was said about Empress Liu's identity in the official histories of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period — the "History of the Five Dynasties" and the "New History of the Five Dynasties". What was mentioned was that after the destruction of the preceding Tang Dynasty, Li Maozhen continued to use Tang's era name to show refusal to submit to Later Liang and continued to use the Tang-bestowed title of Prince of Qi. However, he took on much of the trappings of an emperor, including creating an Office of the Prince of Qi that had a large staff and many offices that had imperial government-like titles and creating his wife (who was not named) empress. No other reference was made in his biography in the two official histories about his wife.
Family history, based on Li Maozhen's and her tombstones.
What little is known about Empress Liu largely came from the discovery of her and Li Maozhen's tombstones in a 2001 excavation of their joint tomb. Based on the tombstone of Li Maozhen, who died in 924 at the age of 68, he had six sons and four daughters, and, at the time of his death (by which time he was a Later Tang vassal bearing the title of Prince of Qin), his wife Lady Liu was bearing the Later Tang-bestowed title of Lady of Qin.
Lady Liu's tombstone, which referred to her as Lady Dowager Xiande of Qin, gave more information about her, although it gave no personal name. According to her tombstone, she died on November 8, 943 at the age of 66, and that she bore four sons and three daughters for Li Maozhen. The four sons were his oldest Li Congyan, Li Congchang (李從昶), Li Congzhao (李從昭), and Li Jiwei (李繼暐). (The fact that Li Jiwei's name had "Ji" as his generational character rather than "Cong" as his brothers implied that he died before the bestowment of the "Cong" character by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang in 926.) Her three daughters were not named; the oldest was described as having married a man named Lu (盧) and having died early; the second and third daughters married officers of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), which made up most of the state of Qi, Han Fang (韓昉) and Zhang Juxun (張居遜), respectively. As for Lady Liu's family itself, she was said to be from Qi Prefecture (i.e., Fengxiang Circuit's capital Fengxiang Municipality). Her great-grandfather was named Liu Sichong (劉思沖); her grandfather was named Liu Ao (劉翱); and her father was named Liu Yuehuang (劉岳皇).

Spot Marks the X

Spot Marks the X is a 1986 Disney Channel Original Movie that starred Mike the Dog (from "Down and Out in Beverly Hills") as Capone/Astro, Barret Oliver (from "The Neverending Story", "Frankenweenie", "D.A.R.Y.L", and "Cocoon") as Ken, and Natalie Gregory (from "Alice in Wonderland (1985 version)", "Oliver & Company", and "Cranium Command") as Kathy, who, unlike her role as Alice in the aforementioned 1985 version, is seen with her real hair in this movie, which is brunette. It was produced by Gregory Harrison's production company, The Catalina Production Group, Ltd. in association with Walt Disney Television.
The film originally aired on October 18, 1986 on The Disney Channel in a commercial-free format, and then later on May 17, 1987 on ABC in a 2-hour format as part of the "The Disney Sunday Movie". It also aired in a 2-part format on that show, with part 1 airing on July 3, 1988, and part 2 airing the following Sunday.
Plot/Synopsis.
The movie starts out with three men in a car, Beevis, Elvis, and the gang's leader Doc Ross (Vic Dunlop, Jerry Wasserman, and David Huddleston respectively) trying to evade the cops, following a bank robbery, resulting in the sound of the alarms. Also inside the car is a Dog named Astro (Mike the Dog, but initially known here as "Capone"), when the car suddenly gets stuck in Shadow Park. The men and the dog then get out of the car, and bury the money, but not before Ross gets apprehended by the police, who also take Capone into their care. Three months later, Doc Ross is in jail awaiting trail and Capone is sent to an animal shelter. Elvis and Beevis attempt to free Capone in order to unearth the stolen money, but their attempt is thwarted when they fear attracting attention. Capone is in a special section of the animal shelter that cares for dogs of convicts, however when Capone's cage is broken and a janitor thinks a dog from the adoption kennels got loose, to which Capone is then put into the ordinary adoption section.
At an Elementary school, the movie introduces a boy named Ken Miller (Barret Oliver), and a girl named Kathy (Natalie Gregory). Although Kathy is his best friend, she sometimes come off as a huge pain. After-school, Kathy meets up with Ken at the baseball park to chat with him for a while. Meanwhile, Ross meets up with his lawyer at the county jail. Ross becomes furious when he learns that his dog has broken out of the animal shelter. Capone has managed to stumble onto Ken's house, much to Ken's surprise and delight. After playing with him for a while, he decides to name him Astro (unaware that his name was Capone). Kathy then shows up, and also grows a fondness for Ken's new dog. The two then spend a whole day with the new Dog.
The next day, Kathy begins to suspect something odd about Astro, as she feels that whoever used to own him taught him how to commit felonies. Meanwhile, just as Ross is about to go to trial, a fight distracts the guards, and he flees. Meanwhile, Ken and Kathy spend some time trying to train Astro to change his behavior, but with no such luck. They also discover that he has a thing for pine trees. The Dog catcher then informs Ken's parents the truth about Astro. Ken, Kathy, and Astro also overhear this.
During a game of pool with Elvis, Ross insists that they go back to Shadow Park, but Elvis refuses, because they've dug there long enough. Meanwhile, Ken, Kathy, and Astro, find themselves by there, and to their surprise, Astro manages to fetch for the bone, when suddenly, the Dog runs off to Shadow Park, and Ken and Kathy chase after him. When they find him, by a tree Kathy squeals in delight upon finding out that inside the patch beside it is money. Kathy insists that they split it 50-50. Suddenly, they hear Elvis and Ross and try to get away from him. The three of them then go to a botique to do some shopping with the cash that they've just found.
Afterwards, Ken notices a small slip of paper with the words "Tim Ak Bak" on it. Ken immediately assumes that it says "Timberlake Bank". Kathy then reminds Ken of when his parents came over for dinner one time, and that everyone was talking about a bank robbery three months ago. It soon comes to their attention that the money was stolen. Ken and Kathy then go to a local library, and upon doing some research through a microfilm reader, they find out that the guys in the forest made the headlines, and that they allegedly stole $250,000. Ken and Kathy only found part of it.
Ken and Kathy then see the cops, and Kathy tries to create a distraction by talking to the cops, when suddenly, in an attempt to avoid the Dog catcher, Astro runs over to the trousers of an officer, and bites it off upon seeing the handcuffs. The Dog then runs away, as once again, Ken and Kathy hurry to chase it. Ken sees Neal, and uses him as an attempt to distract the Dog Catcher so that Astro won't get caught.
Back in the forest, Ken and Kathy, with the help of Astro, manage to find the rest of the money. They then head back to the botique to give Astro a new look so that he won't get caught. Meanwhile, Beevis, Elvis, and Ross find Ken's home (while Ken's parents are away), as they break in. The kids and Astro see the Dog Catcher, and they make up the story that they traded him. The kids and the Dog arrive back at Ken's house, when suddenly, the kids are distracted by the sprinklers, causing the colors on Astro to fade away. They manage to flee, and meet up with Neal, as Ken gets him to lock the gate to his house. Beevis, with the help of Elvis, makes it over the fence, but is hit in the stomach by a ball from Neal's batting machine.
After fleeing for a while, the kids and the Dog find themselves inside Saul's backyard. They then see the bad guys, and flee through the other door. They make it back home and try to hide the money, and tell the parents about Astro, when the Dog Catcher suddenly comes in. Unfortunately, the Dog gets taken in, and it seems that all hope is lost. As Ken and Kathy attempt to get Astro back, Ken's parents are shocked when they find out that one of the presents is money. The kids arrive in Shadow Mountain, and they look on as Dodge (Richard B. Shull) arrests the crooks. Just as Ross thinks he's back with Astro, the kids find him, and command him to come back to them. Ross then orders the kids to hand over the bags of money when suddenly, Astro jumps over and attacks him. Ross tries to shoot him, but the kids beg him not to, and he throws the gun. He then tries to leave with the money, as the kids chase him over the cliffside of a gorge. Ross is suddenly surrounded by cops, and the kids and the Dog on both sides of the bridge, just as Ken's parents come looking for him. Suddenly, Ken trips on the bridge, and loses the money. Ross is arrested, along with the other crooks and Dodge, and the day is saved. 
The movie ends with the kids reading the newspaper about the recent arrests, as they sit along with Astro in Stanley Park, who they are able to keep after all. The Dog is also now smart enough not to take things from other people that don't belong to him. Just then the Dog starts to suspect something, as the kids chase him down and as it turns out, he was simply chasing a pickpocket. The Dog is proclaimed a hero. Suddenly, the Dog sniffs something interesting underneath a tree. The kids go to see what it is, and it turns out it's a treasure map, that shows a drawing of the totem poles in Stanley Park (which also happens to be right in front of them), and an "X", where the treasure is supposedly buried. The Dog then runs to the totem poles, encouraging the kids to follow his lead, as the movie ends.
Availability on home video.
The film was released on home video in the U.K. by Walt Disney Home Video in PAL format. It was also released in France as "Capone Chien Gangster", and in Germany as "Ein toller Hund". No NTSC home video releases are currently planned.

IPPA is a physical examination with four key steps: inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.
Although the steps are consistent across organ systems, the order may vary. Notably, for the abdominal exam, auscultation is performed before palpation, because the act of palpation could change what was auscultated.

Srinagarind Dam

The Srinagarind Dam ("also known as the" Srinakarin Dam) is an embankment dam on the Khwae Yai river in Si Sawat District of Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. The main purpose of the dam is river regulation and hydroelectric power generation. The dam's power station has a 720 MW capacity of which 360 MW is pumped storage.
Background.
Feasibility studies for the dam were carried out between May 1967 to May 1969 and designs between September 1970 to December 1977. Initial construction on the dam began in 1974 and it was complete in 1980. The first of the dam's generators was commissioned in 1980 and the last by 1991. The original cost of the dam was estimated to be $45 million but because the dam was constructed on a fault line, the dam's foundation had to be reinforced which raised the cost to $114 million.
Design.
The Srinagarind Dam is a tall and long embankment dam. It withholds a reservoir of . The dam's power station has an installed capacity of 720 MW and contains three 120 MW Francis turbines and two 180 MW Francis pump-turbines. The pump-turbines serve the dam's pumped-storage capability and generate electricity during peak hours. In off-peak hours, the pump turbines return water from the lower reservoir back into the upper reservoir.

Spitfire Mark I

__NOTOC__
The Spitfire Mark I was a utility helicopter built in the United States in the late 1970s and intended for series production. In essence, the Mark I was an Enstrom F-28 that was modified to use an Allison 250 turboshaft engine and geared transmission in place of the original piston engine and system of vee belts. The resulting powerplant installation was lighter and more compact, which allowed for additional cargo or fuel.
Spitfire Helicopters' parent company, Fetsko Aviation Sales and Transportation began work on the prototype in January 1976, and on a number of pre-production aircraft in February 1977. Fetsko displayed a mockup of the concept at the National Maintenance and Operations Meeting at Reading, Pennsylvania in June 1976.
The prototype (registered "N4890") first flew in December 1978. By May 1979, Spitfire had supplemental approval for the turbine conversion and by July, the company reported that it had sold 42 examples of the Mark I and Mark II and expected to build 60 aircraft during 1980. The engine installation on production models was to be slightly further forward than on the prototype. 
However, Spitfire remained dependent on Enstrom to supply airframes for remanufacture, and Enstrom distanced itself from the project somewhat. Competing plans by Enstrom and Spitfire to market Polish-built Mil Mi-2 helicopters in the United States might have contributed to the friction. In Spitfire's version of the deal, Polish manufacturer PZL-Świdnik would also contribute to the Spitfire manufacturing efforts. By November 1979, Enstrom refused to supply airframes to Spitfire.
The situation improved somewhat in the 1980s, and Spitfire president Jack Fetsko reported in May 1983 that relations with Enstrom had improved to the point where the two companies could "talk programs". By that time, costs had increased from $US 165,000 expected in 1979 to $US 285,000 but Spitfire had taken deposits for 50 Mark Is, and had a firm sale for the first production aircraft. Together with companies Sodian and Soprea, Spitfire formed a new venture, Spitfire Helicopters International, to manufacture the Mark I and Mark II in Málaga, Spain. 
Nothing came of the joint venture, and Spitfire's attempts to market F-28 derivatives came to an end. In the 1990s, Enstrom marketed its own turbine-powered version of the F-28 as the Enstrom 480.

Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival

The Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival (VCBF) is an annual spring festival held in Vancouver, British Columbia to celebrate the beauty of Vancouver’s cherry trees. The festival’s fundamental objectives includes public education through seasonal, cherry-themed, city-wide viewing programs, musical performances, and fine art and craft exhibitions. It enables Vancouverties and those in surrounding areas to appreciate the beauty of cherry blossoms.
History.
The Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival was founded in 2005 by Linda Poole, its director, to commemorate the 37,000 cherry trees given by Japan to the City of Vancouver. The first Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival was held in 2006, with support from the Vancouver Board of Trade, as a 'Spirit of Vancouver' initiative. In 2007 it was formally recognized as a charitable nonprofit society.
In 2008, the festival was offered a home at Vancouver's VanDusen Botanical Garden. On April 2, 2008, a cherry grove was planted at VanDusen, dedicated to the festival’s "Blossom Benefactor", the Honorable Dr. David C. Lam. In 2008, a haiku stone presenting winners of the first three years of the festival's Haiku Invitational awards was installed in the garden amid the cherry grove.
In 2011, the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival began to sell "Birthday Blossom" cherry trees for a limited time to celebrate Vancouver’s 125th Birthday. The planting of these 3,000 trees all over Vancouver will help ensure that cherry trees are celebrated and appreciated. As expressed by Vancouver’s Mayor Gregor Robertson (2010), the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival is a popular tradition in Vancouver that unites people to celebrate the beauty of cherry blossoms.
The fifth annual Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival ran from March 26 to April 22, 2011.
Events.
Haiku Invitational.
Each year the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival holds the Haiku Invitational, inviting people from anywhere in the world to submit their haiku in celebration of cherry blossoms. From these entries, judges select top poems from the following categories: British Columbia, Canada, United States, International, and Youth (age 18 and under) to be displayed inside Vancouver city buses and SkyTrains throughout the spring. Many additional poems receive Sakura Awards and honorable mentions, and are displayed on the festival's website, together with information about learning and teaching haiku. Judges have included experienced haiku poets an'ya, LeRoy Gorman, Carole MacRury, Vicki McCullough, Michael Dylan Welch, and Edward Zuk.
Tree Talks and Walks.
At the beginning of March each year, Cherry Scouts give tours for the viewing of cherry blossoms all across Vancouver, including Oppenheimer Park, Queen Elizabeth Park, University of British Columbia, and Stanley Park.
Cherry Jam.
The Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival holds an event called the "Cherry Jam" as a kickoff to the festival. This free family event welcomes spring and the blooming of cherry trees to Vancouver. Each year the event has various musical traditions, with all ages participating.

The Cardiovascular examination is a portion of the physical examination that involves evaluation of the cardiovascular system.
It can involve a precordial examination and peripheral vascular examination.
Some portions of the examination may be best performed while sitting up (such as a neck bruit), while other portions may be best performed while lying back at a 30- or 45-degree angle (such as hepatojugular reflux.) Some portions (such as the heart sounds) may be evaluated in both positions, while others (such as the carotid artery auscultation) may be done in either.
Certain conditions can be identified upon inspection.

List of tallest buildings in Abidjan

Abidjan is the largest city in Ivory Coast. In Abidjan, there are 10 buildings that stand taller than . The tallest building in the city is the 30-storey, La Cité Administrative Tour D. The second-tallest building in the city is the Tour Postel 2001, standing at tall with 26 storeys.
Abidjan's history of skyscrapers began with the Ivoire InterContinental Abidjan Hotel Tower I (1969), La Pyramide Building (1973), and Immeuble SCIAM in 1975. Buildings in the city remained relatively short in the city until the late 1960s when the city experienced its first skyscraper boom. From 1969 to 1977, Abidjan witnessed a major expansion of skyscraper and high-rise construction. Many of the city's office towers were completed during this period, such as the Immeuble SIB. A near short lull in building construction came after this expansion, with a second, larger boom starting in 1982. Though this expansion was much shorter, lasting only two years, most of the city's iconic buildings were constructed during this time, including La Cité Administrative Tour D, the city's tallest building. 
As of 2011, Abidjan had 19 completed high-rise buildings, with none under construction or proposed.
Buildings.
This list ranks Abidjan high-rises that stand at least tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts.

Hugh Kennard

Wing Commander Hugh Charles Kennard, DFC (24 June 1918 – 1995) was a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II and later an entrepreneur in civil aviation.
Personal life.
Kennard was born on 24 June 1918 at Coxheath, Kent, United Kingdom, the son of Charles W Kennard and his wife. He was educated at Cranbrook School in Kent. Kennard's first wife was Jean Muriel Crossley and his second was Audrey, whom he married in November 1940. Kennard married Jane Neville in 1969 and the couple had two sons. He died in 1995. Kennard had one son by his first wife, Jeremy, and a further son, Julian by his third wife.
Career.
RAF career.
Kennard joined the Royal Air Force on a short-service commission in January 1938 as an acting pilot officer. His commission was confirmed in October 1938. During 1938, he bought the prototype Jaguar SS 90 roadster, registered ARW295. He served with No. 66 Squadron RAF and 610 Squadron between until 1940. In early 1940, he flew missions over Dunkirk during the evacuation and, in mid-1940, was engaged in combat missions over southern England. In July 1940, Kennard was promoted to flying officer and assigned to No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron as a flight commander in the Hawker Hurricane squadron formed by the Polish government at RAF Church Fenton in Yorkshire. The squadron became active towards the end of the Battle of Britain. Kennard sold the SS 90 some time after his marriage in November 1940.
In 1941, Kennard was promoted to flight lieutenant and assisted in the formation of No. 121 Squadron RAF, a Hurricane squadron composed of American volunteer pilots, based at RAF Kirton in Lindsey in Lincolnshire. The squadron became operational in two months. After converting from Hurricanes to Supermarine Spitfires, Kennard led the American squadron on missions across the English Channel. The station commander at the time purchased a five-gallon tin of peanut butter from Harrods in order to make the American personnel feel more at home. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war by the United States, Kennard is reputed to have proposed a toast with the words "You're all in it now, Yanks!" He was made squadron commander in early 1942 and was shot down and wounded in July while participating in a bomber-escort mission. Having flown 58 missions since taking command, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for a combat operation in May 1942 in which he engaged eight enemy aircraft, shooting down two, with a third claimed as probable and a fourth damaged. Later that month Kennard led his flight in a successful attack on a minesweeper and later still attacked and sank an armed trawler off the Dutch coast. Kennard relinquished command of the squadron in September 1942. In October 1942, Kennard was wounded in action. He was promoted to acting squadron leader in 1943.
Later career.
After relinquishing command of 121 Squadron, Kennard was assigned to the Directorate of Fighter Operations in the Air Ministry and then to a role overseeing troop movements. He returned to operations in May 1945, having been confirmed as a squadron leader, and took command of a Spitfire squadron – No. 74 Squadron RAF. He commanded a station until he left the RAF in 1946 and then served with the Royal Auxiliary Air Force from 1949 to 1952, commanding No. 500 Squadron RAF and flying Gloster Meteors. He was granted the rank of wing commander in April 1949. He took Anthony Eden, the squadron's honorary air commodore, for a ride in a Meteor. In 1949, Kennard was to have taken part in a Royal Auxiliary Air Force Race based at RAF Elmdon. He was due to fly a Meteor 3, but the aircraft was unable to participate in the race because of the weather at its base, RAF West Malling. He retired from active service and was appointed to the reserve in 1952 and relinquished his commission in 1959.
Civilian aviation.
After he left the Royal Air Force, Kennard became an entrepreneur in civilian aviation. He founded or became director of, several airlines and aviation-related companies, including Air Kruise, which ran Ramsgate Airport, and Silver City Airways. In 1946, Kennard formed Air Kruise at Lympne Airport. In August of that year, Kennard took delivery of the first civilian Miles Messenger, G-AHZS, from Miles Aircraft Ltd. The handover was made at Heston Aerodrome. Air Kruise operated Airspeed Consuls, Auster Autocrats, Miles Messengers, Miles Geminis and Percival Proctors. They also operated de Havilland Dragon Rapides.
Kennard and his wife came second in the 1946 Folkestone Trophy Air Race, the first to be held at Lympne after the war. In October 1948, Kennard formed the Kent Coast Flying Club, which was based at Lympne and replaced the Cinque Ports Flying Club, which had folded on 1 October. Amongst the aircraft operated was Miles Magister G-AKJX. In 1953, Air Kruise moved from Lydd to Ramsgate. In 1958, Kennard formed Aircraft Engineering and Maintenance Ltd at Ramsgate. The company overhauled aircraft engine gearboxes, hydraulic systems and instruments. As of 2011, AEM is known as Aviation Engineering & Maintenance Ltd and is a part of Rio Tinto Zinc.
Kennard was joint Managing Director of Silver City Airways until his resignation in November 1960. In May 1961, Kennard formed a new airline, which was to be based at Rochester Airport. This airline was Air Ferry. For operational reasons, Manston Airport was chosen as the base. Air Ferry commenced operations on 30 March 1963. In November 1964, Kennard formed Invicta International Airlines at Manston, following a takeover of Air Ferry by Air Holdings Ltd. Although based at Manston, the head office was at Ramsgate. On 3 January 1969, Invicta International was merged with British Midland. Invicta became "British Midland – Invicta Cargo. The merger was forced by London merchant bank Minster Trust. In July, the air cargo operation was sold back to Kennard, who formed a new company, Invicta Airways (1969) Ltd. In February 1973, European Ferries Group acquired a 76% holding of Invicta. On 30 September 1975, Invicta ceased operations as a result of European Ferries decision to cease airline operations. In February 1976, the assets of Invicta were bought by Universal Air Transport Sales, which Kennard had set up. Invicta was sold in 1980, Kennard left the company and established a business at Canterbury restoring classic cars.

Miami High School (Arizona)

Arizona's Miami High School (also known as Miami Junior/Senior High School) is located in the town of Miami, Arizona. It is the only high school in the Miami Unified School District, which also includes two elementary schools.
History.
The high school opened in 1916 in this small mining town. From 1925 to 1934, it housed grades 7 through 12, and it housed just grades 10 through 12 through 1937. Up until 2009 Miami High School housed the district preschool and grades 9-12. In 2009, in order to cut costs, the separate middle school, Lee Kornegay Middle School, was folded back into the high school for the first time in 75 years, returning the school to its current 7-12 grade range.
Enrollment before the Baby Boom averaged 400 students. In 1967, it reached its all-time enrollment high, 801 students, and it did not go below 700 for another decade. Enrollment has mostly declined since.
Sports.
Miami's mascot is the Vandals. The major rivalry this school has is with nearby Globe High School; the schools' football teams play for the "Copper Kettle" trophy.

EXtreme Radio Service

eXtreme Radio Service (eXRS) is a proprietary personal communication technology marketed by TriSquare in the United States. The radios, which are similar to other walkie-talkies, use the Part 15 low power communication 915 MHz band, and employ frequency-hopping spread spectrum FM technology to attempt to address some of the perceived shortcomings of FRS radios. Since the frequency in use is rapidly changed in a pattern defined by the channel number, transmissions cannot be monitored by commercially available radio scanners.
The radios hop on 50 actual frequencies from a pool of 700, giving ten billion unique frequency-hopping pattern combinations, known as channels Due to the extremely high number of available channels, users are unlikely to encounter others on the same channel, and malicious interference is unlikely unless the interferer knows the channel number being used. TriSquare claims that reliable communications can be maintained with up to 100,000 users in range of each other. This is in contrast to regular FRS or GMRS radios, which only permit 14 or 22 users to transmit simultaneously, one user per frequency, in range of each other, even with "privacy codes" or PL tones that simply prevent one user on a channel from hearing another on the same channel but do nothing to prevent interference.
The range of the eXRS radios is not explicitly stated, however, the manufacturer claims that it is equal to or greater than FRS and GMRS. Since the Earth is curved, the range of two way radios at these frequencies is limited to about 6 miles in good conditions, regardless of the advertised range.
Users report that ranges are similar to that of FRS radios. The 900 MHz frequencies, however have provided superior coverage inside cruise ships and heavy buildings. Common complaints have been a "loss of synch" between radios, causing loss of reception by other radios. This phenomenon was noticed to a much greater degree when more than two radios are in communication. This editor has used up to three radios with no encounters withthis problem. A theory is that radios are powered on in too close of a range with each other and are causing mutual interference, which is corrected when moved further apart.
By employing digital radio modes, the TSX300 is able to send SMS-type text messages directly to other radios, identify their transmissions with a user-defined name, and clone information and channels to other radios over the air. Due to the abundance of available channels, each radio can be given a "personal channel" which allows users both to contact individual radios privately and to contact multiple users on group channels.
No license is needed to operate the radios for personal or commercial use, and despite the name's similarity to the FRS allocation, the system is a proprietary design using a license free Part 15 band, rather than an official U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated service.
Company Status.
On August 1, 2012 TriSquare vendor Buy Two-Way Radios posted that, "TriSquare is going out of business and its products will no longer be available." No information is provided regarding other manufacturers picking up the proprietary technology.
As of May, 2014, TriSquare's web site is no longer available.
Equipment Avalability.
With the demise of TriSquare, no known retailers carry these radios. The few online retailers and auction sites that have any product lines carry only batteries and headsets. Rare listings for the radios themselves are at prices double to triple of the original retail prices.

<doc id="31096666" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31096666" title="Independent Transport Commission">
Independent Transport Commission

The Independent Transport Commission, abbreviated to ITC, is a research charity and think tank based in the United Kingdom, devoted to exploring issues in the fields of transport, planning and land use. It is politically neutral, and has established a reputation as a nationally respected independent voice on transport and planning policy.
It played a key role shaping policy in the 2000s (decade) with the publication of a series of authoritative and groundbreaking reports on road pricing, suburban planning, long distance travel, and the future of transport. 
The Commission delivers its work by publishing reports and policy papers, hosting special lectures and discussion evenings, and meeting with senior officials. It is currently chaired by Simon Linnett, Vice-Chairman of N M Rothschild & Sons.
History.
Foundation.
Following the publication in 1998 of the Labour government's transport white paper entitled ", Stephen Joseph, director of Transport 2000, suggested to Bernard Jenkin MP, the then Conservative Shadow Transport Secretary, that he would benefit from the services of a 'think tank'. 
In the event, putting together a think tank to serve the Shadow Secretary of State proved impractical. Many of those approached liked the idea but did not want to serve a political party. This impasse was resolved when, thanks to Professor Mike McDonald, the infant ITC was offered a home by Professor Sir Howard Newby, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Southampton. The 'Independent Transport Commission', as it was then christened, was formally launched at the Royal Society of Arts in October 1999.
The New Labour Era.
In 2000 the Commission invited Sir Patrick Brown, former Permanent Secretary to the Department for Transport, to be its Chairman. Sir Patrick led the Commission through several major projects, encouraging greater boldness in Labour's transport policy, and leading debate on a number of issues. He was succeeded by Dr David Quarmby CBE, who steered the Commission through the development of a new Long Distance Travel forecasting model, the first of its kind. In 2009 Quarmby left to lead the RAC Foundation and was succeeded by Simon Linnett, Executive Vice Chairman of Rothschild.
The Coalition Era.
The election of the Conservative led coalition in 2010 led to fresh opportunities after the spending cuts saw the demise of the government's own transport quango, the Commission for Integrated Transport, leaving the ITC as the main think tank in the field. The ITC's own work on Transport Appraisal and Spending was later submitted to the Transport Select Committee for discussion.
Activities.
'Forward Thinking' Discussion Evenings.
The Independent Transport Commission hosts a regular series of Discussion Evenings at the Alan Baxter Gallery in Farringdon. The Commission uses these to develop new policy thinking, and guest speakers at previous events have included Sir David King, Professor Stephen Glaister, and Andrew Haines.
Influence.
In response to the Labour Government's Transport 10 Year Plan the ITC released in 2001 a report on 'Tomorrow's Transport' calling for bolder policy initiatives to tackle potential future problems. The report was widely reviewed, particularly the conclusion that traffic would eventually become increasingly unmanageable in suburban and rural areas, and helped shift policy in the direction of 'liveable streets'.
Transport.
Road Pricing – The Commission published a series of reports on Road Pricing in the mid-2000s (decade) led by Professor Stephen Glaister. The reports were welcomed by the government as evidence that road pricing could pay for new roads. At the same time the ITC noted that the government would have to be clear where the extra money would be spent, and warned that there was a risk of increasing congestion on rural roads.
Long Distance Travel – In 2010 the ITC published the results of a three-year project developing a model to forecast long distance travel demand in Britain. The study indicated that economic growth remained the single biggest factor affecting long distance travel demand in Britain, and noted that in the absence of major policy measures the demand for air travel would accelerate. The findings have recently been seized by the opposition to High Speed 2 to show that passenger growth arising from High Speed Rail could be limited.
Land Use and Planning.
Suburbs – The Commission asked Professor Marcial Echenique of the University of Cambridge to report on the future of British Suburbs and Exurbs. Echenique's report warned that current policies would encourage suburban expansion, increasing both commuting times and carbon emissions, forcing a rethink of government policy.
Land Use Effects of the 10 Year Plan – Fearing that transport and land use policy had become increasingly disconnected, in 2002 the ITC commissioned Sir Peter Hall to investigate the land use effects of the Government's 10 Year Plan. Hall's conclusions that the Plan would encourage urban sprawl and threaten regeneration was credited with encouraging a re-orientation of policy towards more brownfield development.

Just Us (film)

Just Us is a 1986 telemovie, based on a true story and the autobiography by Gabrielle Carey, of the same name. Set in Sydney, Australia, but filmed mainly in Melbourne, it starred Scott Burgess and Catherine McClements. It was written by Ted Roberts and directed by Gordon Glenn.
Plot.
The autobiography written by Gabrielle Carey tells her story of how she made the 'mistake' of falling in love with Terry Haley, a prison inmate at Parramatta Gaol.
The character's names were changed for the movie, in which, Jessica Taylor (McClements), a young journalist, is sent to a maximum security prison to watch a debate and gather up information for a story she is writing. It is there that she meets long-term prisoner Billy Carter (Burgess), and after a while, the pair fall in love and want to get married.
"Just Us" is a moving account of a love affair, a totally honest portrait of two people - and a fierce indictment of our prisons and the ways we choose to punish people.
Filming Locations.
"Just Us" was filmed in Melbourne, though set in Sydney and Adelaide. The locations of both Parramatta Gaol and Yatala Gaol was filmed using the exterior and interior of Old Melbourne Gaol.

Pleated surface

In geometry, a pleated surface is roughly a surface that may have simple folds but is not crumpled in more complicated ways. More precisely, a pleated surface is an isometry from a complete hyperbolic surface "S" to a hyperbolic 3-fold such that every point of "S" is in the interior of a geodesic that is mapped to a geodesic. They were introduced by , where they were called uncrumpled surfaces.
The Universal Book of Mathematics provides the following information about Pleated surfaces:
"It is a surface in Euclidean space or hyperbolic space that resembles a polyhedron in the sense that it has flat faces that meet along edges. Unlike a polyhedron, a pleated surface has no corners, but it may have infinitely many edges that form a lami-nation."

<doc id="31096769" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31096769" title="Fallen woman">
Fallen woman

The term fallen woman was used to described a woman who has "lost her innocence", and fallen from the grace of God. In 19th-century Britain especially, the meaning came to be closely associated with the loss or surrender of a woman's chastity. Its use was an expression of the belief that to be socially and morally acceptable a woman's sexuality and experience should be entirely restricted to marriage, and that she should also be under the supervision and care of an authoritative man. Used when society offered few employment opportunities for women in times of crisis or hardship, the term was often more specifically associated with prostitution which was regarded as both cause and effect of a woman being "fallen". The term is considered to be anachronistic in the 21st century .
Theological links.
The idea that Eve, from the biblical story in the "Book of Genesis", was the prototypical fallen woman has been widely accepted by academics, theologians and literary scholars, yet crucially, such a reading overlooks that Eve was not expelled from Eden because she had sex outside of marriage; rather she fell from a state of innocence because she ate forbidden fruit from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That is, Eve and then Adam reached for knowledge, and in gaining it, they lost their innocence. The consequence was that they gained an understanding of the consequences of their actions, which they did not have before. The temptation offered to Adam and Eve in the story was to know what God knows and to see what God sees. It was a temptation based on desire, not sexual desire, but envy and a desire to be like God. In the context of fallen women, the metaphor of falling from innocence in sexual matters was more understandable when advice and reliable information about sex were lacking and sexual knowledge primarily depended on personal experience. Theologically, the metaphor is also related to the Fall of Man from a state of grace as well as to the expulsion and subsequent fall of Lucifer from heaven.
Social situation.
The term “fallen” was nevertheless most often conflated with sexual knowledge, particularly for women at a time when their sexual innocence was socially highly valued, indeed insisted upon. As the term narrowed to imply any socially unauthorised sexual activity, including pre-marital or extra-marital sex, whether initiated by the woman or not, it concealed the different reasons for such a "falling" out of God's and society's favour. “Fallen” was therefore an umbrella term that was applied to a variety of women in a variety of settings: she may have been a woman who had had sex once or habitually outside the confines of marriage; a woman of a lower socio-economic class; a woman who had been raped or seduced by a male aggressor; a woman with a shady reputation; or a prostitute. Furthermore, prostitution was defined in a range of ways and the "reality was that hard economic times meant that for many women, prostitution was the only way to make ends meet. Many ... were only transient fallen women, moving in and out of the profession prostitution as family finances dictated." 
In some cases, a woman may have been regarded as fallen simply because she was educated, eccentric, or elusive. Whatever the case may be, female fallenness as it appears in each of these renderings was the result of a woman’s deviation from social norms, in turn strongly linked to moral expectations. In the mid 19th century, for example, "For middle-class men seeking to establish a different basis for authority, from that which had been used by the nobility, moral authority became the key issue, evident in the power exercised by a man over the nuclear or bourgeois family and in his ability to regulate women's sexuality through her protection and containment in the domestic sphere."
Female dancers and performers have been regarded as deviating from social norms that expect women to stay away from the male gaze and hence have been described as belonging to the class of "fallen women". In Europe, women dancers were not socially acceptable and in Arabia, "the unveiled ghawazi, who performed publicly for men, were not respected".
Rescue and rehabilitation.
One of the effects of the rapid urbanisation resulting from the Industrial Revolution in England was that a large number of prostitutes were working in the capital, London. The problem for the city and for the women themselves was very evident and it prompted many rescue and rehabilitation efforts, especially by middle-class women inspired by religious conviction or feminist principles or both. Some people worked on changes to legislation or served on committees to raise funds for charitable initiatives. Josephine Butler, for example, in the context of her efforts against the Contagious Diseases Acts wrote: "You must know there are many good men and women in our country who have devoted their lives to the work of reclaiming prostitutes, and of offering protection and aid to women and young girls, who through poverty, ignorance, or evil companionship are in danger of falling into sin. And because several persons working together can do more than each working alone, societies have been formed for this purpose, one of which, the Rescue Society, has in the last seventeen years, opened the doors of its various Homes to no less than 6,722 fallen women and girls, of which number seventy out of every hundred have been restored to a virtuous life, whilst lack of funds has compelled it reluctantly to refuse admission to many others who implored its aid." 
Many of the homes were "strict, punitive and vengeful" but Urania Cottage, set up and managed by Charles Dickens with the help of his rich, philanthropic friend Lady Burdett-Coutts was "more agreeable", run with "good sense and good will."
Most famously, the Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone worked directly with fallen women to try to rescue them from their circumstances. At considerable risk to his political career, Gladstone spent a great amount of his own money and time on this effort, assisted by his wife, Catherine Gladstone. "There are more entries in Gladstone's diaries about prostitutes than there are about political hostesses, more recorded visits to the fallen women on the streets of London than recorded attendances at the balls and soirées of the "grandes dames" of polite Victorian society."
Rescue work among prostitutes was also part of the missionary work done by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), who also petitioned against alcohol and opium. In a speech to the National Purity Congress in 1895, WCTU temperance campaigner and social reformer Jessie Ackermann said: "From time immemorial we have read of fallen and outcast women, forms of speech used only in reference to our sex. To my mind the time has now come when we should apply the same term to sinful man ... the great weakness of our rescue work in the past has been its onesidedness. It has busied itself in reclaiming women, while men have been passed by." 
What "amounted to conventional Victorian 'rescue work' for 'fallen' women" was carried out in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War on behalf of the United States Government as part of a much broader "social purity" campaigns to prohibit prostitution and alcohol and other "social evils".
Fallen women in art and literature.
As a genuine social concern as well as a metaphor for artistic explorations of vice and virtue, the theme of the fallen woman has a notable place in art and in literature. In some cases, such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Blake, the artist/author has produced companion pieces in both forms.
John Milton.
Aside from the "Bible", it was John Milton's famous and influential poem "Paradise Lost", (1667) that communicated the story of the Fall and its consequences most powerfully. The idea of the fallen woman is most closely related to those sources which represent the fallen woman as an agent, as opposed to a passive receptacle, in the act of her undoing. For example, in “longing to reign rather than serve” Eve is ambitious for knowledge. The difference between these religious renderings of the iconic figure and the fallen woman presented in most 19th century texts is that the latter is suppressed/ disempowered/ silenced in her representations: “he Victorian fallen woman is usually depicted . . . as a mute, enigmatic icon . . . who sleeps through the poem that probes her nature” 
Lord Byron.
Lord Byron uses the idea of the fallen woman to relate vice and virtue and consider the effects of infidelity and inconsistency in his poem "Mariano Faliero, Doge of Venice".
William Blake.
William Blake's series of poems "Songs of Innocence and of Experience" (1789-1794) contrasts the two states in the context of industrialising England, the context in which women became more likely to "fall" as a result of great social change. Blake's poetry explores his deep concern about poverty and its effects as well as the relations between those in authority with those who are controlled by it, including moral generalities and the relations between the sexes. The connections between the Fall of Man and societal restrictions on sexual love are part of those broader concerns.
Pre-Raphaelite painters.
The theme of the fallen woman was becoming increasingly popular at the time that Rossetti began his picture "Found". Conceived in 1851, it was described by Helen Rossetti as follows: "A young drover from the country, while driving a calf to market, recognizes in a fallen woman on the pavement, his former sweetheart. He tries to raise her from where she crouches on the ground, but with closed eyes she turns her face from him to the wall."
William Holman Hunt, like Rossetti a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, spent some time searching for a 'suitable' subject for his painting "The Awakening Conscience" and he "found it after reading about Peggotty and Emily in Charles Dickens's novel "David Copperfield", and after frequenting the London streets where fallen women could usually be found."
Elizabeth Gaskell.
The character of Esther, who becomes a prostitute in Elizabeth Gaskell's novel "Mary Barton" (1848) is an example of a fallen woman being used to illustrate the social and political divide between rich and poor in Victorian England. The novel is set in a large industrial town in the 1840s and it "gives an accurate and humane picture of working-class life ... Esther is presented as something other than merely a bad girl; the abyss into which she falls is the same gulf that separates Dives from Lazarus". 
In terms of the construction of the novel, the conventions of the time required that sexual actions took place offstage or not at all. Readers (particularly female readers) were encouraged to imagine and condemn the actions that caused the character's fall but as with other authors concerned about the effects of poverty on people at the time, especially women, Gaskell's "conscious aim is to bring Christian principles as a mediating force within class antagonisms."
Charles Dickens.
Aside from the well known critiques of society in his novels such as "David Copperfield", (1850), Charles Dickens set up and managed Urania Cottage - a home for homeless women. He disagreed with the prevailing idea that once corrupted, especially by prostitution, and therefore fallen, a woman could not be uncorrupted or redeemed. Rather he wanted to treat them well and train them for other employment but he needed to convince his benefactor that it was possible for fallen women to return to mainstream life.
Thomas Hardy.
Thomas Hardy's novel "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" (1891) explores the consequences for a heroine who became a fallen woman as a result of being raped. This is a key point because the author is trying to show that the consequences are independent of the heroine's actions or intentions.
Fallen women in film.
In cinema, the fallen woman is one of the earliest representatives of the female prostitute, and the theme had great appeal during the silent era. By the mid 20th century, when women had access to a variety of jobs and their sexual activity was no longer necessarily associated with moral corruption, the fallen woman as a theme was no longer relevant. The films sometimes intended to convey a moral lesson; sometimes they were a social commentary on poverty; sometimes they explored the idea of redemption or the consequences of coercion; and sometimes they were about self-sacrifice. These contrasts, such as innocence and experience; sin and redemption; vice and virtue, as well as ideas about corruption, class, exploitation, suffering and punishment, build on themes in earlier literature. Some films, such as "The Red Kimona" (1925) in which the fallen woman was allowed to live happily at the end, were subject to severe censorship. "The Road to Ruin" (1928) was banned. "Protect Us" (1914)

Arad Museum Complex

The Arad Museum Complex () is primarily a history and archaeology museum in the city of Arad, Romania.
The museum presents archaeological items from the Iron Age, the Dacian Period, the Age of the Migrations and Early Medieval Period. Also showcases history items relating to the Revolution of 1848 in Transylvania and the Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918, ethnographical items, natural science exhibits relating to the Arad area, minerals, flora and fauna specimens, classical and contemporary Romanian art, European paintings from the 17th - 20th centuries, decorative art items and exhibits relating to the history of theater: programmes, posters, photographs, scores (the Iosif Sârbuț collection).
The museum building is the Culture Palace, a monument of architecture from 1913, by the architect Ludovic Szantay. The museum owns items listed in the Romanian National Cultural Heritage Treasure.
History.
The Arad Museum Complex was opened in 1893, as an exhibition of Relics of the Revolution from 1848, in the lobby from the 2nd floor of the local State Theatre. Two decades later, in 1913, the museum has been moved into the new built Culture Palace, along with the philharmonic and town library. Besides the old relics exhibition, archeological and medieval history collections were put on display and a European art gallery has been opened as well. In the inter-war period these have been completed with an ethnography exhibition and two memorial rooms dedicated to the local politicians Vasile Goldis and Stefan Cicio-Pop (1934).
After the communist overtake, the collections and the exhibitions have been reorganized in the spirit of the new ideology, the section of ancient history, the “Museum of the Revolution from 1848” and the art gallery being re-opened in 1954–1955 and the ethnography exhibition in 1956.
In the period 1958–1988 several sections of the museum have been opened in the county: Lipova (Town Museum – 1958), Siria (I. Slavici and E. Montia Memorial Museum – 1960), Savârsin (Art and Ethnography Museum – 1988) and Minis (Vineyard and Vine Museum – 1988).
After a radical reorganisation, which took more than two years, the archaeology and history exhibitions have been reopened in 1979, within the Cultural Palace. The Art Gallery has been moved into its actual in 1984.
As a consequence of the political changes from December 1989, the basic exhibitions have been liberated of the ideological ballast and in 1992 the a section of natural sciences has been opened, a year later the one of inter-war history as well. The Art Gallery, entirely reorganized, has been re-opened in 1998. The exhibition “Arad – December 1989”, came into public circuit in December 2004.
Since 1967, the museum issues its own scientific publication called "Ziridava", named after the nearby Dacian settlement mentioned by Ptolemy and archaeologically identified at Pecica. New scientific reviews are being edited since 1992: Studies and Communications of Art and Architecture, Natural Harmonies (1995) – researches from the field of natural sciences – and Zarandul (1999), containing ethnographic studies.
The multimedia workshop Kinema Ikon, part of the museum since 1990, issues the interdisciplinary review Intermedia since 1994, being one of Romania’s leading hypermedia art instances, a base on which the workshop represented the country at the 50th Biennial of Contemporary Art in Venice (2003).
Today, the museum manages a collection of over 125.000 pieces, being an active actor on the Arad cultural scene, assuming a reformative role.

Eamonn Boyce

Eamonn Boyce (born 1925) was an Irish volunteer of the Irish Republican Army. He was considered among the leading young activists in the organisation in the early 1950s along with Charlie Murphy, Robert Russell, Tom Mitchell, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Joe Christie. He and Murphy were responsible for the successful raid on a British military barracks in Armagh in the summer of 1954.
He was later captured leading an IRA arms raid on the military barracks in Omagh, County Tyrone, on 17 October 1954, for which he was sentenced to twelve years penal servitude in Belfast Gaol. In spite of the raid's failure, the resulting publicity surrounding Boyce's trial brought considerable recruits and funding for the organisation. Forty years following his release, Boyce's prison diaries were published as "The Insider: The Belfast Prison Diaries of Eamonn Boyce, 1956–1962" detailing daily life inside the infamous prison during the Border Campaign.
Biography.
Early life and IRA activity.
Born in Dublin in 1925, Eamonn Boyce was working as a CIÉ Bus Conductor when he was first recruited by the Irish Republican Army in 1953. His father had fought in the British Army in France during WW1, however he was heavily influenced by his mother's & uncles' backgrounds, fighting with Cumann na mBan & the IRA against the British during the Irish War of Independence & later against the pro-treaty Free State Forces during the Irish Civil War.He had previously been unaware of the organisation's existence, believing it long since disbanded since the end of the Irish Civil War, when he passed by a large billboard advertising an upcoming expose on the IRA by English Sunday newspaper. His attention was attracted to "a trench-coated figure carrying two guns", in particular, and initially thought the portrayal was related to the Irish War of Independence. When he mentioned this to his companion Matty O'Neill, a former Curragh internee, remarking on the garishness of the advertisement Boyce was surprised when the older man replied "Sure, them that's running it now don't mind." Intrigued that the organisation was still active, he investigated further and was officially brought into the organisation at age 27.
Raid on Armagh (June 1954).
A year later, Boyce, now Intelligence Officer, and Charlie Murphy began developing a plan to raid a British military barracks in Northern Ireland for weapons and other supplies. They enlisted a fellow Dubliner and IRA man to infiltrate the barracks by joining the British Army. The man was posted to Armagh, and while there, kept in contact with Murphy and Boyce at soldiers' dances. The two men would leave the hall, appearing to court the various girls they brought with them to the dance, but in actuality were meeting their informant and scouting the area outside the installation gathering substantial information on movement of troops & weapons storage.This information was backed up with detailed maps & photographs taken with a Minix spy camera. The eventually felt confidant enough to plan the raid for 12 June 1954.
The operation was launched from a farmhouse in Dundalk about a mile south of the border. The initial plan was to have a lorry transport the majority of the 19-man raiding party. The majority were armed with Thompson submachine guns as well as small arms, grenades and burglary tools. When the lorry failed to arrive, however, they were forced to improvise and called a local haulier on the pretense of moving a herd of cattle. The haulier, once he arrived, was forced into a tent and his vehicle stolen. The raiders left in two groups with the smaller of the two travelling in a car. They were specifically tasked with taking over the guardroom. That afternoon, at around 3:00 pm, the car drove through the barracks' gate. As the men held up the guardroom, one of the raiders took the place of the sentry. This man, having spent some time in the Irish equivalent on the British Territorial Army, was able to convincingly march up and down the gate.
The lorry carrying the rest of the IRA raiders overshot the gate while following behind the car and forced to reverse. As they did so, a British army lorry also entering the base allowed the truck to pull in first and drove by without noticing anything suspicious. In all, the raid netted 340 rifles, 50 Sten guns, 12 Bren light machine guns (most of which were deactivated), and a number of .22 mm arms. Though their activity was discovered during the course of the robbery, being necessary to put two soldiers in the guardroom, all the raiders were able to escape. The lorry was driven out first, with Boyce and a few others staying behind to lock every gate and door for which they could find keys for, before leaving in the car. The keys were later auctioned in the United States to raise additional funds for the IRA.
The raider's luck held and both the car and lorry were able to re-enter the Republic of Ireland without incident. At the Monaghan side of the border, a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary gave the lorry the right of way and were able to drive the last 7 miles safely. The party split up at a dump in County Meath, upon meeting with IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan, with some making their way back to Dublin by bus. Boyce and Joe Christie, another member of the raid, were to drive the lorry back to Dublin themselves. While Boyce sat in the back of the lorry, Christie climbed into the drivers' cabin and ordered the driver to divert from the pre-arranged route and onto the main roads. They eventually attracted the attention of a Garda police car on the outskirts of Dublin, having heard news of the Armagh raid, and attempted to block the road. Christie told the driver to ram the car but it was able to pull out of the way. The two men in the lorry were later taken into custody when returning it to its owner. They were questioned by police but were released partly due to lack of evidence, nothing save two revolvers were found in the truck, and the Irish government's embarrassment over the incident.
Omagh raid (October 1954).
On the night of 16 October 1954, Boyce led 35 men in a second weapons raid in Omagh, County Tyrone, the supply depot for the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. The previous week, Magan delivered 20 machine guns to a house in Dublin in preparation for the attack; a "carbon copy of the Armagh raid", it was also to have been co-led by Murphy but ordered to remain Dublin at the last minute. Gearoid O'Broin, a leading republican during the period, was in charge of the transportation for the raid consisting of two small cars and a lorry. Equipment was also brought to jump start British army lorries which the raiders hoped to later commandeer at the base.
The barracks was being guarded by three patrolling sentries with two watching the wall facing the town while a third soldier guarded back wall covering approximately 100 yards. The raid was supposed to have taken place at the changing of the guard but O'Broin had trouble securing a lorry and was forced to steal one. This caused a three-hour delay and, at 3:30 am, Boyce and 15 other men scaled the wall while the rest waited outside. Three of the men were armed with knives, assigned to neutralise the sentry on duty, and broke away from Boyce's group once inside the base. They headed towards an archway where the soldier was to supposed take shelter, and when he did not, the three attacked him. Instead of using their knives, they instead attempted to merely knock him out using the butts of their revolvers.
The soldier was able to fight off the three men and his shouts alerted the British soldiers in the guardroom near the main entrance. It was through the main gate that the raiders had planned to use to flee if things went wrong. With their escape route blocked, the soldiers now shooting from the guardroom, Boyce and his men retreated back the way they came over the wall and escaped into the surrounding marshes. The 20 other raiders outside the main entrance were left standing outside the main gate.
The raiders split up at this point, and in the confusion, Boyce was left behind with the lorry driving without him. He was not yet concerned about being pursued and was walking to the lorry, keeping a lookout for stragglers, when it suddenly took off when he was 50 yards away. He ran after the lorry but was unable to catch up. He then unsuccessfully tried to break into an RUC car parked nearby before resigning to walk the 20 miles back to the border. Boyce got as far as the Clogher Valley area, and while taking off his boiler suit in a ditch, he was captured by a Protestant farmer and his five sons, all of whom were heavily armed. He experienced some degree of police brutality following his capture, being "cuffed about" and forced to dress and undress in his wet clothes six times, before being transported back to Omagh to stand trial. At his trial, which he and his men refused to recognise, Boyce told the court "This war was not waged against any Irishman, but against a foreign Queen who has no right to have her forces on our soil." The 27-year-old Boyce, who was identified by authorities as the leader in the raid, was sentenced to twelve years penal servitude in Belfast Gaol. The rest of the men involved received ten years each.
Release and later years.
Boyce was released from prison after serving eight years of his twelve-year sentence. He was in poor health at the time, having trouble with his nerves, preventing him from "any of the normal things prison keeps a man from doing" such as crossing a street unaided, walking into a shop or applying to a labour exchange.This, he put down to the severe restrictions imposed on Category A Republican Prisoners & the 'Institutionalisation' of many years imprisonment. He found that his mother had also suffered during his incarceration, not only because of the emotional stress, but through the loss of Boyce's income and unknowing aiding his accomplices; for months, several hundredweights of gelignite had been hidden under her bed. He was eventually able to get his job back as a bus conductor and later married Dympna McConnell, a Grand Niece of Michael Mallin, Chief of Staff of the Irish Citizen Army, executed 8 May 1916 for his part in the Easter Rising. According to author Tim Pat Coogan, Boyce was a typical "example of what IRA men were like at the time and of what they encountered". Like of his contemporaries of the 1950s, he dropped out of the movement entirely. His prison dairies were published, entitled "The Insider: The Belfast Prison Diaries of Eamonn Boyce, 1956–1962", in 2007.

Northern Bee

Northern Bee () was a semi-official Russian political and literary newspaper published in St. Petersburg from 1825 to 1864. It was an unofficial organ of Section Three (the Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery) - the secret police.
"Northern Bee" was founded by the reactionary writer (and police informer) Thaddeus Bulgarin in 1825. In 1831 through 1849 he published it in conjunction with Nikolai Grech. From 1825 to 1831 it came out three times a week, then daily after that. The paper was pitched toward readers who belonged to the middle classes (the serving gentry, provincial landlords, officials, merchants, burghers). In addition to domestic and foreign news, literature, and criticism, the paper printed a mix of inspirational stories and philosophical essays, bibliographies, and fashion pieces. 
At first the paper showed a liberal bent, printing the works of Pushkin, Kondraty Ryleyev, and Fyodor Glinka. But after the Decembrist revolt of December 1825 it became a conservative pro-government publication.
By his own admission, Bulgarin worked with the chief of the Third Section, Count Alexander von Benckendorff, and used the knowledge gained by his position in writing reports for the police.
"Northern Bee" enjoyed a monopoly on political news and Bulgarin used its platform to express in various ways his disgust for constitutionalism and the parliamentary speakers in France and England, representing them as screamers and freethinkers in need of looking after by the police.
Having begun by publishing Pushkin and Ryleyev, including an enthusiastic review of the latter's poem "Voynarovsky", the paper turned to harassing Pushkin, mocking his antics and reproaching him for freethinking. In the 
French Romantics the "Northern Bee" saw "the legacy of the French Revolution, the destroyer of morality and the foundations of libertinism". The work of Gogol was characterized by the paper as portraits without any moral purpose, the "barnyard of human life".
In the pages of "Northern Bee", Bulgarin argued fiercely with the "Literary Gazette", Pushkin, Anton Delvig, the "Moscow Observer", "The Telescope", "Notes of the Fatherland", and Vissarion Belinsky. One of the leading critics for "Northern Bee", Leopold Brant, was a harsh detractor of the realist school which flourished beginning in the 1840s. 
After the defeat in the Crimean War, readership began to decline due to the radicalization of public opinion. After 1860, under Pavel Usov, the paper changed its course and printed work by democratic writers such as Vasily Sleptsov, Fyodor Reshetnikov, and Marco Vovchok, and reviews of Nikolay Nekrasov and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. The paper also published lesser-known writers such as Ilya Arseniev, Nikolai Gersevanov, Clement Kanevsky, and "Blind Domna" (Domna Anisimova).
An attempt by Usov to convert the paper to be more like foreign papers in format and arrangement of sections was not successful. In 1864, the paper folded.

2011 Antonov An-148 crash

On 5 March 2011, an Antonov An-148 crashed at Garbuzovo, Alexeyevsky Region, Belgorod Oblast, Russia, killing all six crew members. The aircraft was operating a test flight prior to delivery to the Myanmar Air Force. Witnesses reported that a wing had detached from the aircraft while in flight.
Aircraft.
The aircraft was an Antonov An-148-100E, c/n 41-03, carrying test registration 61708. The aircraft was operating its 32nd flight.
Accident.
The aircraft was operating a test flight from Pridacha Airport, Voronezh, Russia, when it crashed at Garbuzovo, Alexeevsky Region, Belgorod Oblast, some south of Moscow, and east of Belgorod. The accident occurred at 11:05 local time (08:05 UTC) and the aircraft was destroyed in the subsequent fire. Witnesses stated that a wing had separated from the aircraft while in flight. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations () confirmed that there was wreckage in two separate locations, apart. Further wreckage was found between the two sites. This included material identified as coming from the cabin of the aircraft. A photograph of the wreckage away from the main crash site apparently shows a horizontal stabiliser. The Antonov An-148 had only just been granted extended certification. The accident has been compared to the December 2002 crash of an Antonov An-140 in Iran. The six people killed were four Russian and two Burmese citizens.
Investigation.
Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation (Ministry of Industry of Russia) () have opened an investigation into the accident. A criminal investigation was launched by Russia's Investigative Committee () to decide whether violation of flight regulations occurred, leading to charges of negligent homicide. The first meeting took place on 6 March. The flight recorders were recovered from the wreckage. The wreckage of the aircraft is to be transported to VACO () in Voronezh for examination. Information from the recorders should be available to the investigation by 12 March.
Preliminary examination of data from the Flight Data Recorder shows that the airspeed indicator failed, showing too low an airspeed. In response to this, the pilots increased the speed of the aircraft past VNE, the never exceed speed, and the aircraft then broke up in flight. Amongst the areas being covered by the investigation are pilot error and fuel quality. There was no call to ground the An-148 following the accident.
