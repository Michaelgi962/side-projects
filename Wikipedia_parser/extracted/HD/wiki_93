Myron Norton

Myron Norton (1821-1886). an attorney, was an officer in the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers, fighting in the Mexican-American War, and remained in California afterward to become an active in both San Francisco and Los Angeles legal circles and politics. He drafted California's first state constitution.
Personal.
Norton was born in Vermont and studied at Harvard University. He died in 1857.
Military.
The day after he graduated from Harvard, he joined the Army and served under General Winfield Scott in the Mexican War. He then joined Jonathan D. Stevenson's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers, with which he came to California. He was a lieutenant.
In 1850–51, the settlers were fearful of an Agua Caliente Indian "insurrection" under Chief Antonio Garra, so "Regulars and volunteers were accordingly mustered to guard against this danger." The Los Angeles volunteers were commanded by General J.H. Bean, with Norton as colonel and chief of staff. In a letter written to Governor John McDougall, Bean commended Norton for his bravery.
Later, Norton was second in command of the first legal militia organization in the state, the First California Guard, where he was commissioned a first lieutenant on July 23, 1853.
In their requisition for arms[,] the company requested that seventy-five rifles and accouterments be sent to them immediately, as there were very few arms in the Los Angeles area except what was held by bands of organized villains of the worst type. The members preferred rifles[,] as part of the time they would be engaged in cavalry routine, especially when dealing with gangs of robbers or raiding bands of Indians.
Norton was one of the organizers and was elected chairman of a "large number of citizens assembled at the Montgomery House" on December 7, 1857, to demand protection by the U.S. Army from a feared invasion of Mormon fighters through the Cajon Pass in the wake of what was called the Mountain Meadows massacre, a Mormon attack in Southern Utah upon an emigrant wagon train in September of that year.
Legal and political.
In 1849, Norton was in San Francisco, where he was the county's first justice of the peace and then police magistrate. He also had a law office in the Laffan Building
In a vigilante-type trial in San Francisco, Norton was appointed to be defense attorney for a group of men called The Hounds, who were charged with serious crimes resulting from a rampage against Chilean immigrants.
As soon as news arrived from Washington, D.C., that Congress had failed to pass a bill authorizing territorial status for newly conquered California, Norton and Kimball H. Dimmick convened a committee in San Jose that issued a call for a state constitutional convention nevertheless. In March 1849 he was on a committee in San Francisco that urged the drafting of a state constitution instead of a territorial one. In a California-wide election for delegates, Norton received the second-highest number of votes, after Edward Gilbert. When work began in Monterey, Norton, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wrote the first draft of the constitution.
Norton resettled in Los Angeles and in 1851 was elected a judge of the Superior Court. On May 4, 1852, he was elected to the Common Council, the city's governing body. He served until May 3, 1853, and he was again elected in a special election on December 27, 1856, for a term ending May 6, 1857.

Yukon Men

Yukon Men is an unscripted American cable television series aired on the Discovery Channel. It is produced by Paper Route Productions. 
The series details the harsh life in the Alaskan village of Tanana where the population make their living by hunting and trapping game. It premiered on August 24, 2012. The show's prominent themes are community and survival. The television show is named after the nearby Yukon river and not the Yukon territory in Canada. Many of the residents of Tanana are of Northern Athabaskan heritage.
Initial reception.
Yukon Men's critical reception by media has been mostly positive. Mark A. Perigard from the Boston Herald stated "For a network that specializes in tough-guy shows (think “Survivorman” and “Deadliest Catch”), “Yukon Men” doesn’t stint on testosterone." Tom Conroy from Media Life Magazine said "The show doesn't need all this dramatic foreshadowing. The scenes of hunting, setting traps, dressing a carcass and even stoking the furnaces at the water plant are enlightening and fun. Most of the men work with their sons, and the bonding isn't overhyped. The half light of winter gives an extra beauty to the spectacular landscapes."
Key personnel.
Stan Zuray: Stan was raised in Boston, Massachusetts before he moved to Alaska. He is an outdoorsman with 40 years experience in the Alaskan wilderness. 
Joey Zuray: Joey is Stan's only 21 year old son. According to his father he is a natural at home in the Alaskan interior and he often traps independent of his father. 
Charlie Wright: Charlie is a water-plant operator, mechanic, trapper and hunter. 
Robert "Bob" Wright: Robert is Charlie's 20 year old son. Throughout the show he is being taught family traditions and skills such as beaver trapping by his father. 
The Moore family: Pat Moore owns the leading local kennel where his children Thomas Moore and Courtney Agnes work & wife Lorraine Moore. 
James Roberts: James is a major provider of lumber for Tanana. His teenage son, Francis Roberts, is helping with the business.

Zelly and Me

Zelly and Me is a 1988 American drama film written, directed and produced by Tina Rathborne. The film stars Isabella Rossellini, Glynis Johns and Alexandra Johnes, and features film-maker David Lynch in a minor role.
Released on April 15, 1988, "Zelly and Me" has received mixed reviews, citing its unsteady tone and a narrative which one reviewer felt would be more suited to a novel than a film.
Plot.
After her parents died in an aeroplane crash, Phoebe (Alexandra Johnes) lived with her grandmother Co-Co (Glynis Johns) and a nanny, Zelly (Isabella Rossellini). Co-Co and Zelly soon find themselves competing for the child's affections, leading to Phoebe growing isolated when Co-Co jealously fires all of her staff.
Production.
"Zelly and Me" was the first film by writer and director Tina Rathborne. The film was greenlit by David Puttnam during his tenure as head of Columbia Pictures, and was based on Rathbourne's own childhood. Rathborne cast Rossellini's real-life partner David Lynch in a small role in the film, as Rossellini's character's lover. As a result Lynch would later offer Rathborne the opportunity to direct for his 1990 television series "Twin Peaks". Lynch agreed to take part in the film at Rossellini's behest, in order to overcome his fear of acting.
Release and reception.
"Zelly and Me" was released on April 15, 1988. The film had previously been screened as part of the 1988 Sundance Film Festival, on January 23.
A review for Film4 has described "Zelly and Me" as unsure of its own narrative and tone, describing it as "a little uneven, nevertheless well worth a look". Writing for AllRovi, Iotis Erlewine rated the film two-and-a-half stars out of five. Vincent Canby, writing for "The New York Times", felt that the film did not work in cinematic terms, and that the story would have been better served as a novel. Canby also found himself unsure of how eccentric the film was intended to be, particularly finding that Lynch and Rossellini seemed "creepy", whether they "intended to be or not". 
The film's review at the 1988 Sundance Film Festival described it as a "deeply moving and beautifully acted portrait of childhood pain", adding that Lynch's role was played "with a wholesomeness that belies expectations". Writing for "The Boston Globe", Jay Carr felt that the film was clumsily written and lacking in subtlety. However, he felt that the acting throughout the cast was good, finding Rossellini, Johnes and Joe Morton to have performed well. Carr felt that the standout performance was by Lynch, describing him as "never anything but soft and gentlemanly on the surface, but there's always something scary about him".

William Horner Fletcher

William Horner Fletcher (1851–1831) was a New Zealand-born Australian accountant and mayor of Manly Council. He was a pioneering player of rugby union in New South Wales.
Early life.
Fletcher was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He was the second son of Kate (née Green) and Joseph Horner Fletcher (1823–1890), who was a Methodist minister and the Principal of Wesley College at the time of his birth. In 1861, the Fletcher family moved to Queensland and whilst his father was serving in Ipswich, Fletcher attended Ipswich Grammar School. When his father was invited to succeed John Manton as President of Newington College, Fletcher moved with his family to New South Wales and completed his high school education at his father's new school. He was a younger brother of Joseph James Fletcher (1850–1926) and older brother of Norman Vyner Fletcher (1867–1889).
Rugby.
Fletcher's father, Joseph, was a pioneer of rugby union. He was instrumental in 1869 in organising the first game of school-boy rugby to be played against the University of Sydney, and of inter-school rugby being played in Australia, between Newington and The King's School, Parramatta in 1870. William Horner Fletcher played in those games and then post-school played as a quarter back for the Waratah Rugby Club. He became the first secretary of the Southern Rugby Football Union in 1874.
Mid-life.
As an accountant from the 1880s, Fletcher worked mainly in the area of insolvency as a partner in the firm of David Fell and Co. In 1887, Fletcher married Louise Moore (d.1922), the of daughter Lewis Moore of "Tramore", Darley Road, Manly. They lived in Manly until 1919 in a house named "Erlsdon" and remained childless.

Kurama-dera

Situated in secluded wilderness at the base of Mount Kurama, it is accessible by its own cable car line, the Kurama-dera Cable.
History.
The temple was founded in the 8th century AD. Its origins are historically unclear, but it is said that the Chinese monk Jianzhen initiated a disciple into the Buddhist path, who saw in a dream in 772 that Mount Kurama had a spiritual power and built an esoteric temple to concentrate and control this power. It was burned down many times throughout the medieval era but the Buddhist statues and treasures inside it were always rescued and are today National Treasures. It is still believed today that tengu and other mountain spirits live in this area.
The temple switched between three different Buddhist sects over the centuries. Finally, in the postwar era, abbot Kouun Shigaraki founded his own religion and split the temple away from Buddhism. Thus the temple was finally able to reconcile with its "yamabushi" patrons and other unaffiliated, esoteric adherents of mountain worship.
Object of worship.
The original objects of worship under the Tendai order were Bishamonten, protector of the north, and the Thousand-Armed Kannon. However, in the worship hall another statue has been added to these two, which the current leadership says creates a trinity called the "Sonten". Bishamonten represents the Sun, Kannon represents Love, and the third statue, the Defender Lord, represents Power, together being the "Spiritual Kings of the World". The Defender Lord came from Venus 6.5 million years ago and is eternally 16 years old due to chemical differences in the atmospheres of the two planets. Some New Age writers identify the Defender Lord with Sanat Kumara.
The actual objects of worship are ordinarily concealed from view, but visitors can see replicas of all three images in the main building. The replica of the Defender Lord depicts a "xian"-like figure with a long beard, a big nose, wings, and a halo made of leaves. It is thought that the tengu in the area proceed from this Defender Lord.
Tourism.
It is an extremely popular temple for Japanese people to visit, owing to the many mysteries and occult events surrounding it, but does not appear in most English language guidebooks.
Yuki-jinja.
There is a famous Shinto shrine on the grounds of the temple called Yuki-jinja, which was founded in the year 940.

Olympias of Armenia

Olympias (, flourished 4th century, died 361) also known as Olympia, sometimes known as Olympias the Elder to distinguish her from her niece of the same name was a Christian Roman noblewoman. Through her father, Olympias was connected to the Constantinian dynasty and through marriage was related to the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia.
Family and early life.
Olympias was a Greek woman who was the daughter of the wealthy Cretan Flavius Ablabius by an unnamed woman. Ablabius was one of the most important Roman Senators of Constantinople; who held the Praetorian prefecture of the East from 329 to 337/338 and served as consul in 331, who was an active Roman Politician in the East and West. She had at least one known sibling, a brother called Seleucus. Olympias was born and raised either in Constantinople or Antioch, as her father during his political career was based in Antioch. Although her date of birth is unknown, Olympias may have been born between the years 324 to 330 and little is known on her early life.
Constantinian dynasty.
As Olympias’ father had acquired great influence over the Roman emperor Constantine I who seem to be attached to the emperor. Shortly before the death of Constantine I, the emperor along with Ablabius had arranged for Olympias to be engaged to Constans one of the sons of the emperor. When Constantine I died in May 337, he was succeeded by his sons and among them was Constans. In 338, due to her father’s fall out with Constans’ brother Constantius II and his initial execution, Constans never married Olympias. For as long as Constans lived, Constans took care of Olympias and they had lived together as if Olympias was the wife of Constans. In 350 when Constans died, Olympias still lived in Constantinople with the remaining relatives of Constans.
Wife of Arsaces II of Armenia.
The Roman Client King of Arsacid Armenia Arsaces II (Arshak II), was greatly favored by Constantius II who remitted all the Armenian taxes on the lands which the Kings of Armenia owned in Asia Minor. As a sign of the renewed Christian Arianism political alliance between Armenia and Ancient Rome, Constantius II had given to Arsaces II, Olympias as an imperial bride to him. Constantius II in the honor of Olympias, had struck special medals bearing the portrait of Olympias, who was the mother of the Greek King Alexander the Great, which the legend of the medals were in Latin "OLYMPIAS REGINA" or "of queen Olympias". The reigning Armenian Catholicos St. Nerses I, was sent by Arsaces II from Armenia to bring Olympias from Constantinople back to Armenia to marry her as his wife.
Olympias is considered as the first known wife of Arsaces II, as prior to his kingship was previously married to an unknown woman by whom he had a son called Anob. Saint Athanasius of Alexandria in a letter addressed to the Anchorites, reproaches Constantius II for marrying Olympias to Arsaces II. Athanasius reproaches Constantius II, for having an educated woman like Olympias destined to be a wife of an emperor exalted to the dignity of a barbarian (foreign) king.
When Olympias arrived in Armenia with St. Nerses I, Olympias was married to Arsaces II. Although Olympias had no children with Arsaces II, they appeared to have a happy marriage, as Arsaces II loved Olympias. The Romans considered Olympias as the legitimate wife of Arsaces II as this Queen consort, maintained her influence on her husband. Arsaces II was faithful to the Roman and Christian alliance and Olympias would have become a very powerful, wealthy and influential woman in Armenian society.
Pharantzem.
As Constantius II died in 361, Julian the Apostate succeeded his paternal cousin as Roman emperor. On Julian’s accession, Olympias’ influence on her husband made his fidelity to waver. Arsaces II later married the Armenian noblewoman Pharantzem who was the widow of Arsaces II’s nephew, the Arsacid Prince Gnel. In Persian fashion Arsaces II had more than one wife. Sometime after Pharantzem’s marriage to Arsaces II, she fell pregnant. In 360 Pharantzem bore Arsaces II a son, whom they named Papas (Pap). Papas was the only known child born to Pharantzem and the only known child born to Arsaces II during his Armenian Kingship.
Pharantzem had a grudge and had a great envy against Olympias, in which Arsaces II loved Olympias more than Pharantzem. Arsaces II loved Pharantzem to a degree but Pharantzem loathed Arsaces II saying, “Physically, he is hairy, and his color is dark”. After the birth of her son, Pharantzem plotted to kill Olympias through poison. Pharantzem had arranged for Olympias to be poisoned in 361 administered to her in the Holy Sacrament of communion by a priest from the royal court. Olympias was extremely careful in where she accepted matters of food and drink from as she only accepted food and drink offered to her from her maids. Olympias was poisoned through communion. 
The death of Olympias, was one of the reasons that the church was totally alienated from the royal court of Arsaces II and St. Nerses I being totally outraged was not seen again in the royal court in the lifetime of Arsaces II. The actions of Pharantzem towards Olympias had placed Armenian politics unfavorable to Christian interests and she was considered an impious woman. After the death of Olympias, Pharantzem became the Armenian Queen.

Who Wants to Date a Comedian?

Who Wants to Date a Comedian? is an American reality-based dating competition series that debuted in first-run syndication in the United States on September 19, 2011. The half-hour series was created by Byron Allen through his production company Entertainment Studios (which also produces numerous other syndicated programs including "Comics Unleashed" and "Comedy.tv").
The series, which is primarily syndicated to stations affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV and to independent stations (in addition to airing on ES-operated cable television network Comedy.tv), for broadcast in access, late fringe and graveyard time periods, is among the first dating series (along with CBS Television Distribution's "Excused", which debuted one week earlier and has featured some contestants who have also appeared on this program) to air in first-run syndication since the 2006 cancellations of "Blind Date" and "Elimidate". The series' second season debuted on September 17, 2012.
Premise.
The series uses a format similar to other elimination-based reality dating shows and plays on the notion and common preference of single people that a sense of humor is key to pursuing and sustaining a romantic relationship by having stand-up comics as the contestants choosing between three people vying to go on a date with them. The show periodically features routines performed by the comics appearing on the program during each episode, either from footage taped at Los Angeles area comedy clubs or clips originally featured on fellow Entertainment Studios-produced series "Comics Unleashed" and "Comedy.tv".
Format.
In the first round, a stand-up comic is introduced and informs the viewers about what they look for in a mate. The audience is then introduced to the three potential suitors through video profiles, which often feature interspersed footage of the contestant engaging in leisure activities. The comic then meets the suitors (usually three women for a male comic, though episodes in which a female comedienne having to choose between three male suitors occur on occasion); the dates are often held in simpler, though common locales for a date compared to most reality dating series (ranging from a home to an amusement park to a bowling alley, with entire episodes often set in one location).
After the comic is introduced to the contestants, the contestants give their first impressions to the comic. Following that, the comedian and all three contestants go out on a date, which often results in the comedian finding out other personal details about their dates, so as to determine based on their personality and their revelations as to who will be eliminated from the competition. All of the contestants will often end up doing fun activities during the date while impressing them. The group of three is cut down to two remaining potential suitors, whom the comic will then continue the date with for the third and final round, in which the contestant has to impress their date. The show culminates with the comedian deciding which of the two remaining suitors will go on to go out with them on a second date.

<doc id="36870687" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36870687" title="Makary, Cameroon">
Makary, Cameroon

Makary is a town in Logone-et-Chari, Far North Region, Cameroon, West Africa. The town is located on the right (east) bank of a distributary of the Chari River in the delta just before it enters Lake Chad. The people are known as Kotoko, and the local language is Mpade, Fulani (Fulfulde) is the trade language. The primary economic activity was and is fishing.
History.
Makary was part of the indigenous Sao civilisation that occupied the land south of Lake Chad from about the Sixth Century A.D. going into decline by at least the Fourteenth Century. With the decline of the Sao confederation, Makary was an independent kingdom, one of the Kotoko kingdom city-states. In the early Fifteenth Century, Makary went from being an ally of King Idris Alooma to being a part of the Bornu Empire, and soon converted to Islam. However, by the late Eighteenth Century, although nominally still part of Bornu, the city states had reasserted themselves, and by 1800 Makary had formed a federation of seven fortified towns under the "prince" ("Mé") of Makary.
In March 1846 Umar of Borno, nominal general of the Bornu sultan Ibrahim, suffered a defeat at Kousséri by the forces of the Kingdom of Baguirmi, itself weakened by attacks from the Wadai Empire. By the 1890s Rabih az-Zubayr was able to move into the power vacuum created by these contending forces and took first Oubangui-Chari, then Baguirmi, and then in 1894 Bornu. This soon brought Makary under Rabih's control. After Rabih was killed by the French in 1900, Makary fell under the German sphere of influence.
Despite the changes in rulers and religion the culture of Makary seems to represent an uninterrupted continuation of the original Sao culture.
Geography.
Makary sits on the delta; however the river bed of the Chari River is dry most of the year, only filling with the onset of the rainy season in July and drying up again by the end of October.

Salma () is a village in northwestern Syria, administratively part of the Latakia Governorate, located northeast of Latakia. Nearby localities include Mashqita and Ayn al-Bayda to the west, al-Haffah to the southwest, Aramo and Slinfah 12 kilometers to the south, and Kinsabba to the north. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Salma had a population of 2,131 in the 2004 census.

Salma is well known for its dry climate and its plentiful clean water. It is situated about 800 meters above sea level. Prior to the Baathist takeover of Syria in the 1960s, Salma was one of the few places in the coastal mountain region to be electrified and connected to a grid.
During the ongoing Syrian civil war, most of Salma's residents fled the village which came under rebel control in December 2012. It is currently on the front line of fighting in Latakia Governorate between rebels and government forces.

Sergei Ovchinnikov (volleyball)

Sergei Anatolyevich Ovchinnikov (; 25 January 1969 – 29 August 2012) was the head coach of the Russia's National Women Volleyball Team. He committed suicide three weeks after the team lost to Brazil at the 2012 Summer Olympics quarterfinals.
Biography.
Sergei Ovchinnikov was trained at the Sverdlovsk sports boarding school, and later played for several Russian volleyball teams: "CSKA-2", "SKA" (Khabarovsk), "Neftyanik" (Yaroslavl), "Oktan" (Novokuybyshevsk) and "Neftyanik" (Ufa).
Sergei's coaching career began in 1998 when his former teammate Sergei Shlyapnikov invited him to join the coaching staff of "Neftyanik" (Yaroslavl). As an assistant coach, he was responsible for scouting young players. In 2001, he joined the staff of "Neftyanik" (Ufa).
On February 15, 2004, Ovchinnikov was appointed head coach of the "Avtodor-Metar" women's volleyball team in Chelyabinsk. This was his first assignment as a head coach and a change from men’s volleyball to women’s volleyball. During the 2005–2006 season, Ovchinnikov managed to qualify the Chelyabinsk team for the Super League, and was invited to "Dynamo Moscow", the best Russian team at the time, as an assistant coach. Under Ovchinnikov, the team became the champion of Russia in 2006.
The 2007–2008 season saw Ovchinnikov become the head coach again for the "Dynamo"'s farm club – "Dynamo RGSU". Under his guidance, the team obtained the best result ever and took third place in the Premier League "A".
The 2008-2009 season which Ovchinnikov spent coaching "Fakel" (Novy Urengoy) was not a favorable season for him. From the very beginning of the championship, accidental injuries sustained by key players of "Fakel" constrained them from actively participating in the games until the team left the elite division. Though Ovchinnikov was requested to remain coaching "Fakel", he preferred coaching "Omichka" (Omsk). Before he started working with the Omichka team, Ovchinnikov performed well in the national team as an assistant head coach to Vladimir Kuzyutkin. During the quarterfinal playoffs, "Omichka" clashed with "Dynamo" (Krasnodar) and they lost with their rivals winning “bronze” that year under the guidance of Yuri Marichev.
Marichev, at that time, headed both teams from Krasnodar (Men’s and Women’s) at once. After the end of season, he returned to the men’s squad and Sergey Ovchinnikov was offered to head women's team. In the 2010–2011 season, under his guidance, the Krasnodar women’s volleyball team won medals in all the tournaments in which it participated: "silver" in the Cup of Russia, "silver" in the CEV Cup and "bronze" in the Russian League.
On 11 February 2012, Ovchinnikov was appointed head coach of "Dynamo Moscow". Under his leadership, the team won the silver medal of the Russian Championship 2011/2012.
In 2011 Sergei Ovchinnikov led the student team of Russia, which became the bronze medalist of the World Summer Universiade.
On 21 October 2011 Sergei Ovchinnikov was appointed acting head coach of Russian women's volleyball team. Two months later, on 14 December 2011, Sergei Ovchinnikov was officially confirmed as the head coach of the team. Under his leadership the team took the 1st place in the World Olympic Qualification Tournament, which was held in Tokyo on 19–27 May 2012.
On 29 August 2012, 43-year-old Sergei Ovchinnikov was found dead in his hotel room at his team's training camp in the Croatian town of Poreč. Croatian police, after examining the place of the tragedy, found no evidence of foul play, and concluded that it was a suicide. The reason for the suicide remains unknown, although it was pointed out that Russian media heavily criticized Ovchinnikov for the failure at the Olympic Games in London, where his team was considered as the leading medal contenders but lost in the dramatic quarter-finals to eventual winners Brazil after squandering six match points. Media reports blamed Ovchinnikov's lack of top-level international experience as the main reason for losing to Brazil. "I could see his reaction after that loss," Vladimir Alekno, a head coach of the Russian men's volleyball team, told to the media. "He took it very personally. He was very hard on himself."
On 6 September 2012, Ovchinnikov was buried in his home city of Yaroslavl. Coincidentally, his funeral took place a day before the first anniversary of the air crash that killed the city's hockey team. The Russian Volleyball Federation announced that it would organize a children’s tournament in memory of Sergei Ovchinnikov.

National Cultural Heritage Act

The National Cultural Heritage Act (with the designation of Republic Act No. 10066) is a law, or Republic Act, of the Republic of the Philippines. It created the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property and took other steps to preserve historic buildings that are over 50 years old. It was signed into law on March 25, 2009.
It was passed in response to the 2000 demolition of the Manila Jai Alai Building.
The Philippine Registry of Cultural Property registers all cultural properties of the country, which the National Commission for Culture and the Arts is mandated to establish and maintain through the appropriate cultural agencies and local governments.
A house that has significant importance to the Filipino culture is declared to be a "Heritage House" by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), previously known as the National Historical Institute. Historical markers are placed on the houses by the commission to indicate their significance, Ancestral homes that have figured in an historic event, house such as the "Bonifacio Trial House" in Maragondon, Cavite, or houses of national heroes of the Philippines like the "Juan Luna Shrine" in Badoc, Ilocos Norte are included among the categories "National Shrines" or "National Historical Landmarks".
The act also requires:
The act defines "cultural property" as "all products of human creativity by which a people and a nation reveal their identity, including churches, mosques and other places of religious worship, schools and natural history specimens and sites, whether public or owned, movable or immovable, and tangible or intangible."
The citizen retains the ownership of the house; the government is only declaring the heritage value of the structure and providing funding for its protection and preservation.

Wheel in the Sky

"Wheel In The Sky" is a song by the American rock band Journey, recorded in 1978 and included on their fourth studio album, "Infinity." It was written and composed by Robert Fleischman, Neal Schon and Diane Valory.
At the time of the song's composition, the band had decided to follow a new direction into an edgier sound and began recording simple hard rock pieces with new lead vocalist Fleischman, who was replaced by Steve Perry by the time work on their next album began in earnest.
"Wheel In The Sky" reached #57 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978, becoming Journey's first song to chart on the Hot 100, and also reached #45 on the Canadian RPM 100.
Structure.
The song opens with a short instrumental that lasts for 28 seconds. Perry then sings the first verse, which is followed by the chorus, and the second verse with the chorus repeated once again. Neal Schon joins the song with a guitar solo which is filled with Perry's vocals, which can be briefly heard in the background. Finally, the chorus is repeated four times before the short outro that closes the song.
Lyrics content.
The song's lyrics are sung from the point of view of a lovelorn man who is attempting to reunite with the girlfriend he left behind in an unknown location. He is traveling along the roads to reach her, and get home in the gamble. The refrain refers to a "wheel in the sky" that "keeps on turning" and, in the narrator's words, also "keeps me yearning;" in the refrain, however, he complains, "(I) don't know where I'll be tomorrow." This means that the wheel in the sky itself can be viewed as a metaphor for fate, chance, happenstance, or any other random element that causes both the narrator's future and his destination to defy his efforts to predict either.
The narrator is hopeful that the girl with whom he is attempting to reunite "holds on a little longer," but he finds his a difficult and discouraging trip, admitting at one point, "I can't take this very much longer." He endures rough weather (being "stranded in the sleet and rain," for example) and remoteness, referring to a "dusty road" he follows.
No music video was ever shot for "Wheel In The Sky."
In popular culture.
Movies and television.
The song can be heard blaring in the background of the closing scene of HBO's "The Sopranos" season 2, episode 23 "Bust Out," and also in the third episode of the second season of "Supernatural."
Note.
1.The wheel in the sky can also be equated with the wheel Ezekiel is described as having seen in the Old Testament book about him.

Bird Island Nature Reserve

Bird Island Nature Reserve is situated 1.4 kilometres off the coast, near Budgewoi in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. It can be seen from the Norah Head lighthouse. The island reaches a height of around 20 metres above sea level, and the prominent rocky cliffs make access difficult by boat. The island was once part of the Australian mainland, however it separated four to six thousand years ago with rising sea levels. The geology of the island is sedimentary rocks from the Sydney Basin. The island is roughly circular in shape, not more than 250 metres long at any point. The official website states a size of 7.2 hectares, but another source suggests a more likely 4 hectares in size.
Fauna.
No introduced animals have been recorded on Bird Island Nature Reserve.
Birds.
Over twenty types of birds have been recorded on the island. Up to 7,000 pairs of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Short-tailed Shearwaters breed on the island. The Sooty Oystercatcher is listed as a threatened species. Other birds include, Ruddy Turnstone, Eastern Curlew, Whimbrel, Bar-tailed godwit, Red-necked Stint, Arctic Jaeger, Caspian tern, Common Tern, White-fronted Tern, White-faced Storm Petrel, Eastern Reef Egret, Little Penguin, Black Cormorant, Little Black Cormorant, White-breasted Sea Eagle, Whistling Kite and Little Tern. Land birds such as the Australian Raven, Little Grassbird and Welcome Swallow have been recorded. A pair of Peregrine Falcons breed on the island; their main food consists of young White-faced Storm Petrels.
Lizards.
Two types of lizards have been recorded, an unidentified skink and the Jacky Lizard. The Jacky Lizard has an unusual pink mouth. No terrestrial mammals or amphibians are known here.
Flora.
Two types are recognised. A low open heathland with Tree Broom Heath, an unusual variety of the Sydney Golden Wattle, Tuckeroo, and the Coastal Tea Tree. The flora on the more exposed areas has pigface, a tussock grass and a long stalked form of Lomandra.
Weeds.
Despite the island's isolation and very few visitors, weeds are present. They include bitou bush, prickly pear, inkweed and trad. Bitou Bush is affected by disease. The prickly pear can spread and diminish the area for bird's nesting sites. However, control has been sought with the use of the cochineal insect.
Aquatic life.
The shallow waters near the island support Blue Groper, Port Jackson Sharks, Stingrays and Cuttlefish. Reef fish and many other creatures may be found in the gutters and caves near the rocky shores. Dolphins, seals, turtles and other large animals may be seen near the island. Humpback Whales swim near the island during their annual migration to and from Antarctica.
Shipwrecks.
A number of shipwrecks occurred at or near Bird Island. They include the "Adelaide" and "Allenwood".

George Museum

George Museum is a cultural history museum located in the town of George, Western Cape, South Africa. It preserves the history of the town of George with a special focus on the timber industry. It also houses an art collection.
The museum was started by Charles Sayers, in 1967 in a single room in Courtenay Street. The museum is now housed in the building the first magistrate, Adrian van Kervel built as the Drostdy (residency) from 1812 -1815. 
History.
Background of the George Museum.
What the visitor sees in the George museum today has grown from the private collections of one man, Charles Sayers. He was the owner and long-time editor of the George & Knysna Herald, a newspaper established by his parents in 1881. Sayers collected and preserved all aspects of his hometown's history, with a specialist interest in old mechanical musical instruments.
In 1967 he opened his "Mini Museum" to the public, housed in a single room adjoining a café in Courtenay Street. The people loved it and much encouraged by local authorities he moved to the first George Town House – the administrative building next to the market square which dated back to 1847. By now the Sayers Museum had attracted the attention of officialdom and barely six months after the move it attained provincial aided museum status as a fully-fledged cultural history museum for the region, with indigenous timber and its allied industries as its main theme. The growing popularity led to another move, this time to the building, which had been the original drostdy (magistrate’s residence and office) in the young town. The original "Mini Museum" has been re-created within the present George Museum.
Adrian van Kervel, the first magistrate built the building in 1812-1815 as the Drostdy (residency). In 1826 it burnt down but was re-built. It became the legendary Victoria hotel in the late 19th century until it was sold to the George Municipality in 1972. In 1976 the museum was established here. The Drostdy or now the museum has amazing exhibitions on display. There are examples of the flourishing local Timber industry, old timber tools, implements, a yellowwood woodcutter’s cottage and an outdoor selection of labeled indigenous trees are on display.
Establishment of George Town.
The town of George relates to its establishment based on the timber industry. From the beginning of European colonization in South Africa in 1652, timber and the provision of various woods was of paramount importance for the survival of the settlers. Once forest areas near the present Cape Town were exhausted, the search for more timber continued east along the coast. The great forests of the Southern Cape were discovered as early as 1711, but due to their inaccessibility it was only decades later in c. 1777 that the Dutch East India Company(DEIC) established a woodcutters post or “buitepos” where George is today. However, as early as 1772 there was a gradual influx of settlers’ intent on making a living from the forests. In early days the lives and livelihood of the people revolved around the timber industry and the rich forests in the vicinity.
The George Beacon.
In the George Museum foyer is the original George Beacon which was erected by the DEIC in 1785, by the then Governor of the Cape, Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff to strengthen their claim and to deter the English from trying to stake a claim in Outeniqualand. It was proclaimed a National Monument in 1962 and a heritage object in 1992.
Establishment of a new magisterial district.
On 23 April 1811 the Earl of Caledon, Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, issued a proclamation to form a new Drostdy (magisterial district) in Outeniqualand. He proclaimed that the district and the town, where the Landdrost (later known as the magistrate) would reside, be named after the reigning monarch of England, George III.
The Drostdy.
The plans for the Drostdy were drawn up by the surveyor J. H. Voorman of Swellendam. He was also responsible for the layout of the wide streets. Construction started in 1813. The Drostdy was a double storey with thatched wings and linked by a flat-roofed ground floor hall. The building contractor was a certain Trenk. Various accounts describe the building as being H-shaped. The Drostdy, van Kervel’s official office and residence, was completed at the end of 1815.
During July 1826 when Landdrost van der Riet (the 2nd Landdrost) and his family were on vacation, a fire nearly destroyed the Drostdy. Luckily the walls and the hall which is under the flat roof were still standing. The authorities originally intended having the Drostdy rebuilt, but eventually they decided to sell the property and in 1830 it passed into the hands of William Hollett.
One can accept that when Hollett rebuilt the Drostdy, he would have retained that part of the building under the flat roof which was still intact, as well as such walls as were still standing. 
During the years that followed the property often changed hands and no doubt each new owner made his own alterations to the building. The thatched roof made way for one of corrugated iron very early on. The wood of the windows was replaced by steel, existing doorways were closed up, and new ones broken in. Parts of walls were demolished and other walls were erected.
Library and Archives.
Documents, genealogy, photographs, maps, books and newspapers about the history of George are housed here.
Exhibitions.
The George Museum strives to make the community more aware of their heritage and to give them a better understanding of their environment through its exhibitions. The museum endeavors to collect and exhibit assets that portray the cultural heritage of George and surroundings. It traces the history of the town to its origins as a DEIC (Dutch East Indian Company) outpost established in the Southern Cape in c. 1777. It soon became the hub of a flourishing timber industry. The museum’s main exhibition theme of " Indigenous Woods and Associated Industries of the Southern Cape" focusses on the timber industry of the Southern Cape and the role the industry played in the history of George. 
Outdoor Complex: Wood Industry Exhibitions.
The outdoor complex, focussing on the wood industry, consists of plantings of indigenous forest trees, the Timber Museum and a reconstructed yellowwood cottage (c.1910+). This cottage has been furnished according to records of the woodcutters.
From the beginning of colonisation in South Africa, timber and the provision of wood was of paramount importance to the settlers, being used for buildings, furniture, wagons and carts, firewood etc. The Timber Industry Museum focus on the history of the industry and offers an insight into what it was like in the very beginning. On display are an array of woodworking tools that were used for example various axes, grinding stones and the many different kinds of axes that were used.
Exhibitions of local historical significance occupy the main building of the museum.
The Mini Museum is a museum within the Museum. It is designed to recreate an atmosphere of bygone times. The display
contains many of the original pieces painstakingly collected by Charles Sayers (founder of the museum) for his beloved museum. George was a prosperous market town in Victorian times and in the late 19th century it became the legendary Victoria Hotel. Typical bedroom, dining and drawing room furniture from this period make interesting exhibits. A collection of mechanical musical instruments, ranging from Swiss musical boxes of 1796 to Edison phonographs of the ate 19th century and His Master's Voice gramophones of the 1900s is also on display.
Forced Removals in George.
This recently added exhibition focuses on the forced removals that took place in George from 1904 to 1989. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries various laws were introduced in South Africa to remove black communities from land they occupied. This exhibition portrays the communities in George that were forcefully removed and the places of relocation. 
As there is little information available regarding this important part of history, visitors are requested to identify people in the photographs and also to identify role players in the resistance against the forced removals, in order for the museum to recognise and acknowledge these people. By involving the community in the exhibition, and by providing a way to express their feelings it is possible to establish a sense of belonging, local pride and value in the community by acknowledging that they have something which is unique and of value.
By stimulating dialogue and encouraging visitor participation it was possible to acquire valuable information and broaden the scope of knowledge on the subject.
The museum also hosts temporary displays..
The Sayers Hall is now an Art Gallery. Presently, selective works from the collection of the Western-Cape Library Service, featuring prominent South African artists, as well as a collection of 2010 soccer memorabilia, also by South African artist are on view.

Advance Romance

"Advance Romance" is a Frank Zappa song originally from his live album with Captain Beefheart, "Bongo Fury". Other versions of the song can be found on "You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 3", "You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 5", and "Make a Jazz Noise Here". It is a humorous parody of typical love songs and is sung by Napoleon Murphy Brock. "Advance Romance" was commonly played with the song "Carolina Hard-Core Ecstasy" in concert. The song was played from 1975 to 1976 and from 1980 to 1988 making the song one of Zappa's most performed. Almost all of Zappa's lineups after its release on Bongo Fury have played this song in concert.
Lyrics.
The song describes a girl who is very good at pleasing the singer in bed, though she takes advantage of his lust for her and uses all of his money. It's implied that she's promiscuous as the lyrics state "The way she do me boy, she might do you too." She takes advantage of the singer's friends as well, such as the mentioned "Potato head bobby" (which references the main character in another Zappa song, "San Ber'dino") and George Duke with the lyrics "Took George's watch like they always do. (It was a Timex too!)" 
Solos.
In early versions only Zappa had a guitar solo, but as tours went on more and more of Zappa's band would have solos. The simple structure of the song allowed a lot improvisation, so a solo from almost any instrument would fit right in. One solo was named "Jim and Tammy's Upper Room" and was put on Zappa's 1988 instrumental album "Guitar".

South Parish, Cork

South Parish is the name given to both a Roman Catholic parish of Cork City and to the residential area contained in it.
Location.
The parish stretches from Oliver Plunkett Street in the north to St Patrick's Road in the south and from Sharman Crawford Street in the west to Albert Road in the east 
When used to refer to the residential area, the parts north of the south channel of the River Lee are usually excluded as being part of the city centre. Additionally, the areas east of Anglesey Street are often excluded as they are somewhat disconnected from the rest of the area.
History.
The South Parish is one of the oldest inhabited areas of Cork City. Along with Shandon, it was the first area developed outside the city walls. In the oldest known maps of Cork City, there are structures shown in the area.
There was a Danish settlement in the area that is now Frenches Quay, Barrack Street and George's Quay as early as the 10th century AD. In this area, Keysers Hill still bears a name of Danish origin.
The Red Abbey, which is Cork's oldest surviving structure was built in the late 13th or early 14th century. The current Elizabeth Fort was built in 1624 to replace an earlier fort built in 1601.
By 1690, there was significant development in the area, with the streets that are now Barrack St, Evergreen St, Douglas St, Cove St and Sober Lane clearly distinguishable and lined with buildings.
It was in this year that the Siege of Cork took place. Cork was occupied by Jacobite forces who held Elizabeth Fort. They were attacked by Williamite forces from the Red Abbey and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, the only high vantage points in the area. This siege led to significant damage to buildings in the area, such as the Red Abbey, which was never used for religious purposes again and St Nicholas Church, which was not rebuilt until 1720.
In 1726 all but a small area of the South Parish designated as 'Gardens' was built up and by 1750, the development of the area was complete, with any new buildings just replacing existing buildings.
The present South Chapel (St. Finbarr's South), the Roman Catholic parish church was built in 1766. The Church of Ireland church, St Nicholas, was rebuilt again in 1850, although this is now deconsecrated with parish duties merged with the parish of St Fin Barre's cathedral

Mike Lofgren

Mike Lofgren is an American who is a former Republican U.S. Congressional aide. He retired in May 2011 after 28 years as a Congressional staff member. His writings, roundly critical of the Republican Party, were published after his retirement and garnered widespread attention.
Personal life.
Lofgren has a B.A. and M.A. in history from the University of Akron. He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study European history at the University of Bern and the University of Basel in Switzerland. He also completed the strategy and policy curriculum at the Naval War College.
Political career.
Lofgren began his legislative career as a military legislative assistant to then Republican House representative John Kasich in 1983. In 1994, he was a professional staff member of the Readiness Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. 
From 1995 to 2004, he was budget analyst for national security on the majority staff of the House Budget Committee.
From 2005 until his retirement in 2011, Lofgren was the chief analyst for military spending on the Senate Budget Committee. 
Since his retirement, Lofgren has written about politics, budgets, and national security issues. His work has appeared in the "Los Angeles Times", "Washington Monthly", "Truthout", and CounterPunch.
Writings.
In September 2011, Lofgren published an essay entitled "Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult" on the website "Truthout". In it he explains why he retired when he did, writing that he was "appalled at the headlong rush of Republicans to embrace policies that are deeply damaging to this country’s future; and contemptuous of the feckless, craven incompetence of Democrats in their half-hearted attempts to stop them." He charged that both major American political parties are "rotten captives to corporate loot", but that while Democrats are merely weak and out of touch, the Republican Party is "becoming more like an apocalyptic cult". He particularly described Republicans as caring exclusively about their rich donors; being psychologically predisposed toward war; and pandering to the anti-intellectual, science-hostile, religious fundamentalist fringe. Lofgren wrote that the Tea Party is "filled with lunatics" and that lawmakers used the "routine" vote to raise the debt limit—which Congress has done 87 times since the end of World War II—to create "an entirely artificial fiscal crisis". The essay received widespread media attention because of Lofgren's status as a long-term, respected Republican civil servant. "Truthout" reported the piece received "over a million views". 
Lofgren called the reaction to his essay "bewildering", saying he wrote it not to settle scores, but because he felt he had a uniquely privileged view of the machinery of government which Americans deserved to know about. He added that he'd had "a good career" and no personal problems on Capitol Hill. 
In 2012, Lofgren published the book "The Party Is Over: How Republicans Went Crazy, Democrats Became Useless and the Middle Class Got Shafted", receiving a starred review from Booklist, which described the book as a "pungent, penetrating insider polemic". The "Washington Post" called it "forceful, hard-hitting and seductive". "I wrote the book", he said in a 2012 bookstore appearance, "because I am a concerned citizen." 
Since the publication of his book, Lofgren has appeared in various news media, discussing a number of issues regarding the Republican Party and current American politics.

Eddie &amp; the Gang with No Name

The Eddie & the Gang with No Name series is a trilogy of young-adult novels, written by Northern Irish author Colin Bateman. The trilogy surrounds a twelve-year-old Eddie and his affiliation with a local gang, the "Reservoir Pups". The trilogy was bought by the publisher Random House for release in America. However, given the drug-related content in the third installment of the series, Random House decided to publish only the first two novels.
"Reservoir Pups".
Reservoir Pups (also known as Running with the Reservoir Pups) is the first novel of the "Eddie & the Gang with No Name" trilogy by Colin Bateman, published on 13 November 2003 through Hodder Children's Books. It is Bateman's first young-adult novel.
Plot.
Eddie's father leaves his mother to run away with her boss, a doctor. His mother finds herself a new nursing job at the Royal Victoria Maternity Hospital, however it's located in a run-down section of Belfast; the pair move there regardless. A short time after they arrive, Scuttles, the chief of hospital security, accuses Eddie of scamming the locals and of being part of a neighbourhood gang, the "Reservoir Pups", for which his mum scolds him also.
Given that all the people in his life believe he is already part of the gang, Eddie decides to join. He is tasked with stealing the security codes from Scuttles' computer and while attempting to do so, hears of a plot to kidnap twelve babies from the hospital nursery, abandoning his mission. Returning to the gang, Eddie is ostracised for his failure to complete his task and he is told to "watch his back". Eddie then sets out to foil the kidnapping himself.
"Bring Me the Head of Oliver Plunkett".
Bring Me the Head of Oliver Plunkett is the second novel of the "Eddie & the Gang with No Name" trilogy by Northern Irish author, Colin Bateman, published on 13 May 2004 through Hodder Children's Books. The story was initially written in 1995–96 as a feature film script aimed at adults. It was sold in 1996 although, , no further information has been released. When Bateman was attempting to write the sequel to "Reservoir Pups", he found this script, "threw most of it out"; and re-aimed it at the young-adult audience.
Plot.
Two runaway orphans, Pat and Sean, witness the theft of Saint Oliver Plunketts head from St. Peter's Church where it was on display for a forthcoming papal visit. Pat speaks to the primate of the church and discovers that he will be greatly embarrassed by the disappearance; Pat decides to help as he is feeling guilty for not preventing the crime initially. The orphans enlist the help of Eddie and his best-friend Mo in their task. Eddie and Mo, meanwhile, have been involved in some tasks for the Reservoir Pups which coincidentally involve the son of Scarface Cutler; a blind boy named Ivan and son of the thief in possession of the head.
"The Seagulls Have Landed".
The Seagulls Have Landed is the third novel of the "Eddie & the Gang with No Name" trilogy by Northern Irish author, Colin Bateman, published on 19 May 2005 through Hodder Children's Books. Random House decided not to publish the book in America due to the drug-related content in this instalment of the series.
Plot.
Eddies loses his newborn half-brother and enlists his gang with no name to help him find him. In doing so Eddie discovers that a gang named "The Seagulls", which is the nickname for a large number of immigrants fleeing a natural disaster, are distributing a highly addictive drug called Crush. Eddie and his gang try to stop them whilst finding his lost brother in the process.

Rho Piscium

Rho Piscium (Rho Psc, ρ Piscium, ρ Psc) is a yellowish white F-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of +5.35. It is approximately 85 light years from Earth. The star's age is estimated to be 1.4 billion years but is certainly no less than 600 million years and no greater than 1.9 billion years.
Rho Piscium is moving through the Galaxy at a speed of 8.4 km/s relative to the Sun. Its projected Galactic orbit carries it between 23,500 and 32,900 light years from the center of the Galaxy.
Rho Piscium will come closest to the Sun 2.7 million years from now when it will brighten to magnitude 3.41 from a distance of 34 light years.
Naming.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Official in Charge of the Pasturing", refers to an asterism consisting of refers to an asterism consisting of ρ Piscium, η Piscium, π Piscium, ο Piscium and 104 Piscium. Consequently, ρ Piscium itself is known as (, .)

Maisie Goes to Reno

Maisie Goes to Reno is the eighth film starring Ann Sothern as Maisie Ravier, preceded by "Swing Shift Maisie" and followed by "Up Goes Maisie". John Hodiak plays her love interest in this 1944 romantic comedy.
Plot.
Overworked World War II riveter Maisie Ravier (Ann Sothern) becomes irritable and starts involuntarily winking at people, so the factory's doctor prescribes a two-week vacation with pay. She runs into her friend and bandleader Tommy Cutter (Chick Chandler), who wants her to sing for two weeks in Reno.
When she goes to the bus station, she encounters Sergeant Bill Fullerton (Tom Drake), who is also going to Reno. He wants to stop his wealthy wife, Gloria (Ava Gardner), from divorcing him. When his leave is canceled because his unit is relocating, he begs Maisie to deliver a letter to Gloria in person.
In Reno, blackjack dealer "Flip" Hennahan (John Hodiak) knows where Gloria is staying and drives Maisie to the isolated resort. However, Maisie is fooled into believing that Gloria's private secretary, "Wini" Ashbourne, is Gloria. Wini and Gloria's business manager, Roger Pelham (Paul Cavanagh), want the divorce to go through for their own (never explained) reasons. They get J. E. Clave (Bernard Nedell) to forge another letter to give Gloria the impression that Bill only married her for her money.
In between her blossoming romance with Flip, Maisie discovers she has been duped and sets out to get evidence to convince Gloria that she is being manipulated. She obtains a blotter on which Clave practiced his forgery, but Clave finds out and the crooked trio retrieve the evidence and burn it. Meanwhile, the confused Flip starts thinking that Maisie is having a nervous breakdown.
When Bill telephones Maisie, she strongly urges him to come to Reno before it is too late. Meanwhile, she enlists love-smitten hotel bellboy Jerry into helping kidnap Gloria. She gets caught, but Flip convinces the police that Maisie is not in her right mind and has her released into his custody. When Bill shows up, however, Maisie rushes off with him to the courthouse, where husband and wife are reunited and everything is sorted out.

Nano-PSI

Nano-PSI is a plasma device at the FOM - Dutch Institute For Fundamental Energy Research (FOM-DIFFER). It is used for experimental research at the junction of plasma physics and materials science. 'PSI' stands for Plasma Surface Interactions, while 'nano' has been chosen to stress the mission of the device to synthesize various nanostructures. Nano-PSI is the newest addition to the family of plasma generators at DIFFER, that also hosts the Magnum-PSI and Pilot-PSI linear devices.
The plasma is created by a Cascaded Arc Plasma Source, which exhausts into the spherical vacuum vessel. Gases such as Helium, Nitrogen, Argon, Xenon can be used to create plasma. Samples are mounted in direct view of the plasma. The plasma species interact with the atoms of the sample, leading to surface modifications. In general this process is called plasma processing.
A Langmuir probe can be used to determine the plasma parameters, such as density and temperature. The substrate holder can be electrically biased to attract desired quantities of ions or electrons. Besides, it is possible to heat or cool the sample to a given temperature during operation. Large transient heat fluxes can be created when the plasma source is coupled to a capacitor bank.

Wasted is Mark Johnson's memoir. As a child, he was severely mentally and physically abused by his father. When Mark escaped from where he lived, he turned to drugs and crime. His autobiography provides an account of his journey from self-destruction to self-fulfillment.
Born in the West Midlands in 1970, Mark became a prolific offender and embraced a lifestyle of consuming drugs and alcohol. When he escaped from his chaotic lifestyle, he set up a tree surgery business, which employed several ex-offenders and recovering addicts. Mark earned The Prince's Trust Young Achiever of the Year Award.
Plot.
The story commences when Mark is a child. He lives with his parents as well as his brother, Shane, and sister, Kelly in Kidderminster. Shane is two years older than Mark. Mark's parents also adopt a boy named Paul. Mark's father is an aggressive alcoholic who regularly subjects Mark as well as his wife to mental and physical abuse. According to Mark, his dad never lays a hand upon or raises his voice towards Kelly. This causes Mark to resent her. Mark describes how he grows up in a house filled with anger and tension. Despite his father's horrific treatment of his son, young Mark loves his dad and sees his father as his hero. Mark sees his dad as being scary when he loses his temper. When his dad beats him with a belt, Mark describes how he becomes detached from the situation and feels as if part of him is somewhere else.

<doc id="36871373" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36871373" title="Henry Nock">
Henry Nock

Henry Nock (1741–1804) was a British inventor and engineer of the Napoleonic period, best known as a gunsmith. Nock produced many innovative weapons including the screwless lock and the seven-barrelled volley gun, although he did not invent the latter despite it commonly being known as the Nock gun. He was a major supplier to the military during the Napoleonic wars. His high quality duelling pistols and double-barrelled shotguns were much sought after and it is largely through Nock that the latter became the weapon of choice for hunters.
As well as supplying the military and civilian markets, Nock made expensive pieces for the aristocracy and royalty and was an appointed gunmaker to the king. Nock's business eventually became Wilkinson Sword, a company which today makes razor blades and other shaving equipment, and, until very recently, made ceremonial officer's swords for the British Army.
Guns.
Nock produced many innovative weapons. In 1793 he made a double-barrelled pistol with a removable stock for the Royal Horse Artillery. However, this weapon was impractical with the stock removed and was usually used as a carbine. In 1797 Nock put into production a 9-inch pistol (pattern 1796) for heavy dragoons with a calibre matching their carbines. Some of these pistols had a novel lock designed by Nock, originally intended for an abandoned musket design requested by the Duke of Richmond in 1786 while serving as Master-General of the Ordnance. The new lock could be dismantled by removable pins rather than the previous more cumbersome and time-consuming screws. The pattern 1796 had no butt-plate and the ramrod was stored in the holster rather than attached to the barrel. This feature made it unpopular with users and many guns were modified to take a conventional swivel ramrod.
The name of Nock is perhaps best known today for the multi-barrelled Nock gun due to it being featured in several films. These include uses of this volley gun by the characters Patrick Harper in "Sharpe" and Jim Bowie in "The Alamo". Nock was the manufacturer, but not the inventor, of this weapon. Despite its portrayal in film, this weapon was not very practical as a hand weapon due its very severe recoil, often causing injuries, and the time needed to reload the seven barrels. It was necessary to abandon the rifling of the early prototypes and reduce the charge to keep this problem manageable. Intended as a naval weapon fired from the rigging to repel boarders on the deck, it was retired by the Royal Navy in 1804. Nock also produced some experimental rotating multi-barrelled guns to fire one barrel at a time.
In his own day, Nock was most well known for his double-barrelled shotguns. He was not the first to make weapons in such a format, but their high quality and Nock's many innovations led to shotguns becoming highly popular as a hunting gun, especially after Nock became gun maker to the king. Nock was also well known for his duelling pistols.
Nock made weapons covering the whole field from pistols to muskets. The great variety is perhaps illustrated by his coach blunderbuss which, like naval pistols, had a more corrosion resistant brass barrel. Such weapons were intended to be used at short range and did not take a large enough charge to require iron barrels. Nock continued to innovate until his death - late in life he was making breech loading muskets.
Career.
Nock started out as a locksmith, but he took out a patent for a gun lock in 1775. Nock was not yet enrolled in the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers and could not trade under his own name. He formed Nock, Jover & Co. with William Jover, a Master of the Gunmakers Company and the patent bore Jover's name as well as Nock's along with one John Green. War with the American colonies provided a strong market for Nock's products.
James Wilson came to Nock in 1779 to make the prototypes for his volley gun design. Nock won the subsequent competitive bid for the production of the gun. The weapon is consequently commonly referred to as the Nock gun. Nock also produced some volley guns and volley pistols for the civilian market, including a set for the Royal Household, but in very small numbers.
In 1784 Nock finally became a Freeman of the Gunmakers Company. A few years later the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars ensured that Nock was not short of government business. The Duke of Richmond preferred Nock over his competitors for his innovations, particularly the screwless lock. Nock began delivering muskets in 1792 but orders for the regular army dried up because Nock's non-standard design took too long to make and used a different calibre ammunition. Thereafter Nock concentrated on supplying muskets to local militia preparing for an expected invasion. In 1804 the government placed a contract with Nock to replace all the Nock locks on their stock of Duke of Richmond pattern muskets with standard ones. Although the Nock locks were recognised as being superior, the need for standardisation took precedent.
In 1802 Nock became a Master of the Gunmakers Company.
Legacy.
A nephew of Henry, Samuel Nock, was an apprentice under him. Samuel also proved to be inventive, holding a patent himself. Samuel became Gunmaker-in-Ordinary in succession to George III, George IV, William IV and Victoria and in 1836 became a Master of the Gunmakers Company. However, Henry Nock's own business was continued by his foreman and son-in-law James Wilkinson. Wilkinson became Gunmaker-in-Ordinary to the king in 1805. Contracts with the East India Company ensured the success of the business. The name became James Wilkinson & Son around 1818 when James' son Henry joined. Henry died in 1864 but the company continued making firearms and bladed weapons and became known as Wilkinson Sword. A series of new laws in the UK, starting with the Pistols Act 1903, restricted the sale of firearms to the public. This pushed the company into changing direction and they henceforth concentrated on razor blades and other domestic products. They continued to produce swords for the British Army and for royal ceremonial purposes until 2005 when the sword manufacturing plant in Acton, West London, was closed. The company continues to make shaving and gardening products.

Richard Woleman

Richard Woleman or Wolman (died 1537) was an English churchman, Archdeacon of Sudbury from 1522; and the Dean of Wells between 1529 and 1537.
Life.
In 1478 Wolman was a member of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He also studied abroad, being noted in the Oxford register as doctor of the civil law "of an university beyond the seas". He was principal of St. Paul's Inn, in the university of Cambridge, in 1510, and was made doctor of canon law in 1512. On 31 October 1514 he was admitted an advocate, and on 9 April 1522 collated to the archdeaconry of Sudbury. In 1524 he became vicar of Walden, Essex, and on 26 July of the same year canon of St. Stephen's, Westminster.
Wolman appears to have been resident at court in 1525, and to have been an intermediary with the king, during the absence of Thomas Wolsey, in the matter of ecclesiastical preferments. He was made chaplain to the king Henry VIII in 1526, and a master of requests in attendance at the court, an office involving membership of the king's council. On 4 July 1526 he was presented to the living of Amersham, but he continued to reside at court.
On 17 May 1527 Wolsey sat at his house at Westminster to hear the pleadings in the king's divorce suit. On this occasion Wolman was nominated by the king promoter of the suit. On 5 and 6 April 1527 he took the evidence of Richard Foxe as to Henry's protest against the marriage with Catherine of Aragon. On 31 May he brought forward this evidence and adduced arguments against the dispensing power of the pope. During the proceedings Wolman acted as a secret negotiator between the king and Wolsey. His reward was a prebend in St Paul's Cathedral (25 June) and a third share of the advowson of the first canonry and prebend void in St. Stephen's, Westminster. He is frequently referred to as a canonist of authority by the correspondents of the king and of Wolsey during the divorce proceedings. He was one of twenty-one commissioners to whom Wolsey, on 11 June 1529, delegated the hearing of causes in chancery. He was one of the signatories of the address to Pope Clement VII.
Some time after 29 August 1529, and before 8 November following, when he was elected prolocutor of Convocation, Wolman was appointed dean of Wells. In October 1531 he was incorporated at Oxford. He sat on the Committee of convocation which on 10 April 1532 received the subscription of Hugh Latimer to articles propounded to him. On the following 30 June he was presented by the crown to the rectory of High Hunger (Ongar) in Essex.
When, in October 1532, Henry VIII left England for an interview with Francis I of France at Boulogne, Wolman was one of the council exercising the royal power in London. On 19 March 1533 he was made canon of Windsor, As dean of Wells he signed the acknowledgment of the royal supremacy on 6 July 1534. He cultivated Thomas Cromwell's favour and supported the new queen Anne Boleyn. He signed a declaration, as a doctor of canon law, on the subject of holy orders in 1536. This was put forward in support of the recent religious changes, and bore the signature of Cromwell, as the king's vicegerent, at its head. When the Lincolnshire rebellion broke out, in the autumn of 1536, Wolman was appointed to act on the council of the queen Jane Seymour, during the contemplated absence of the king.
Wolman signed, in 1537, the address of convocation to the king desiring his sanction to the "Institution of a Christian Man". He died in the summer of 1537, and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. He left a sum of money for the construction of a market cross and shelter at Wells, which was erected by 1542. He also founded an exhibition at Cambridge.

Challenge 2 is a 2012 Bengali action film directed by Raja Chanda starring Dev and Pooja Bose in lead roles. The film is not a sequel to the 2009 Bengali film "Challenge"; it contains a very different storyline. Major parts of the movie were shot in Malaysia, Dubai and Mumbai besides Kolkata. "Challenge 2" is a remake of 2011 Telugu film "Dookudu", directed by Srinu Vaitla and starring Mahesh Babu and Samantha.
Plot.
IPS Officer Abhiraj Roy a.k.a Abhi (Dev) is a daring super-cop in Mumbai. He is on a mission to apprehend a mafia don, Guru Nayak (Ashish Vidyarthi), who is involved in illegal drug trade, extortion, and arms trafficking. His father, Debraj Roy (Tapas Paul), who was a politician driven by idealistic values and a sense of social service, met with a fatal accident. It is later revealed that Debraj actually survived the accident but ended up in a state of coma. However, this truth is hidden by their family from the people. Abhi maintains a low profile to catch Guru Nayak. In an undercover operation in Malaysia, Abhi gets hold of Guru Nayak's brother Bunty (Surajit Sen). Later, it is revealed that one corrupt businessman, Apurba Ghosh (Dipankar Dey), was the mastermind behind Debraj's accident.
Abhi falls in love with a girl Pooja Bakshi (Pooja Bose), a fashion designer, who he meets in Malaysia. She is the daughter of Abhi's boss Ajit Bakshi (Rajatava Dutta), a cop who reports to the police commissioner (Bharat Kaul) in Mumbai city. When Debraj comes out of the coma, doctors advise his family that he is at risk if he encounters or hears anything upsetting, disturbing, or shocking. Abhi hides the events surrounding Debraj's accident. He even hides his profession, as it was Debraj's dream to see his son as a politician revered by people. Abhi shifts his family to Debraj's previously abandoned mansion, which is now being used for filmmaking.
Abhi creates a dummy political set-up at this mansion. In the guise of a reality television program, Abhi tricks an aspiring but unsuccessful film actor Swarnakamal (Kharaj Mukherjee), as well as another unsuccessful actor Premjit (Subhasish Mukherjee). Abhi keeps this drama under wraps from his father, by making him believe that Abhi is now an M.L.A. revered by people fulfilling Debraj's wishes. He also gets engaged with his love Pooja, to make Debraj happy. The rest of the plot reveals the politician-criminal nexus behind Debraj's accident and Abhi's retaliation over the political corruptions of the villains.
Release.

Emma de Guzman

Emma C. de Guzman (born: December 8, 1949 in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, Philippines) is a Filipino Roman Catholic widowed laywoman, stigmatist and claimant Marian visionnaire. She is the co-founder of the Catholic lay group association "La Pieta", dedicated to a Marian devotion under the title "Mother of Love, Peace and Joy". Guzman claims to have first seen the Virgin Mary on the Feast of the Nativity of Mary in 1991. 
She is reputedly notable for her alleged Marian visions under trance, particularly the golden dust (Spanish: "Escarchas", English: ""Frost"") which allegedly manifests on her face during her trances. She claims to have communicated with Jesus Christ (only two occasions), Blessed Virgin Mary, various angels and souls seeking penitence and has been observed by various high ranking Filipino Catholic prelates, most notably recorded in photographs and live video apparitions. The group specifically seeks to promote prayer and peace to various nations through any particular Marian devotion.
The La Pieta prayer group, along with its apparition, stigmata, and miraculous events are currently unapproved, though pending investigation by the Holy See. The group is openly tolerated and endorsed by various leading international bishops, including the former Apostolic Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Antonio Franco, Cardinal Jaime Lachica Sin, and Cardinal Francis Eugene George.
History.
Previously in 1984, Emma de Guzman was an impoverished domestic helper in Singapore, and later sought to find work in an overseas nanny housekeeping job in Toronto, Ontario. She is also the mother of three children to whom she worked tirelessly to financially support them.
Emma attributes her first mystical encounter with a whirlwind at a church, where a leaf landed on her foot which bore a piece of paper enlisting a potential job for her in Ontario, Canada.
In Canada, Emma also mentioned that the Virgin Mary taught her how to pray the Holy Rosary, and requested her numerous times to pray them over, and over again through the course of three successive nights. In addition, she claims that the Virgin Mary emphatically immersed Emma's emotions through the various mysteries of the Rosary as if she were actually living each decade.
Emma claims to have met Jesus Christ on two separate occasions. The first occasion was in the old chapel of Our Lady of Fatima in Youngstown, New York, under the guise of an old man. The second occasion was during a trance, to which she claims that Jesus directed her to a copy of the New Testament of the Bible. Many of Emma's followers during her Wednesday group meetings attested to the fragrances and oils which anonymously oozed out of religious statues in the home.
Ecclesiastical endorsement.
Emma de Guzman is known for receiving approbations from various notable Roman Catholic clerics, namely the former Apostolic Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Antonio Franco, Cardinal Jaime Lachica Sin, Cardinal Francis Eugene George, Bishop James Michael Moynihan, Monsignor John Canary, the Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Chicago and Father Clemente Machado, a trained demonic exorcist and priest from the Pontifical Lateran University.
In a circular dated November 18, 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan, authorised by Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez granted an official Imprimatur on the La Pieta house prayer booklet, along with its religious Marian hymns.
On December 2, 2012, the statue of ""Our Mother of Love, Peace and Joy"" endorsed by de Guzman was featured in the "Intramuros Grand Marian Procession", a religious Catholic event sponsored by the Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion and Archdiocese of Manila.
Mountain of Salvation.
Members of the La Pieta Group asked the Archbishop of Batangas Ramon Arguelles permission to pray at the mountains, and requested a Holy Mass which both were authorized and endorsed by the Archbishop. The mountainous site of the apparition was later referred "The Mountain of Salvation" by de Guzman. Two locations were chosen by de Guzman, Cebu and Batangas, which were land donations from her benefactors. The group is also notable for having non-Filipino members, especially among American, Canadian, Polish, and Dutch devotees who travel to the shrine to witness the alleged Marian apparition.
Miraculous claims.
Manifestation of facial golden dust.
According to an Action News 3 New York documentary on Emma's claims of apparition, belief in golden glitters during apparitions date back to 1917, and are commonly referred to as "Escarchas". After obtaining samples of Emma's collected gold dust and compared them to common glitter found in holy cards, electron analysis showed no difference between the two materials yet Emma's golden dust remained the same when exposed to high contents of Hydrochloric acid. Followers of Emma maintains that the glitters appear mysteriously on her face during trances, as recorded in various video recordings. Furthermore, the golden dust collectively amounts on its own, saved on a white sheet where de Guzman sits during her apparition.
Description of the Virgin.
According to Emma de Guzman, the Blessed Virgin Mary has only chosen to appear to her annually on two specific dates, the Nativity of Mary (September 8) and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8) which also coincides with Emma's birthday. An exception occurred in December 2009, when Emma refused to broadcast the message she had allegedly received to the public.
She also notes that the Virgin Mary does not arrive immediately, but is first introduced by singing angels. 
According to de Guzman, the Blessed Virgin Mary wears a full white tunic and has a yellow golden sash and a golden-bordered veil surrounded by light. A statue specific to Guzman's description was made for Marian veneration.
Bodily removal of roses.
On November 4, 1995, during one of Emma's trances to which she allegedly claims to experience the Passion of Jesus Christ, Emma drew out five small, thornless, rose buds out of her chest, filled with blood and bodily mucus. Later accounts of the videotaped event claims a hole on her chest, which later closed.
Writings in ancient Koine Greek.
Followers of Emma also attest to her various letters written in Ancient Greek, containing scriptural passages of the Gospel of Saint John, written under trance. In 2006, Witnesses claim that while Emma was being dictated to write on paper, her eyeline sight was elevated into the ceiling not looking into the writing pad, yet still continued to write a foreign language, in perfect straight lining on paper. Emma claims the writings were given by Saint John the Evangelist, and that she has no previous education in Ancient Greek or any other language, as well as doctrinal or theological knowledge of anything she has written down. At the time of the event, Emma did not have full proficiency in the English language.
A Catholic priest, Father Renato Lopez, reviewed the actual physical letter and ruled that the language in which Emma wrote down was not Classical Greek but Koine Greek, remaining faithful to the timeline in which the Gospel of Saint John could possibly have been originally recorded.
Furthermore, the content of the Gospel of Saint John written down by Emma in Koine Greek refers to the first letter of Saint John, chapter 4:1 which pertains to a warning not to quickly believe any spirit or seer which claims to be from God but rather seek true discernment through prayer.
Mediatrix.
In September 2012, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, Emma stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary revealed her maternal role as "Mediatrix before the Mediator", a special Marian title associated by many Filipino Catholics as in reference to Our Lady Mediatrix of All Graces.
Partial stigmata.
Video recordings of Emma's partial stigmata manifesting include:
Encounter with purgatorian souls.
Emma has also claimed to have met with souls from Purgatory, brought by Saint Magdalena of Pazzi, requesting prayers for the liberation of their souls under the penalty of Seraphic fire.
Encounter with female saints.
Emma claims to have either seen and/or conversed with Saint Magdalena de Pazzi, Saint Bernadette Soubirous, Saint Teresa of Avila, and Saint Faustina Kowalska.
Opposition to the RH bill.
Emma de Guzman, a devout Catholic, publicly opposes the passage of the Reproductive Health bill in the Philippines. On December 8, 2008, she claimed that the Blessed Virgin Mary wept and rebuked politicians and laypersons who do not respect the sanctity of life, as well as to warn that the Reproductive Health Bill as a law will bring forward the suffering and destruction of many souls. In addition, she also opposes the use of contraception and abortion among her followers.
Formal investigation by the Holy See.
Various materials and correspondence were discreetly submitted to the Holy See in 2010 for further research and investigation. The prayer group, "La Pieta House of Prayer", declines to provide any information regarding its submission, contents and correspondence to the general public. The apostolate group claims full obeisance to the Roman Catholic Church and its verdict on the recorded apparitions.

Cascaded Arc Plasma Source

The cascaded arc is a wall-stabilized thermal electric arc discharge that produces a high density, low temperature plasma.
General.
The cascaded arc source, developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology, is shown in the figure below. Compared to plasma sources in other linear plasma generators, this source can produce high-density argon and hydrogen plasmas (respectively formula_1mformula_2 and formula_3 mformula_2) at a relatively low electron temperature (~1 eV). Due to the high collision frequency of the particles in the source, the plasma is in thermal equilibrium and reasonably homogeneous.
The cascaded arc consists of a gas inlet, three tungsten cathodes, cascaded plates, a nozzle and an anode. Via the gas inlet, the working gas -argon or hydrogen- can flow into the cathode chamber. The source is typically running at 0.5 - 3.0 slm (1 Standard Liter Per Minute = 4.4 · formula_5 particles per second) and a discharge current of 100-300 A. The cascaded plates in between the cathode and anode are electrically insulated from each other by 1 mm thick Boron nitride plates. The voltage of these plates is the floating potential. Both nozzle and anode are grounded.

P. M. Røwde

Peter Mathias Bretanus Røwde (23 September 1876 – 21 April 1955) was a Norwegian rubber magnate. Famous for the Viking brand of boots and tires, he established a rubber factory in Askim in 1920 and owned such factories in Mjøndalen and Stavanger. He was also a leader of employer associations, local politician and consul-general for Hungary.
Early and personal life.
He was born in Rovde. In December 1902 in Kristiania he married goldsmith's daughter Ragna Marie Bingen (1881–1972). The couple resided in the 1000 m2 mansion "Voksenhus" at Voksenkollen from 1922. Their daughter, artist Teddy Røwde married Arvid Brodersen, and another daughter married Gunnar Larsen.
Already from childhood he ventured into small-time trade in his home village of Rovde in Western Norway. He moved away from home to work office jobs in larger cities in Western Norway, Ålesund and Bergen, also pondering emigration to the United States where a relative owned a rubber factory. In the 1890s he served his compulsory military service in the King's Guard; he also took commercial education. From 1897 to 1900 he worked as a traveling merchant.
Career in Viking.
He established the wholesaling agency Røwde & Co. in 1900. Among other things he imported Swedish Gislaved rubber products, but he also wanted such products to be produced domestically. In 1906 he established the rubber factory Viking Gummivarefabrik in Heggedal. After it was destroyed in a 1913 fire, Røwde relocated the factory to Askim in 1920. The Viking brand became known for its galoshes and rubber boots, from 1931 also car tires. This factory expanded steadily; damages from a new fire in 1933 were repaired over only eight months. In addition to expanding the factory in Askim, Røwde developed a corporation as he acquired Den Norske Kalosje- og Gummivarefabrik in 1932 and Vestlandske Gummivarefabrik in 1938.
Røwde was a skilled advertiser with a sense of performing media stunts. In the 1930s he displayed a giant tire at a truckstop between Gjersjøen and Mosseveien in Ås. He instituted "the world's largest car race" from Oslo to Askim in 1939 and Rally Viking in the 1950s.
He was also active in employer associations, chairing "Manufakturgrossistenes Landsforening" from 1925 to 1931 and being vice chairman of "Norges Grossistforbund" from 1929 to 1931. He was elected member of Aker municipal council from 1929 to 1931, representing the "non-political electors' list", i.e. a cooperative ballot of the bourgeois parties. The consul-general for the Kingdom of Hungary from 1928 to 1947, Røwde issued a book about Hungary, "Ungarn igår, idag og imorgen" (1938) and also "Kampen om råstoffene" (1936) and "Nye råstoffer" (1942).
He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav (1932) and the Order of Vasa, an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and Commander of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria and the Hungarian Cross of Merit. He died in April 1955 in Oslo.

Dapper ORM

Dapper is an object-relational mapping (ORM) solution for the Microsoft .NET platform: it provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database. Its purpose is to relieve the developer from a significant portion of relational data persistence-related programming tasks. Dapper is free as open source software that is distributed under dual license, either the Apache License 2.0 or the MIT License.
Feature summary.
Dapper's primary feature is mapping from .NET classes to database tables (and from CLR data types to SQL data types). Dapper also provides data query and retrieval facilities. 
Dapper is a micro-ORM: it does not offer the full range of features of a full ORM such as nHibernate or Entity Framework. This is by design. It focuses on simplicity and performance rather than full automation. Dapper does not generate the SQL queries, but only maps the result to Plain Old CLR Objects (POCOs). Third party extensions are available for mapping objects to INSERT and UPDATE queries. It is optimized for usage with .NET 4.0 or higher.
The single class ORM is also available on NuGet.
History.
Dapper was started by Sam Saffron and Marc Gravell because of the N+1 and other performance issues with Entity framework.
Dapper was written for and is used by StackOverflow.

Cemented carbide drawing die

Developmental history.
Cemented carbide was first invented by Germans to make wire drawing dies. In other word, wire drawing die is the direct incentive of the appearance of cemented carbide.
In 1950s, cemented carbide industry grew up in China. Since then, cemented carbide drawing die has been gradually gaining popularity in China. Currently, WC-Co cemented carbide is widely used in China, Japan, Sweden, Italy, etc. In some other counties, rare metal carbides (such as TiC, TaC, NBC, etc.) are added into cemented carbide drawing dies and its manufacturing process is also certainly different.
In China, the Cobalt content in cemented carbide drawing die is basically the same as that in Soviet Union. The traditional grade for cemented carbide drawing dies in China is almost YG8, rarely YG15 and YG6X. Later, in order to obtain better wearing resistance, the Cobalt content has to be decreased. While with the decreasing of the Cobalt content, the impact toughness and flexural strength of the cemented carbide drawing die will dramatically decline. In recent years, the Cobalt content adopted in cemented carbide drawing die area in China is the same as that in Sweden Sandvik which is the leader of cemented carbide industry in the world. At the same time, researchers are trying to improve the performance of cemented carbide by adding rare metal carbides. For example, researchers in Tianjin Cemented Carbide Research Institute add 1% TaC into cemented carbide drawing dies to inhibit grain growth and refine grain size in the sintering process. In result, the service life of this kind of drawing dies is greatly longer than the general grade YG8. In Shanghai Material Factory, the Cobalt content is declined to 6% and a few TaC are added into cemented carbide drawing dies in the sintering process so that the production volume is two times of that of general grade when stretching A3 steel, YIF steel, copper, etc.

Reply 1997

Reply 1997 (; also known as Answer Me 1997) is a 2012 South Korean television series that centers on the lives of six friends in Busan, as the timeline moves back and forth between their past as 18-year-old high schoolers in 1997 and their present as 33-year-olds at their high school reunion dinner in 2012, where one couple will announce that they're getting married. The coming-of-age drama also examines the extreme fan culture that emerged in the 1990s when first generation idol groups such as H.O.T. and Sechs Kies took center stage and K-pop was just blossoming.
It originally aired live on cable channel tvN in 16 episodes (14 30-minute episodes aired back-to-back over a period of 7 weeks, with the last 2 episodes aired separately and lasting 1 hour each due to the amount of material the staff didn't want to edit out). But due to its popularity, the 15th and 16th episodes were also aired simultaneously on Mnet, OCN, O'live, Ongamenet and OnStyle. The last episode recorded the highest ratings at the time for a Korean cable drama, and the series has garnered praise from audiences and critics for being well-researched, refreshing, genuine, and full of humor and heart.
Reception.
The TV serial mostly consisted of idol singers with scant acting experience, and apart from the meta casting of Sechs Kies member Eun Ji-won (who previously worked with director Shin Won-ho and the writing staff on variety show "1 Night & 2 Days"), it premiered to little hype. But with strong word of mouth, it soon gained recognition as a high-quality production with a distinct sense of identity, becoming a buzz-worthy "syndrome" show (Korean slang meaning, a real hit with an ardent fanbase).
With Korean cable shows generally considered successful if they hit 1%, "Reply 1997" took cable ratings by storm, and received an immense amount of attention and critical praise. The show has been credited for its laser-sharp attention to detail, re-creating the late '90s with an accuracy that has fans singing its praises. Endless pop culture references are packed into every minute of the show, with little pop culture easter eggs hidden in scenes, callbacks to the trends of the day, and cameos that are in-jokes.
With majority of Korean dramas shot in the capital Seoul, another of the show's charms is its Busan setting, which is treated in a matter-of-fact way as a locale. The realism is aided by the fact that much of the principal cast is actually from the region, who speak with authentic Gyeongsang dialect. The dialogue also uses time-specific, location-specific slang.
But '90s nostalgia and meticulous attention to detail is only part of the show's appeal. Fans were also intrigued by the clues which the 2012 scenes dropped at regular intervals about who ends up together, as well as the episodes' subtle twists. And its smart, witty way of addressing the growing pains of its adolescent cast makes it just as relevant in the present as it was back in the late-'90s setting of its primary plot. Audiences have lauded the show's intimacy and realism, with a sincerity that connects with people — even those outside that particular generation.
Seo In-guk, Eun Ji-won, Lee Si-eon and Shin So-yul hosted the September 15, 2012 episode of sketch comedy show "Saturday Night Live Korea", which included skits that parody scenes in their series. On September 20, 2012, a special was aired on tvN's "enews" featuring behind-the-scenes videos and a few bloopers from the set.
A novelization was published in January 2013.
Director Shin Won-ho re-edited all 16 episodes for a special director's cut DVD, released in February 2013. It also included 358 minutes of exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, a blooper reel, as well as commentary from the director and actors.
Soundtrack.
The '90s-set drama didn't have an original soundtrack of its own since a huge aspect of the show's mood is set with era-specific music, one of its defining characteristics. So as a thank you to the fans of the show, lead actors Jung Eun-ji and Seo In-guk recorded a 2-part mini OST called "Love Story". Seo was the first season winner of the music audition program "Superstar K", and Jung is the main vocalist of K-pop girl group A Pink. Their duet in Part 1 was a remake of 1990s idol group Cool's "All For You." Their duet in Part 2 is a remake of "Just the Way We Love," from the soundtrack of 1999 film "Love Wind Love Song".
The two singles topped the charts of online music sites including Gaon Single Chart and Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100, and Jung and Seo gave a live performance on Mnet's M! Countdown on September 6, 2012. On September 19th, the song "All For You" won No.1 on New Music Program Mnet KM's Music Triangle.
Due to popular demand, CJ E&M eventually released a "Director's Edition" soundtrack that feature Jung and Seo's 2 covers, as well as '90s songs played throughout the series. It also included a mini photobook and a behind-the-scenes DVD. Before its official release, the album sold out its 12,500 units via pre-order, surpassing the average soundtrack sales figure of 5,000.
Spin-off.
Another series from the same writer and director, "Reply 1994" was produced in 2013. Set in a college campus, it follows the pop culture events of that year, including the emergence of seminal K-pop group Seo Taiji and Boys and the basketball craze of the era. It also starred Sung Dong-il and Lee Il-hwa, but as different characters. Younger cast members Jung Eun-ji, Seo In-guk, Hoya, Lee Si-eon, Shin So-yul, Eun Ji-won, and Lee Jooyeon reprised their "Reply 1997" roles in cameo appearances.
Remake.
An American remake, "Answer Me 1999" is in development at Fox, written by Amy Andelson and Emily Meyer ("Step Up 3D"), with the pilot episode directed by Jon M. Chu.

The Platte River caddisfly ("Ironoquia plattensis") is a small, moth-like insect found in backwaters along rivers in Nebraska. The species was first discovered in 1997 and named in 2000. Upon its discovery, it was thought to be extremely rare.
Following a 12-month assessment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2012 determined the Platte River caddisfly was not suited to be listed as an endangered species. The agency conducted more than 100 surveys and found the insect at 35 sites across a large part of Nebraska, many of which appear to be free from threats.

Highbury Wood

Highbury Wood () is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1983.
The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).
Location.
The site, which is also a National Nature Reserve (NNR), lies in the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The woodlands of the lower Wye Valley are considered one of the most important areas for woodland conservation in Britain.
Wye Valley Woodlands/ Coetiroedd Dyffryn Gwy are recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.
Flora.
The woods are a variety of types which are localised to the particular soils of the area. Most of the woodlands are a rich mixture of varieties and are the same as the original natural woods of the Wye Valley. They include rare and local species and the rarities include Large-leaved Lime, Whitebeam, and other trees close to the edge of their European range such as Hornbeam and Beech.
The wood lies in a matrix of unimproved grassland and other habitats which contributes to making the Wye Valley one of the significantly diverse and most attractive areas in southern Britain. Highbury Wood overlies mostly alkaline soils and contains a range of woodland species such as Ash, Oak and Lime. It also has Whitebeam which is on the western edge of its geographical range.
The ground flora is mostly Bramble, Dog’s Mercury, Bluebell and Wild Garlic. There is a range of rarer species including the Greater Butterfly Orchid.
Fauna.
Two rare molluscs are reported in the wood being "Phenacolimax major" and "Macrogastra rolphi". It is an ideal site for invertebrates and butterflies recorded include the Silver-washed Fritillary.

Song Jong-ho

Song Jong-ho (; born October 5, 1976) is a South Korean actor. Song debuted as a runway model in Park Byung-chul's fashion show in 1995. His print and runway modeling career lasted until 1999, when he turned to acting. He is best known for his roles in "Will It Snow For Christmas?" (2009), "The Princess' Man" (2011), and "Reply 1997" (2012).
Career.
Song Jong-ho majored in Computer Statistics at Pyeongtaek University, but he soon realized that his true passion lay in entertainment. In 1995, he made his debut as a model in a fashion show of designer Park Byung-chul. Song's print and runway modeling career lasted until 1999, when he turned to acting. Song first appeared in sitcoms and television dramas in minor and supporting roles.
In 2007, he drew notice as a surgical intern in the medical drama "Surgeon Bong Dal-hee", for which he received a New Star Award at the SBS Drama Awards. Another notable role followed in the 2009 melodrama "Will It Snow For Christmas?", as a penniless man whose family went bankrupt during the IMF crisis, and thus feels conflicted about falling for an heiress. Song said he cried when he first read Lee Kyung-hee's script, describing it as "so entertaining and sad and it had a lot of great lines," that he begged his manager to get him cast in the drama.
In 2011, Song's profile rose further when he starred in "The Princess' Man", a period drama set in the Joseon Dynasty which drew both high ratings and critical acclaim. In it, he played a nobleman fallen on hard times who betrays his best friend in order to possess the woman he loves and achieve his ambition. This was followed by the popular "Reply 1997", a nostalgic cable drama in which Song played a warm-hearted computer genius-turned-politician loosely based on Ahn Cheol-soo, and was part of the show's central love triangle.
Song returned to the Joseon era in his next two projects. He made his big screen debut in "The Grand Heist" (2012), an ensemble heist comedy about a group of quirky professionals who attempt to steal ice (a valuable commodity at the time) from the royal storage. Then in "The Fugitive of Joseon" (2013), Song portrayed an "uigeumbu", an intelligent and tenacious investigator hunting down the protagonist until he becomes convinced of the latter's innocence and they join forces.
He next appeared in guest appearances on "The Suspicious Housekeeper" (as a stalker) and "The Full Sun" (as the heroine's fiance whose death early in the drama serves as a catalyst). Not long after, Song headlined "The Reason I'm Getting Married", which was featured on the single-episode anthology "Drama Special".

Long Range Patrol Vehicle

The Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) is a six wheeled patrol vehicle used by the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). 
Design.
The SASR's first long ranged patrol vehicles were modified Series II Land Rovers. They were developed in the early 1970s and used in exercises in northern Western Australia from 1973.
The LRPV was developed from the six-wheel drive variant of the Australian Army's Land Rover Perentie design in the late 1980s. The design was intended to be used by the SASR to patrol remote regions of Australia. The LRPV is mechanically simple, and relatively easy to maintain in the field. It has a crew of three. 
The LRPV is fitted with a central ring mount, which can be fitted with either a M2 Browning heavy machine gun or an automatic grenade launcher (AGL). The American Mk 19 was the first AGL to be fitted to the vehicles, but this system was replaced with the German Heckler & Koch GMG in or around 2011. A MAG 58 medium machine gun is also commonly fitted in front of the passenger's (left-hand) seat. In addition, LRPVs can also carry a 250cc motorbike on their tailgate to be used for scouting purposes. 
Service history.
The SASR's LRPVs first saw combat as part of the Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, Operation Slipper. The SASR's 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in November 2001, and rapidly sent LRPV-mounted patrols hundreds of kilometers from their base at Camp Rhino. In his history of the SASR's early operations in Afghanistan, journalist Ian McPhedran wrote that the "Australian-designed LRPVs would prove ideal in the harsh Afghan environment, as they could stay on patrol for weeks on end without needing to return to base". 
On 16 February 2002 SASR Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the LRPV he was travelling in struck a mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. This was the first Australian fatality of the war, and Russell was the first member of the SASR to have been killed in action since the Vietnam War. The two other members of the vehicle's crew were wounded in this incident, and the LRPV was destroyed. As a result of this incident, all of the remaining LRPVs were fitted with a "Survival Enhancement Kit", which comprised armour plates beneath the vehicle and shock-absorbent seats.
The Australian Army ordered 31 Supacat "Nary" special operations vehicles to replace the LRPVs in August 2008 for a cost of $80 million. The project to introduce these vehicles into service was delayed by three years due to problems integrating different systems onto the vehicles, but they reached their 'final operating capability' on 28 June 2012. Several Nary SOVs have been deployed to Afghanistan.

St Thomas' Church, Blackpool

St Thomas' Church, Blackpool, is located in Caunce Street, Blackpool, Lancashire. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Blackpool, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. It was built in 1930–32, designed by the Lancaster architect Henry Paley of Austin and Paley, and cost £10,326 (£ as of ). It is constructed in brick with stone dressings, and has windows with mixed Decorated and Perpendicular tracery. Only the east end of the church and 3½ bays of the nave and aisles were completed. Brandwood and his co-authors consider that the interior is "of dignity and with several inventive touches". Because it was never completed, Hartwell and Pevsner in the "Buildings of England" series describe it as "a stump of a church". It continues to be an active church in the Evangelical tradition.
The vicar is Revd Dr Rosalyn FT Murphy.

Nag Nathaiya (Festival)

Nag Nathaiya is yet another important festival of Varanasi. Nag Nathaiya festival is a part of the Krishna Leela ceremony, a mythological tradition involving depiction of a famous episode in the life of lord Krishna. The Nag Nathaiya festival of Varanasi is held at the Tulsi Ghat. The Nag Nathaiya festival is famous as Nag Nathaiya Leela. The festival celebrates Krishna's conquest of the serpent Kaliya. The Nag Nathaiya festival is held on the fourth tithi of Kartik's light fortnight which is usually sometime between November and December.
History.
This festival was started by Tulsi in 16th century at Tulsi Ghat. The legend of Nag Nathaiya festival can be traced back to the time of Mahabharata. According to an episode of Mahabharata, one day Lord Krishna while playing with his friends lost his ball in the river. When all began asking for the ball little Krishna dived into the river to fetch it back. He dived down deep inside the river. There he was confronted by the poisonous King Cobra, Kaliya. He was feared by the villagers for the terror he spread in the village. The battle went for long but soon Kaliya Nag recognized the strength and power of Lord Krishna. He bowed his head in front of the Lord and promised not to hurt the villagers residing in the village. The snake lifted Lord Krishna on its head and took him to the surface. On the other hand Krishna`s friends became worried as it had been a long time that he went down in the river. Thus the friends were delighted upon seeing him back. It is said that Lord Krishna not only defeated the cobra but also purified the water and the air of the poison that was spread by the nag. The entire episode has since been known as `Krishna Lila` or Krishna`s magical charm.
Celebration of the festival in Varanasi.
When The festival celebrating Krishna's victory is reenacted at Tulsi ghat, a large branch of Kadamba tree is planted at the edge of the river Ganga and the young boy acting as Krishna- who functions in this context not as a mere actor, but as the embodied from (svarup) of Krishna- jumps from the tree branch into the river, where an effigy of kaliya lies in wait. The child embodying Krishna climbs onto the effigy's head and strikes a flute playing pose. Propelled by human assistants, the serpent effigy along with the boy Krishna on its head make a circular sweep in the water, parading in front of thousands of spectators, who watch the display from the river bank or from boats floating on the Ganges waters. The festival is attended by Kashi Naresh (the titular king of Varanasi) every year who views the Leela from royal boat. Later he gives awards to the actors performing in Leela.

LCF II

The LCF II is a single seat Club Class glider, designed and built in the 1970s by German glider club members and intended to be suitable for training, competition and in particular aerobatics. Only one was completed.
Design and development.
Design of the LCF II began in 1971, at the beginning of a decade that saw increasing interest in aerobatic glider flight.The intention was to produce a general purpose club glider, capable of being used as a trainer or in standard gliding competitions but also to able to take the stresses involved in aerobatics. The manoeuvrability required for the latter requires the ability to fly slowly and to rotate rapidly, calling for relatively short spans. The LCF II has a span of 13 m (42 ft 8 in).
The straight tapered, square tipped wings of the LCF II are mounted at shoulder height and built around a single wooden spar. The ribs are formed from polyvinyl chloride rigid foam and the wings plywood covered. The wing mounts Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes, which extend from the upper surfaces.
The fuselage of the LCF II is built around a steel tube structure, covered by glassfibre in front and fabric covered aft, producing a tapering hexagonal cross section from the leading edge rearwards. A long, single piece canopy extends back almost to the leading edge, where it blends smoothly into the upper fuselage line. At the rear the tailplane is attached to the top of the fuselage; the vertical surfaces are straight tapered and square tipped. All rear surfaces are foam filled and ply covered. The LFC II has a fixed monowheel undercarriage, partly recessed into the fuselage, and a tailwheel.
It took five air club members about 4,000 hours to build the LCF II, which made its first flight on 22 March 1975.
Operational history.
In 1975 the LCF II won first prize at the annual meeting of the Oskar-Ursinus-Vereinigung, the equivalent of the Experimental Aircraft Association. Plans were put in place for Scheibe Flugzeugbau to build the LCF II, but no orders were forthcoming and no Scheibe aircraft were constructed. It was intended that the LCF II should also be built by amateurs but it seems that, in the end, the prototype was only example of its type. This aircraft, registered "D-6466", remained on the German civil register in 2010, listed as a Scheibe LCF II.

Mireasă pentru fiul meu

Mireasă pentru fiul meu (literally "A bride for my son") is a Romanian reality matrimonial show produced by Sinevizyon TV Production. The first series started on 29 August 2011 and it is broadcast by Antena 1 channel in Romania. The competition is hosted by singer and TV host Mirela Boureanu Vaida. The show is similar to Noră pentru mama which was broadcast by Kanal D Romania.
Format.
The premise of the show is that there is a group of people (girls, boys and boys's moms) living together in a large, usually specially constructed house. During their time in the house they are isolated from the outside world and are not aware of outside events. Contestants are continuously monitored by in-house television cameras as well as personal audio microphones during their stay. Each series lasts for about 1 year, with 41–45 contestants entering the house to marry.
Launch Day.
On the launch Day, anywhere from upwards of approximately 28 contestants entered the "Mireasă pentru fiul meu" house. In the first season, contestants entered the house in the launch night.
Contestans.
In every season the girls and boys, together with their mothers, grandmothers, (In season 2 Florin entered in the competition with his grandmother Maria and in season 3 Laurențiu entered in the competition with grandmother Maria) stepmothers, (In season 2 Răzvan entered in the competition with his stepmother Elena) aunts (In season 1 Ionuț entered in the competition with his aunt Mariana, but her aunt was replaced by her mother, Niculina in final weeks) or single entered in the "Mireasă pentru fiul meu" house on the Launch Day. In the first two weeks the boys and girls stay in different houses, the boys, in the boys house and the girls, in the girls house with the boys's mothers.
Weekly bride and weekly mother.
Every week one girls and one mother who received the most public votes are declared the weekly bride and the weekly mother. They can be saved from elimination. Also the weekly mother can save his son from elimination.
Nomination and Elimination.
Almost every week, the contestants (except boys) make nominations. In some weeks the mothers nominate one, two or three girls and in the others weeks the girls nominate one or two boys with their mothers. The contestants who received the most nominations are up for elimination during that week. The contestant who received the fewest votes from the public is eliminated from the competition.
Isolation.
"Mireasă pentru fiul meu" contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio or the Internet; they are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). Despite the contestants isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.
Live Final and the winners.
At the beginning of the Live Final, a small number of contestants remained in the house (anywhere from 7 to 11) after surviving numerous eliminations. The public were asked to vote for their favourite surviving couple (bride and bridegroom with bridegroom's mother called mother-in-low) to win a cash prize and be crowned the winners of "Mireasă pentru fiul meu". Voting lines were suspended at intervals during the show to reveal runners-up. Contestants finishing lower than third place, were eliminated without delay and interviewed by the presenter. Once the second runners-up had been revealed, the show took a break, before returning half an hour later to allow the third place contestants to be evicted and interviewed. The winner was then announced. The first runners-up then left the house and was interviewed, followed by the winners, who were usually treated and greeted to a cheering crowd and a firework display before their interview. In Live Final some couples can marriages.
Seasons.
Season 1 (2011).
The debut season started airing on August 29, 2011 and ended on August 25, 2012.In the grand final Ionuț and Monica was married. Edina and Adrian with Mrs. Mărioara was declared the winners of the competition.
Season 2 (2012).
The debut season started airing on September 1, 2012 and ended on August 24, 2013. In the grand final Alin & Andreea and George & Lorena were married. The winners of the second season were Lorena and George with Mrs. Cristina.
Season 3 (2013).
The debut season started airing on August 29, 2013.
History.
The original series started in 2006 and it was broadcast by Kanal D channel in Romania. The series was called Noră pentru mama (literally "Daughter-in-law for my mother") and that show had five seasons. "Noră pentru mama" was presented by TV host Gabriela Cristea. In 2011, after the end of the fifth season Antena 1 adopted this format, releasing a new series called "Mireasă pentru fiul meu" presented by Mirela Boureanu Vaida.

Reach for the Stars (will.i.am song)

"Reach for the Stars", alternately subtitled "Mars Edition" and "NASA Edition", is a song written, produced and recorded by American recording artist will.i.am in commemoration of the landing of the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars. First released on August 28, 2012, the song also appears on the deluxe edition of his fourth studio album "#willpower" (2013). "Reach for the Stars (Mars Edition)" became the first song in history to be broadcast from another planet, completing a journey of more than 300 million miles between Mars and Earth.
Background and development.
"Reach for the Stars" was written in February 2011, after NASA asked will.i.am to write and produce a song for the Curiosity rover's landing on Mars. The songwriter said that the experience with NASA administrator Charles Boden discussing the possibility of broadcasting a song from Mars was "surreal". The song is part of NASA's educational outreach, with will.i.am stating that the song "aims to encourage youth to study science". Rather than produce a song via the computer, will.i.am stated that he wanted to show "human collaboration", which featured a 40-piece orchestra. He added that "people in my field aren't supposed to try and execute something classical, or orchestral, so I wanted to break that stigma, have something that would be timeless and translated in different cultures."
NASA had confirmed during the Mars Science Laboratory launch tweet-up on November 24, 2011 that will.i.am had partnered with NASA to deliver a song for Curiosity's landing. After being uploaded to the rover, which landed near the equator of Mars, the song was broadcast live from the planet, completing a journey of more than 300 million miles (approximately 482 million kilometers). It became the first song in history to be broadcast from another planet and the second song to be broadcast in space, after the Beatles' "Across the Universe" was beamed into space by NASA in 2008.

Heartland virus

The Heartland virus is a novel, tick-borne "Phlebovirus" discovered in northwestern Missouri by Dr. Scott Folk of Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph, Missouri.
The virus first appeared in humans in June 2009 when two farmers, living apart, presented with the following symptoms: fever, fatigue, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.
It is a member of the "Bhanja virus" serocomplex; the recently discovered SFTS virus from China is a related species causing a similar disease.
The virus has been traced by researchers from the CDC and Missouri Western State University back to the Lone Star Tick, which transmits the virus to people when feeding on blood.
Characteristics.
The "Heartland virus" is part of the "Bunyaviridae" family of viruses which contain 3 segments of -ssRNA. The genus of the virus is "Phlebovirus" and the species is the "Heartland virus". 
Transmission.
The "Heartland virus" has been isolated from the Lone Star Tick ("Amblyomma americanum"). The phleboviruses, in general, can be transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and sand flies. Patients in all known cases of the "Heartland virus" in the United States reported being bitten by ticks in the previous 14 days.
Signs and Symptoms.
Fever in excess of 100.4°F (38°C), lethargy (weakness), headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, arthralgia (joint pain), leukopenia (low white blood cells) and thrombocytopenia (low platelets). Elevated liver transaminases may also be present.
Risk Factors.
All known cases reported in the United States have been reported in three states: Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Patients in all currently known cases spent a fair amount of time outdoors in regions where ticks were endemic. And, of these cases, all patients were above the age of 50. All cases occurred from May - September.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis is currently through the elimination of other causes of infectious diseases with related symptoms like Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis; or if the patient fails to respond to treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline. RT-PCR may then be used to detect viral ssRNA in the blood. Antibody titers against the virus may also be used to indicate infection with the "Heartland virus".
Treatment.
Treatment is non-specific. Antibiotics are not useful against viruses. IV Fluid administration and medications for the relief of pain are currently the best options.
Prevention.
Use insect repellents on yourself and your gear. Completely cover your body with long sleeves and pants. Avoid bushy and wooded areas. Perform thorough tick checks after spending time outdoors and remove any tick found immediately. 
If you encounter a tick on your body or your animal, remove the tick by the head. Squeezing the abdomen of a tick while it is attached can force bacteria and viruses into the bite wound. Squishing the unattached tick to kill it can release bacteria and viruses from the abdomen of the tick which may then be able to enter a wound or burrow through skin.

Identity Thief

Identity Thief is a 2013 American crime comedy film directed by Seth Gordon, written by Craig Mazin, and starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy. The film tells a story about a man (Bateman) whose identity is stolen by a woman (McCarthy).
Plot.
Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) is an account processor who gets a call from a woman (Melissa McCarthy) telling him that someone had attempted to steal his identity. She tells him about an identity protection service and asks him for his name, date of birth, and social security number. Sandy gives her his information, but little does he know that his identity is actually about to be stolen. At work, Sandy gets called in by his obnoxious boss, Harold Cornish (Jon Favreau), and told to prepare bonus checks for the company partners worth $1.2 million each. As Sandy goes to do so, he gets a phone call saying he has an appointment at a salon on Friday in Winter Park, Florida. Despite his confusion that he is in Denver, he puts it out of his mind when he has a conversation with his co-worker, Daniel Casey (John Cho), who tells him to meet him in the parking lot. In the parking lot with other employees, Daniel informs Sandy that he and the others are tired of working for Cornish while he and the partners got all the money and they discuss starting their own firm and taking most of the companies clients in Denver with them. Daniel asks Sandy if he'll join them, telling him he is the best at what he does and that he would be paid $250,000 per year if he joined. Sandy then agrees to join Daniel in the new business and later tells his wife who is overjoyed at the news.
Meanwhile, Diana, the woman who had originally called Sandy, ran up a bill to over $2,400 on a fake credit card she had made using the information Sandy had given her, including buying jewellery, a jet ski, and drinks for everyone at a bar in Winter Park, before getting arrested for assaulting the bartender with a punch to the throat and for being drunk in a public place. The next day Sandy tries to get gas using his real credit card, but his card is declined and the gas station clerk cuts it up. He calls the credit card company and is told he's spent a lot of money in Florida. As this happens, he gets arrested. At the same time in Florida, Diana continues splurging with Sandy's money. At a police station, Detective Reilly (Morris Chestnut) tells Sandy that he missed a court date in Florida for assault. They pull up a mug shot of Diana from her arrest and determine she's stolen Sandy's identity. It gets worse at work when Daniel says cops are asking about him possessing drugs. Reilly and other cops show up and say a card with Sandy's name was used to buy drugs from a man named Paolo (Jonathan Banks). When told they can't do anything unless the identity thief was standing there in Denver with them, Sandy offers to go on his own, bring her there and get her to talk to Daniel to clear his name. Sandy's wife, Trish (Amanda Peet), finds out about the situation and knows Sandy's taking a risk, but he assures her he'll get the job done.
Sandy then travels to Winter Park where finds Diana at the salon and follows her. After he confronts her on the highway, she steals his rental car and leaves him with her now totaled Fiat (but takes the keys). After a call from his wife telling him that a debt collection company was looking for him for non-payment for the Fiat, he finds her address in the glove compartment and goes to Diana's house, which is full of merchandise and other stolen credit cards. The pair scuffle and Sandy attempts to handcuff her. Before Sandy can cuff her, two criminals named Marisol and Julian (Génesis Rodríguez and T.I.) are pounding at the door because Diana gave Paolo some bad credit cards. Marisol and Julian shoot the door open, but Sandy and Diana manage to escape out the back door.
Sandy tells Diana about his plan to redeem his name and Diana agrees to go along with him. Meanwhile, a skiptracer (Robert Patrick) is dispatched to track down Diana to obtain a substantial bounty. On the road, Diana reminds Sandy that the people at the airport would have an issue with both of their ID's reading "Sandy Bigelow Patterson" with the same birthdate, so flying back is out of the question and Sandy decides to get them back to Denver by driving. After traveling through several states, the skiptracer catches up to the pair and captures Diana. A chase ensues and she knocks him unconscious, and Sandy rams his van off the road. The van spears off the road and rolls over, but Diana survives with only a bloody nose despite standing up at the time of the accident. After the rental car is then destroyed when hit by a semi-trailer, they flee in the skiptracer's van with him tied with duct tape in the back, but it overheats on the road. They end up walking and almost stop to rest in the woods, but they encounter several snakes, one of which ends up in Sandy's pants, which he takes off and throws away. Another snake bites Sandy's neck and Diana accidentally knocks him unconscious while trying to beat the snake with a stick from their camp fire.
Sandy wakes up at a bus station; Diana says she carried him until she flagged down a truck to take them there. The next bus to Denver isn't due for three days. Sandy then remembers that he has some emergency money in his socks and buys a cheap car. When they stop for gas and realize they need more money, the two of them sneak into Sandy's old accounting firm with Sandy playing Cornish and coax an accounts processor into giving them access into restricted files, where they steal Cornish's identity to create new credit cards (the accounts processor discovers the scam but arrives too late to stop them). Meanwhile, the skiptracer goes to the bus station and threatens the employee unless he tells him where to find Diana. He then gets shot by Marisol who, along with Julian, has been tracking the pair throughout their journey. Having overheard the skiptracer's conversation they continue to pursue Sandy and Diana. Sandy and Diana finally arrive in St. Louis and stop at a hotel. Diana gets a makeover and has dinner with Sandy. Things get heated when he asks Diana what her real name is, but she admits she doesn't know it. She cries as the accounts processor comes in with cops, who arrest Sandy and Diana. Diana manages to un-cuff herself in the back of the police car, and then breaks the back windshield and escapes with Sandy. The skiptracer, who had captured Marisol and Julian by shooting them in the foot and locking them up in his trunk, eventually finds Diana and Sandy on the highway mid-escape, and hits Diana with his car, sending her flying behind it. Although the skiptracer ends up colliding his car with the cops, prompting a horde of police to arrest him, Julian and Marisol. After getting hit by the car, Sandy comes to her aid, but Diana comes to and defensively strikes Sandy in the throat. Diana and Sandy eventually get home, where Diana has dinner with Sandy's family and reconciles with them.
The next morning, Sandy is prepared to tell Diana that he'll go to work alone (and not turn her in), but she's gone. She left a note saying sorry. He goes into work, preparing to quit, but Daniel shows him that Diana is meeting with the police in an office. Detective Reilly tells Sandy he is no longer part of the investigation and Diana is taken away in cuffs. Before she leaves, Sandy asks her why, and Diana says she knew he wouldn't turn her in, but it was the right thing for her to do it herself. One year later, Sandy is celebrating another birthday, this time with his third kid joining them. The family goes to visit Diana in prison, where Sandy presents Diana with a birth certificate of hers that reveals that Diana's true name is Dawn Budgie (which Diana thinks is a "terrible fucking name"). Diana hugs Sandy and begins to walk away, until an officer tells her "Back in your cage, bitch", prompting Diana to strike her in the throat. Another guard tazes Diana in the back. Diana falls, but recovers seconds later. She then gets up, apologizes to the guard she struck, and walks back to go to her cell. The camera takes one more shocked look from Sandy, as he walks away.
Production.
The film was first conceived as a project with two male leads, but that changed when Bateman saw McCarthy in "Bridesmaids" and pushed for her to star alongside him. Jerry Eeten wrote an early draft, later finished by Craig Mazin with a final rewrite by Seth Gordon. In January 2012, Gordon was announced as the director of the film with Scott Stuber producing through his Stuber Pictures banner with Bateman and Peter Morgan for DumbDumb. In April 2012, John Cho, Clark Duke and Amanda Peet joined the cast. In May 2012, Jon Favreau and Morris Chestnut also joined the cast. Naomi Velarde joined the cast in the last week of production. 
Some filming took place in Atlanta at the 191 Peachtree Tower, around May 2012. Scenes were also filmed on Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta, at The Colonnade restaurant on Cheshire Bridge Road in Morningside, and at Perimeter Mall. Scenes from the film were also shot at Salon 2000 in Ansley Mall.
Release.
In March 2012, a release date of May 10, 2013 was announced. In June 2012, the release date changed to February 8, 2013.
Reception.
The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. It holds a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 160 reviews. The site's consensus is: ""Identity Thief"s few laughs are attributable to Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman, who labor mightily to create a framework for the movie's undisciplined plotline". At Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable" reviews.
R. Kurt Osenlund of "Slant Magazine" gave the film a positive review, rating it 3 out of 4 stars, praising McCarthy performance, writing that she "gives a performance leagues better than anything to be expected in a mainstream, early-in-the-year release, padding a typically sketched character with layers of hilarity and pathos. McCarthy owns 'Identity Thief' with a turn of limitless surprise, making an otherwise adequate comedy soar as a star vehicle. She is riveting in simply-penned moments of remorse and confession, adding tearful depth to her ace timing and formidable physical comedy."
In his negative review, Rex Reed controversially made several references to Melissa McCarthy's weight, referring to her as "tractor-sized", "humongous", "obese", and a "hippo". Film critic Richard Roeper said, "This just smacks of mean-spirited name-calling in lieu of genuine criticism." On Twitter, Paul Feig, who directed McCarthy in "Bridesmaids" and "The Heat", wrote, "I cordially invite Mr. Rex Reed to go fuck himself." The review was referenced at the 85th Academy Awards on February 24, 2013 by the host, Seth MacFarlane, who joked that Reed would review Adele for singing "Skyfall" at the ceremony. In a column for "The Huffington Post", Candy Spelling likened Reed's review to bullying.
Box office.
Despite the mostly negative critical reviews, "Identity Thief" opened at #1 at the box office with $34.5 million in its first weekend, all the more remarkable as a major winter storm, often a concern with winter dump months releases, forced theater closings and kept moviegoers at home in the densely populated Northeast. The film held the #2 spot in its second weekend, grossing $27.5 million and only dropping 20.5%. It reclaimed the #1 spot in its third week opening.

Nizam army

Nizam Army was a make up of a number of different military forces. The army was commanded by three different independent commanders. Nizam, Diwan, whom was an important officer in Nizam's government, and Shangal Umara or A.K.A: "Amin Kabir" all lead and maintained their own armies.
In 1892, Nizam signed a treaty with the East India Company concerning the military. After the treaty Nizam did not show any interest in his own Army. At that time the army adopted an alternative name, they were known as the Sharif-E-khas. When Nizam Army participated in the war with Maratas, The army's inability and indiscipline were clearly apparent.
In Diwan's army, different types of soldiers had enlisted. Of these recruits were mainly Arab nationals who had migrated to and then lived in Deccan, and they played a major part. Later, Muslims came from Audh, Sindh, Balochistan etc. of North India and also played an important role to Diwan's army. The name took up the alternative name "Rohollas". In addition to this name, other battalions within Diwan's army were called Line "Walas". Diwan's army was supplied by Europeans for the security of Nizam.
Russell Brigade.
In March, 1811, the East Inda Company had sent Henry Russell to India to be a residing interest for the company there. When he joined a community of Hyderabad, he had identified that the situations in the rural areas were unconscionable. Law and order was in disarray, and Russell had decided that Nizam was not an able ruler. Pindaries, Bhils and Local Zamindars had been behaving like thieves and were looting the people of Hyderabad. But the use of European Battalions were highly restricted according to the treaty that Nizam had made with the East India Company. The European Battalions were meant to be deployed by the East India Company for the purpose and protection of Nizam. So Russel was determined to create new battalions for an effort to normalize the situation in the State. In 1816, the British Government agreed with this and allowed Russell to form his own Brigade, known as "Russell's Brigade" or "Russell's Army". Later, Russell's Brigade became the Hyderabad contingent.

Guardian Angel (album)

Guardian Angel is the sixteenth rock album by British instrumental (and sometimes vocal) group The Shadows, released in November, 1984 through Polydor Records.
Release.
"Guardian Angel" was the group's first album to be released on LP and CD simultaneously and only the group's second CD release. It had the distinction of being the group's 1980's album, consisting entirely of original material, except for one track. The album wasn't promoted with Polydor's marketing machine fully behind it and the album failed in commercial terms, spending just one week at number 98 on the British charts. Also, only two tracks were performed live by The Shadows and then only during the January to March 1985 "down-under" tour in Australia and New Zealand; the two tracks being "How Do I Love Thee" and "Hammerhead".
The album was reissued on CD in December, 1998 on the now defunct See for Miles Records label and added eight tracks, two of which had never been issued on CD before.

Mian Ren (Flour Figure)

Mian Ren is a form of traditional Chinese folk art. Flour figures are made of coloured rice flours, colouring, stone wax and honey. Craftsmen can make lively figures out of the coloured flour balls with a small bamboo knife. They used to carry their tools around villages and towns to sell them for a very basic living. Sometimes flour figures are used in dishes as food crafts - along with vegetable carvings.
Flour figures were considered as little delights not found in elegant imperial staterooms. They are mainly collected by children as toys.
Origin.
The origin of the specific craft is unknown. According to archaeological discoveries figures of humans and pigs were found in the Xin Jiang province tombs. They are considered more than 1,340 years old. In a Southern Song period book called "Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital)", Mian Ren was defined as a food ornament that could be eaten as a snack.

The Act of Killing

The Act of Killing (, meaning "Butcher") is a 2012 documentary film directed by Joshua Oppenheimer, and co-directed by Christine Cynn and an anonymous Indonesian. It is a Danish-British-Norwegian co-production, presented by Final Cut for Real in Denmark and produced by Signe Byrge Sørensen. The executive producers were Werner Herzog, Errol Morris, Joram ten Brink, and Andre Singer. It is a Docwest project of the University of Westminster. It won the 2013 European Film Award for Best Documentary, the Asia Pacific Screen Award, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 86th Academy Awards.
"The Act of Killing" won best documentary at the 2014 BAFTA awards. In accepting the award, Oppenheimer asserted that the United States and the United Kingdom have "collective responsibility" for "participating in and ignoring" the crimes, which was omitted from the video BAFTA posted online. After a screening for US Congress members, Oppenheimer demanded that the US acknowledge its role in the killings. 
The Indonesian government has responded negatively to the movie. Presidential spokesperson on foreign affairs, Teuku Faizasyah, claimed that the movie is misleading with respect to its portrayal of Indonesia. 
Synopsis.
The film focuses on the Indonesian killings of 1965–1966, an anti-communist purge in which more than 500,000 people were killed. When Suharto overthrew Sukarno, the President of Indonesia, following the failed coup of the 30 September Movement in 1965, the gangsters Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry in Medan (North Sumatra) were promoted from selling black market movie theatre tickets to leading the most notorious death squad in North Sumatra. They also extorted ethnic Chinese locals, killing those who refused to pay. Anwar personally killed approximately 1,000 people, usually by strangling with wire.
Today, Anwar is revered as a founding father of the right-wing paramilitary organization Pemuda Pancasila that grew out of the death squads. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers, and they are happy to boast about everything from corruption and election rigging to clearing out peasants for land developers and genocide. A regime was founded on crimes against humanity, yet has never been held accountable.
Invited by Oppenheimer, Anwar and his friends recount and re-enact their experiences and some of their killings for the cameras, and make dramatic scenes depicting their memories and feelings about the killings. The scenes are produced in the style of their favorite film genres: gangster, western, and musical. Various aspects of Anwar and his friends' filmmaking process are shown, but as they begin to dramatize Anwar's own nightmares, the fiction scenes begin to take over the film's form, leading the film to become increasingly surreal and nightmarish. Oppenheimer has called the result "a documentary of the imagination".
While some of Anwar's friends realize that the killings were wrong, others worry about the consequences of the story on their public image. Younger members of Pemuda Pancasila argue that they should boast about the horror of the massacres, because their terrifying and threatening force is the basis of their power today.
After Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue. He says that he feels what his victims have felt. Oppenheimer, from behind the camera, points out that it was much worse for the victims, because they knew they were going to be killed, whereas Anwar was only acting. Anwar then expresses doubts over whether he has sinned or not, tearfully saying he does not want the memories of what he did to come back to him. He revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place, and gags repeatedly. The dancers from the film's theatrical poster are seen before the credits begin to roll.
Production.
In 2001, while conducting interviews for their 2003 film "The Globalisation Tapes", Oppenheimer and Cynn began delving into the Indonesian killings of 1965–66. After moving up the ranks of those involved with the killings, Oppenheimer's interviews led him to meet Anwar Congo in 2005. The film was shot mostly in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, between 2005 and 2011. After seeing an early preview of "The Act of Killing", filmmakers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris signed on as executive producers.
The name "Anonymous" appears 49 times under 27 different crew positions in the credits. These crew members still fear revenge from the death-squad killers.
Reception.
Critical response.
"The Act of Killing" received worldwide critical acclaim. On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 89 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim."
Nick Schager of "The Village Voice" called it a "masterpiece." Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges called the film "an important exploration of the complex psychology of mass murderers" and wrote that "it is not the demonized, easily digestible caricature of a mass murderer that most disturbs us. It is the human being."
In some quarters Oppenheimer has been accused of treating his subjects in bad faith. As far as their goal at the beginning was to glorify mass murder, Oppenheimer responds that could never have been his goal, therefore that side of them may have been betrayed. In an interview with "The Village Voice", Oppenheimer said, "When I was entrusted by this community of survivors to film these justifications, to film these boastings, I was trying to expose and interrogate the nature of impunity. Boasting about killing was the right material to do that with because it is a symptom of impunity."
Australian National University Professor of Asian history and politics Robert Cribb stated that the film lacks historical context. In reply, Oppenheimer said that "the film is essentially not about what happened in 1965, but rather about a regime in which genocide has, paradoxically, been effaced celebrated – in order to keep the survivors terrified, the public brainwashed, and the perpetrators able to live with themselves...It never pretends to be an exhaustive account of the events of 1965. It seeks to understand the impact of the killing and terror today, on individuals and institutions." 
Bradley Simpson, historian at the University of Connecticut and director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, states the "brilliant Oscar-nominated film" has prompted vigorous debate among Indonesians about the crimes and the need to hold responsible parties accountable, and suggests that it could have a similar effect in the United States, whose own role in the killings "has never officially been acknowledged, much less accounted for, though some of the relevant documents have been made available to the public." 
An Indonesian academic, Soe Tjen Marching, analyzed the film in relation to Hannah Arendt's theory of the banality of evil.
The primary subjects in the film, Anwar Congo and Herman Koto, have seen the film and neither feels deceived, according to Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer says that upon watching the film Anwar Congo "started to cry...Tearfully, he told me: 'This is the film I expected. It's an honest film, a true film.' He said he was profoundly moved and will always remain loyal to it." A subsequent interview on Al Jazeera's program "101 East" revealed that Anwar had misgivings about the film and the negative reaction to it in Indonesia, which was causing problems for him. He confided these concerns directly to Oppenheimer in an apparent Skype conversation displayed within the program.
Top ten lists.
"The Act of Killing" has been named as one of the best films of 2013 by various critics:

<doc id="36872435" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36872435" title="Racism in the LGBT community">
Racism in the LGBT community

Racism is a noted concern in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities. This can be against members of any race, ethnicity or nationality and may include discrimination and bigotry.
In the United States, ethnic minority LGBT individuals may find themselves in a double minority, where they are neither fully accepted or understood by mainly white LGBT communities, nor are they accepted by their own ethnic group. Many people experience racism in the dominant LGBT community where racial stereotypes merge with gender stereotypes, such that Asian-American LGBTs are viewed as more passive and feminine, while African-American LGBTs are viewed as more masculine and aggressive. There are a number of culturally specific support networks for LGBT individuals active in the United States. For example, "Ô-Môi" for Vietnamese American queer females.
Antisemitism.
The short-lived National Socialist League of the United States limited its membership to white gay males. The now-defunct Order of the Jarls of Baelder encouraged white gay males to join for the promotion of the Nazi ideal of male bonding. The documentary "Men Heroes and Gay Nazis" addressed the phenomenon of gay neo-Nazis in Germany. Michael Kühnen and Nicky Crane were notorious gay neo-Nazis.
According to the "Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures", lesbian feminist organizations don't discuss antisemitism when discussing the fighting of oppression because they believe it doesn't exist anymore or is not as important as racism or homophobia. Some lesbian feminists have accused Jews of being "killers of the Goddess" because they believe that the God of Israel is male or androgynous. Jews are also often blamed for the patriarchy. Many sexual roleplays done by gays and lesbians play out Nazi/Jew fetishes in a sado-masochistic fashion and Jewish lesbians are often invisible in the Lesbian community. Some lesbians wear swastikas both during and outside their sex life trying to transform the symbol or ignore the impact it has on the Jewish community.
Similar to the "No blacks or Asians" comments made on dating sites "No Jews!" isn't unheard of either. 
Nikola Alexeyev, a prominent LGBT rights activist in Russia, has made extremely anti-Semitic statements on his Facebook and Twitter account. He has called Out Magazine a "Jewish slut magazine" and called Micheal Lucas, a Jewish LGBT activist and adult performer a "Jewish pig, Israeli monkey" as well as using kike and yid repeatedly in several of his posts. He even claims Jewish vodka is made from sperm. He even accused Micheal Lucas of attempting to kill his mother and was threatening to hire someone to kill him. He also stated "the Jewish mafia is trying to overtake the world and now LGBT fight in Russia" and "America is ruled by Jewish mafia" When confronted with the accusation he used the "I have many Jewish friends" argument. 
Anti-Arab racism.
A report titled We're Family Too studied what it calls same-sex attracted men and women from Arab backgroups in Australia. The respondents were from both Christian and Muslim religious backgrounds. Many in the Arab community spoke about ethnic stereotypes.
Some Mizrahi Jews and Arab Jews report exclusion and discrimination by the Ashkenazi LGBT community in Israel. Some LGBT Mizrahi Jews have alleged that aspects of Ashkenazi LGBT activism express "Ashkenazi hegemony" and leave "no legitimized cultural space for Mizrahi queers to express their Arab culture and heritage."
Anti-black racism.
Many LGBT Black people report experiencing racism from the white LGBT community, leading some to repudiate labels such as "gay" and repudiate connection to white LGBT culture. The term same gender loving was coined by the activist Cleo Manago to describe people of African descent who are attracted to the same sex, as opposed to terms such as "gay/lesbian", "bisexual", or "queer". This term was meant to actively express pride in one's racial heritage.
Some black gay men report discrimination and harassment from white gay men in gay bars and clubs. In the past, there were gay bars that would put up anti-Black signs that said things such as, "No Blacks, Fems, or Faggots."
Some gay black South African men have reported experiencing "grotesque racism" from white gay men during the time of Apartheid.
Chuck Knipp, a white gay male drag performer who is known for his blackface act "Shirley Q. Liquor", has been accused of racism. Responding to Knipp's declaration that the Liquor character "was created in celebration of, not to downgrade, black women," Jasmyne Cannick countered in her blog: "...it is not possible for Charles Knipp, a white man, to help heal years of mistreatment and racism at the hands of his people by putting on a wig, speaking Ebonics, and in blackface...There is nothing remotely uplifting about Knipp’s act and I wish people would stop defending his character with the tired argument that he’s trying to heal the nation. The only thing Knipp is trying to heal is the hole in his pocket by filling it with all of the money he makes off of degrading Black people."
Sexual stereotyping.
Some authors have written that much of the racism against LGBT black people is rooted in sexual racism and the linking of sex role stereotypes and racial stereotypes. Black men who express a sexual preference for white men have been alleged to be suffering from "an insidious legacy of white racism" that causes internalized racism in black men. Some Afrocentric gay men are opposed to interracial relationships, believing that gay black men who prefer white men lack strong roots in the Black community or are oblivious to racism. The anti-interracial Afrocentrists believe that instead of "hating their blackness", gay black men should only date other gay black men. A slogan that promotes black-on-black gay relationships is "Black men loving black men", which was popularized by Joseph F. Beam's anthology "In the Life" and the Marlon Riggs video "Tongues Untied".
Anti-Hispanic and anti-Latino racism.
Gay Hispanic and Latino men report experiencing racism both within and outside the gay community. Latino gay men with darker skin color and indigenous features reported the greatest level of discrimination, including from the white gay community. Latina lesbians also report experiencing racism from the white LGBT community. Latin@ gays and lesbians have been engaged in autonomous organizing since the 1970s addressing issues of racism, sexism, and homophobia. The first Latina lesbian organization was founded in Los Angeles in the early 1980s and the National Latino/a Lesbian & Gay Organization (LLEGÓ) was founded in 1987, with Latino/a LGBT people choosing to organize separately due to both racism in the LGBT community and homophobia in the straight Latino community.
In 2006, Latino Americans staged a protest in The Castro, San Francisco, against anti-Latino racism in the LGBT community.
The organization "La Casa" in East Los Angeles, California, exists to serve the LGBT Latino community and create a safe-space free from homophobia and racism. Members have expressed their experiences with "blatant racism" from the white LGBT community, particularly in West Hollywood.
Anti-Turkish racism.
LGBT people of Turkish descent in Germany often report experiencing "triple discrimination": racism and Islamophobia from the non-Turkish German community and homophobia from the straight Turkish and German communities. However, while Turkish-Germans “still face racism in the (gay) scene”, the level of racism has declined in the past 20 years. Murat Bahs¸i, a former board member of the organization GLADT (Gays and Lesbians of Turkish Backgrounds), has stated that racism and racial stereotypes from ethnic German men often contributed to the disintegration of inter-ethnic relationships between Turkish and German men.
Anti-indigenous racism.
Aboriginal Canadians.
Lesbian aboriginal women report feeling marginalized from both mainstream and LGBT cultures, as well as from aboriginal communities and other communities of color.
Gay aboriginal men, many of whom also identify as two-spirited, often face both homophobia within aboriginal communities and racism within the LGBT community.
Indigenous Australians.
Gay Aboriginal men in Australia have reported lack of inclusion and representation in the white-dominated LGBT community. When aboriginal men have been included in LGBT organizing efforts, it has often been in a tokenizing way.
Māori people in New Zealand.
Takatāpui identity is a way for many LGBT Māori people to express their dual identity as both Māori and non-heterosexual. While the term fell into disuse for many years, it has recently been reclaimed as an expression of pride. Some Māori people have questioned the focus on same-sex marriage in the Pākehā LGBT community. In traditional Māori culture it was not uncommon for either straight or gay couples to be unmarried. The LGBT Māori people who critique the overemphasis on same-sex marriage believe that focusing too narrowly on marital rights is harmful and reduces diversity in the LGBT community. They believe that the focus on marriage is a product of "whiteness".
Native Americans.
Native American lesbians frequently report racism from white lesbians. Some Native American lesbians report feeling disenchanted with white people, including white lesbians, and have established separatist communities exclusively for Native American women or for women of color. Native American lesbians have established communes in the American Midwest and Northern California, in an attempt to repudiate white culture, live self-sufficiently, and return to the traditions of their tribal ancestors.
Anti-Asian racism.
In a study done by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force on LGBT Asian Americans and Pacific Islands Americans, 82% of the surveyed participants reporting experiencing racism from white members of the LGBT community.
British Asian gay men living in Yorkshire and elsewhere in Northern England have reported increasing levels of racism and racial abuse from white gay men. More multicultural areas, with higher immigration, such as Manchester and London, were found to be much more tolerant by the Naz Project.
Sexual racism.
Asian men are often represented in media, both mainstream and LGBT, as being feminized and desexualized. LGBT Asian men often report "sexual racism" from white LGBT men. The gay Asian-Canadian author Richard Fung has written that while black men are portrayed as hypersexualized, gay Asian men are portrayed as being the undersexed opposite. Fung has also written about feminizing depictions of Asian men in gay pornography, which often focuses on gay Asian men's submission to the pleasure of white men, and how gay Asian men tend to ignore or display displeasure with races such as Arabs, blacks, and even other Asians, but seemingly give sexual acceptance and approval to gay white men. Ironically, white gay men more than other racial groups are the ones that frequently state "No Asians" when seeking partners. When itcomes to interracial gay male pornography, Asian men are usually portrayed as submissive "bottoms."
Gay Asian men frequently experience racism on gay dating websites, where it is common for profiles to state a sexual preference for men of certain races, such as by writing, "No Asians!" or "No fats, no femmes, no Asians." Some Asian gay men report being "relegated to the bottom of the attractiveness spectrum" due to "racial lookism", a combination of racism and lookism.
Anti-Italian racism.
Some LGBT Italian Americans report experiencing anti-Italian discrimination from within the LGBT community. Italian American gay men, particularly darker-skinned men such as Italian Americans of Sicilian descent, report experiencing sexual objectification from lighter-skinned white men. Similar to the way Black, Asian, and Latino men are sometimes portrayed, Italian men are likewise portrayed at times as "the object of desire of the white man" as well as being "exotic and well-endowed, oversexed and extremely passionate." These sexual stereotypes of Italian and Sicilian gay men also appear frequently in gay pornography, but are not exclusive to the gay community.
Antiziganism.
Anti-Romani racism has been reported within the non-Romani LGBT community in Romania. When the musician, Madonna, condemned homophobia and antiziganism during her 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour, many LGBT Romanians responded on websites and blogs by lambasting Madonna for linking the plight of LGBT people with the plight of the Romani people. Numerous LGBT commenters and bloggers referred to LGBT people as "decent civilised people", while deriding Romani people as thieves and criminals who are incompatible with "civilised society."

Walter Lewis Bridgland

Walter Lewis "Wally" Bridgland A.M., O.B.E., J.P. (23 March 1908 – 30 July 1987) was a prominent South Australian businessman and a Lord Mayor of Adelaide.
History.
Wally was born at the tin mining town of Greenbushes, Western Australia, where his newly-wed parents Harrie Walter and Hannah Maud Bridgland had set up a store. A year later they returned to Adelaide, living for much of his early life at the Barnard Street, North Adelaide home of the hospitable grandparents Lewis and Selina Cohen; his mother helped run the household. Around 1925 the Cohens moved into an apartment in Colley Terrace, Glenelg and Wally's parents moved to 59 Partridge Street, Glenelg
He was a student at Pulteney Street School (later to become Pulteney Grammar School, then at Queen’s College in North Adelaide. He excelled at schoolboy athletics, cricket and football but like his father, his passion was for swimming, eventually becoming President and a Life Member of the SA Amateur Swimming Association. In 1932 he was instrumental in saving a man who was drowning in the sea off Glenelg and was awarded a medal by the Royal Humane Society. His home for most of his adult life was in Pier Street Glenelg, just a few minutes' walk from the beach.
Wally joined the Cadets while at high school, then after leaving school in 1924, while working as accountant for his father's finance company, enrolled with the CMF, and served in the AIF during World War II, initially with the Light Horse Regiment, which became the Armoured Corps. Because of his experience in the CMF he received a commission and later became a captain. He was transferred to the RAEME in a Docks Operating Company in charge of the harbour at Madang. Later he was stationed at a hotel in Willunga in charge of Italian POWs who were working farms south of Adelaide. After the war he rejoined the CMF, retiring in 1957.
In 1946, after demobbing, he set up a business at 91a Gawler Place "W. L. Bridgland children's furnishings" selling nursery furniture. The shop grew to specialise in play equipment, toys and hobbies. His son Michael joined the business in 1951 and was made a partner in 1957 and a second shop in 81 Gawler Place specialising in models, particularly model trains was opened and as “Bridgland’s Hobbies” became their sole outlet some time around 1970. The business closed in 1986.
Public Life.
While Lord Mayor, he was the Council’s representative on the Municipal Association of S.A., the Metropolitan County Board, the Council of the Royal Zoological Society, the National Parks Commission, St. Johns Ambulance Association and the Royal Humane Society.
Family.
Walter was the only son of Harrie Walter Bridgland (31 May 1879 – 17 October 1947) whose father Walter James Bridgland died on 20 September 1878 and whose mother Mary Ann Bridgland (née Wigzell) (ca.June 1856 – 7 January 1885) subsequently married Vaiben Solomon on 6 December 1880 in Darwin, Northern Territory. Harrie grew up with the surname Solomon, but the relationship with his adoptive father broke down irrevocably some time before 1903 and he resumed his birth name. Thirty years later he acknowledged the father he never knew and not his stepfather.
Walter's mother, Hannah Maud Bridgland (), was a daughter of Sir Lewis Cohen, several times mayor of Adelaide.
Walter married Elizabeth Grace "Betty" Saunders (23 June 1906 – 1994), daughter of Rachel "Ray" and Solomon "Sol" Saunders, on 9 April 1929 after he had undergone Jewish studies and learned Hebrew (though Jewish by birth, he had a secular upbringing). They had two children:

Sunset in Wyoming

Sunset in Wyoming is a 1941 American Western film directed by William Morgan and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, George Cleveland, and Maris Wrixon. Based on a story by Joe Blair, the film is about a singing cowboy who goes up against a lumber company clearcutting the timber from a local mountain causing catastrophic flooding and endangering the lives of valley ranchers. The film features the songs "There's a Home in Wyomin'" and "Sing Me a Song of the Saddle".
Plot.
The Wentworth Lumber Company has been clearcutting trees on Mount Warner without considering the consequences. After one heavy rain, the ranchers in the valley suffer flood damage to their lands, the result of recent logging activities. The ranchers approach company manager Phipps (John Dilson) and camp foreman Bull Wilson (Stanley Blystone), urging them to plant new trees to prevent the dangerous runoff. Phipps and Wilson ignore the requests, and when confrontations with the ranchers turn violent, singing cowboy and rancher Gene Autry offers to appeal directly to the lumber company's president, Asa Wentworth (George Cleveland).
Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) meet with Asa, who tells them he recently turned control of the company over to his granddaughter Wilmetta "Billie" Wentworth (Maris Wrixon) and general manager Larry Drew (Robert Kent), and he is not happy with the way they've been running the business. Asa is also concerned about Billie's romantic interest in Larry, whom he does not trust. He asks Gene to meet with her at her country club and talk some sense into her.
At the country club, Frog has a difficult time adapting to the fancy surroundings. After Gene accidentally pushes Billie into a swimming pool, they are thrown out of the club. They return to Asa's house where the old man decides to throw a party and introduce Gene to Billie's influential friends. Later he sends out the invitations under Billie's name. At the party, Asa tells Gene to impress animal lover Susannah Hawkins Peabody (Sarah Edwards), whose husband Cornelius (Dick Elliott) is the state lieutenant governor. Hoping to preserve Mount Warner by having it declared a state park, Gene tells Susannah that the mountain is a haven for wild animals. As Gene and Susannah make arrangements for her to inspect the area, two of Billie's other friends grow suspicious of her absence and telephone her at a nightclub. Thinking that Gene and Frog have arranged the party on their own, and unaware of her grandfather's involvement, Billie has them arrested.
The next day, Asa arrives at the jail, bails them out, and returns with them to the valley to organize a campaign to create a state park at Mount Warner. Despite the violent opposition of Bull and his men, Gene is able to convince a state committee to inspect the area, which has now been stocked with wild animals by Frog. When Frog leads out a lion and a panther, however, Susannah realizes that she has been tricked, and she, Cornelius, Billie, and Larry prepare to leave in anger. As a huge rainstorm approaches, Gene warns them that the roads will be washed out, but they ignore him. While the desperate citizens of the valley are being flooded out of their homes, Gene and Frog chase after Asa's car, which they find stuck on a bridge. After getting everyone out of the car, Asa is swept into the river and saved by Gene.
Back at Gene's house, Billie sees all of the displaced ranchers and realizes that Gene has been telling the truth about their hardship. She also realizes that Larry was only interested in exploiting the area. In an effort to correct her past mistakes, Billie fires Larry, asks Asa to take back control of the company, and supports the state park legislation. Sometime later, on the day the park is dedicated, Asa and Frog watch with satisfaction as Gene and Billie walk off together to a new life.

Wet-tail

Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24–48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age.
Causes.
Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, "Lawsonia intracellularis". Wet-tail is a stress related illness - such stress can be caused by a variety of factors, including:
Symptoms.
The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are: 
Treatment.
Recovery is most likely if it is spotted within the first 24–48 hours, and you should seek veterinary advice - a vet may choose to give the animal drugs.
The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease - wet tail can be very contagious so sanitize all objects the animal has come in contact with (wheel, food dish, huts, etc.).
If your animal doesn't want to eat, then dry, unflavored oats can be hand fed, which can also help with the diahrrea. The animal should only be fed dry foods, any foods with a high water content should be avoided.
If the animal has an unclean or matted rear-end, this should not be remedied using a bath in water - instead a q-tip (cotton bud) or cotton ball can be used to very gently clean the animal's rear end to avoid discomfort or rashes.
If the animal is not drinking, hydration can be aided by scruffing (i.e. very gently holding the rodent by the extra skin on the back of the neck) the animal so that they open their mouth; then in small, short intervals, water can be provided with a 1ml syringe. It is very important that this is done slowly, to avoid getting water down the animal's wind pipe. Unflavored pedialyte can be purchased from a grocery store and can be very helpful with wet tail. If feeding is also an issue, a suggested aide is to feed extremely small amounts of no garlic, no onion, no added sugar mashed baby food, and administered using the same scruffing method, and again at a very slow pace.

Charles McArthur

Charles McArthur (May 1844 – 3 July 1910) was a British average adjuster from Liverpool. He was also a Liberal Unionist politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1897 and 1910.
McArthur was born near Bristol in Kingsdown, the son of Charles McArthur from Port Glasgow in Scotland. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School, and moved to Liverpool in 1860 (aged 16) to work for North, Ewing & Co. However that business was unsuccessful,
and in 1874 McArthur established his own average adjuster's business, Cort & McArthur.
This business prospered, and McArthur became one of the best-known average adjusters in England.
He served as chairman of the Association of Average Adjusters in the United Kingdom, as well as President of Liverpool Chamber of Commerce from 1892 to 1896, and as a Justice of the Peace in Liverpool.
He served on several committees relating to marine insurance, including the Comité Maritime International, and wrote several books on marine insurance. He also wrote on religious topics. 
In 1897 he was chosen as the Liberal Unionist candidate for the by-election in the Liverpool Exchange seat. He was elected with a majority of only 54 votes (1%of the total) over his Liberal Party opponent Russell Rea,
and at the 1900 general election he was returned with an increased majority of 1,297 (30% of the votes) over the Liberal Frederick William Verney.
However, at the next election, in 1906, McArthur was defeated by the Liberal Richard Cherry, who had recently been appointed as Attorney General for Ireland.
Apart from the nationwide swing to the Liberals, who gained 216 seats in that election,
McArthur's defeat involved several local factors. As a free trader, he lost the support of the many local unionists who favoured the system of protectionism known at the time as tariff reform; while his staunch opposition to Irish Home Rule galvanised the large Irish Nationalist population to support Cherry. 
However, McArthur returned to Parliament the following year, when he was elected at a by-election in September 1907 as the MP for Liverpool Kirkdale. He told constituents that his election was a defeat of the Labour Party candidate John Hill was a great victory for "the Protestants of Kirkdale" over socilaists and Irish nationalists.
He was re-elected in January 1910, and held the seat until his death. 
McArthur died aged 66 on 3 July 1910 at his home in London, from a gastric illness. His body was taken by train to Liverpool, and his funeral was held at Wallasey cemetery
in Liscard, Cheshire.

Beer Stein Marker

Beer Stein Markers were puppets of knitted wool used by Bavarian beer drinkers to clearly identify their tankards when sent back for refilling. The puppets were usually about 10cm high and fixed to the thumbpiece on the lid. Traditionally they were caricatures of politicians of the time, both popular and unpopular. The custom was particularly to be seen at the Löwenbräukeller in Munich during the 1890s. 
In his 1897 article on beer-markers George Dollar wrote that "the "beer-marker" custom has been known to Munich for many years, and that it has been adopted in nearly all of the German cities and towns. In the Löwenbräu Keller the markers are sold for fifty pfennige, or sixpence, each, by an old woman who goes round amongst the beer-drinkers with a basket. She is a well-known character in Munich, and knits the figures herself."
A more modern solution is to affix a brightly coloured plastic token to beer bottles at social gatherings and thereby to prevent confusion.

RCW 79

RCW 79 is an emission nebula in the constellation Centaurus.
A cosmic bubble of gas and dust, RCW 79 has grown to about 70 light-years in diameter, blown by the winds and radiation from hot young stars. Infrared light from the dust embedded in the nebula is tinted red in this gorgeous false-color view from the Spitzer Space Telescope. A good 17 thousand light-years away in the grand southern constellation Centaurus, the expanding nebula itself has triggered star formation as it plows into the gas and dust surrounding it. In fact, this penetrating infrared picture reveals groups of new stars as yellowish points scattered along the bubble's edge. One remarkable group still lies within its own natal bubble at about 7 o'clock (lower left), while another can be seen near the upper gap at about 3 o'clock (right) from the bubble's center.
This 1.7 million year old nebula forms a ring around a central ionising star. A 2002 paper gives a distance of 5300 +/- 400 parsecs and identifies the ionising star, which is visible in both hydrogen-alpha and infrared, as either a late O-class star or Wolf-Rayet star but does not cite a catalog identifier.
NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope easily detects infrared light from the dust particles in RCW 79. The young stars within RCW79 radiate ultraviolet light that excites molecules of dust within the bubble. This causes the dust grains to emit infrared light that is detected by Spitzer and seen here as the extended red features.

European Heritage Alliance 3.3

The European Heritage Alliance 3.3, an informal European sectoral platform composed of 30 European or international networks and organisations active in the wider field of cultural heritage, was launched in June 2011 on the occasion of the European Heritage Congress 2011 organised by Europa Nostra in Amsterdam.
On this occasion, Europe’s major heritage networks agreed to work more closely together to promote the untapped potential of Europe’s heritage, cultural and natural, immovable and movable. The Alliance founding members bring together Europe’s civil society organisations, historic cities and villages, museums, heritage professionals and volunteers, (private) owners of collections of artefacts, historic buildings and cultural landscapes, educators, town planners, etc. The “European Heritage Alliance 3.3” thus represents a very large constituency composed of tens of millions of Europe’s citizens. Europa Nostra is acting as facilitator of the alliance.
The name of this Alliance refers to the article 3.3. of the consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty of the European Union which stipulates that "“Union shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe’s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.”"

Philippine resistance against Japan

During the Japanese occupation in World War II, there was an extensive Philippine resistance movement, which opposed the Japanese with active underground and guerrilla activity that increased over the years. Fighting the guerrillas were a Japanese-formed Bureau of Constabulary (later taking the name of the old Philippine Constabulary during the "Second Republic"), Kempeitai, and the Makapili. Postwar studies revealed that around 260,000 persons were organized under guerrilla groups and that members of anti-Japanese underground organizations were more numerous. Such was their effectiveness that by the end of World War II, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces.
Also by the end of the war, some 277 separate guerrilla units made up of some 260,715 individuals fought in the resistance movement. Select units of the resistance would go on to be reorganized and equipped as units of the Philippine Army and Constabulary.
Background.
The Attack on Pearl Harbor (called "Hawaii Operation" or "Operation AI" by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ("Operation Z" in planning) and the "Battle of Pearl Harbor") was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan and the Philippines). The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.
Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese pushed on the operations to invade the Philippines. 43 planes bombed Tuguegarao and Baguio in the first preemptive strike in Luzon. The Japanese forces then quickly conducted a landing at Batan Island, and by December 17, General Masaharu Homma gave his estimate that the main component of the United States Air Force in the archipelago was destroyed. By January 2, Manila was under Japanese control and by January 9, Homma had cornered the remaining forces in Bataan. By April 9, the remaining of the combined Filipino-American force was forced to retire from Bataan to Corregidor. Meanwhile, Japanese invasions of Cebu (April 19) and Panay (April 20) met enormous successes. By May 7, after the last of the Japanese attacks on Corregidor, General Jonathan M. Wainwright announced through a radio broadcast in Manila the surrender of the Philippines. Following Wainwright was General William F. Sharp, who surrendered Visayas and Mindanao on May 10.
Then came the Bataan Death March (Japanese:) (1942) was the forcible transfer, by the Imperial Japanese Army, of 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war after the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The death toll of the march is difficult to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), and it is not known how many died in the fighting that was taking place concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.
Hukbalahap resistance.
As originally constituted in March 1942, the Hukbalahap was to be part of a broad united front resistance to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. This original intent is reflected in its name: ""Hukbong Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon"", which was "People's Army Against the Japanese" when translated into English. The adopted slogan was "Anti-Japanese Above All".
The Huk Military Committee was at the apex of Huk structure and was charged to direct the guerrilla campaign and to lead the revolution that would seize power after the war. Luis Taruc; a communist leader and peasant-organizer from a barrio in Pampanga; was elected as head the committee, and became the first Huk commander called ""El Supremo"".
The Huks began their anti-Japanese campaign as five 100-man units. They obtained needed arms and ammunition from Philippine army stragglers, which were escapees from the Battle of Bataan and deserters from the Philippine Constabulary, in exchange of civilian clothes. The Huk recruitment campaign progressed more slowly than Taruc had expected, due to U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE) guerrilla units, of which Ramon Magsaysay was included. The U.S. units already had recognition among the islands, had trained military leaders, and an organized command and logistical system. Despite being restrained by the American sponsored guerrilla units, the Huks nevertheless took to the battlefield only 500 men and much fewer weapons. Several setbacks at the hands of the Japanese and with less than enthusiastic support from USAFFE units did not hinder the Huks growth in size and efficiency throughout the war, developing into a well trained, highly organized force with some 15,000 armed fighters by war's end.
Moro resistance on Mindanao and Sulu.
The Moro Muslims of Mindanao and Sulu took up arms and fought hard against the Japanese invasion and helped defeat the Japanese occupation. Some of the Moros had been fighting the Americans just weeks before the Japanese invaded and proceeded to direct their fight against the new invaders as well. Sultan Jainal Abirin II of Sulu opposed the Japanese invasion.
The Moro juramentados performed suicide attacks against Japanese troops, as they had against the Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, but did not ever attack the Chinese since the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people. The Japanese responded to these suicide attacks by massacring all the relatives of the attacker.
An American POW Herbert Zincke recalled in his secret diary that the Japanese guarding him and other prisoners were scared of the Moro warriors and tried to keep as far away from them as possible to avoid getting attacked. The American First Lieutenant Mel Amler recalled that some of the Moros would sometimes attack and stab Japanese, Filipino, and Americans, fighting all of them at once. Neither the Moros nor the Japanese respected the Geneva Convention in regards to not attacking medics, the Moros out of ignorance and the Japanese because they did not sign the treaty. American General Robert L. Eichelberger saw a Japanese soldier who was captured by the Moros and feared being tortured at their hands, and he wanted Eichelberger to kill him to stop it from happening. The American POW Victor L. Mapes saw Japanese troops getting ambushed and slaughtered by Moro fighters with kris blades. The Moros were skilled at melee combat, with some Moros deliberately impaling their own shoulder on Japanese bayonets and grabbing it to make it stay in place while killing the Japanese soldier using a bayonet or bolo with their other hand.
Anti-Japanese Moro units like the Maranao Militia were led by Salipada Pendatun, another anti-Japanese Moro unit, the Moro-Bolo Battalion was led by Datu Gumbay Piang, consisting of about 20,000 men. Gumbay Piang's Cotabato Moros used Bolo knives to fight the Japanese, and swore that they would "fight to the last". An oath was sworn by Alonto, the Sultan of Ramain, and 10,000 other Moros in Lanao that they would fight to drive the Japanese out, and sent in a message that said "We have prepared our bladed weapons because we lack firearms, and with sharp kris, barong, campilan, tabas and spear we will attack or defend as ordered," "and no mercy asked." Alonto said "all fighting men of Lanao would like to sign their names, but they are too many". They promised to fight to the death against the Japanese and "swore upon the Koran". The Japanese demanded that all the natives in the Philippines hand over any implement which was a weapon or could be utilized as a weapon, including Bolo knives, and the Japanese may have issued this order because of the Moro pledge to fight the Japanese since the Moros were skilled with bladed weapons. The American Captain Edward Kraus recommended Moro fighters for a suggested plan to capture an airbase in Lake Lanao for eventually driving the Japanese occupiers out of the Philippines.
Davao in Mindanao had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II. These Japanese were hated by the Moros and disliked by the Chinese. The Moros were judged as "fully capable of dealing with Japanese fifth columnists and invaders alike." The Moros were to fight the Japanese invaders when they landed at Davao on Mindanao. The Japanese went back to their ships at night to sleep since the Moros struck so much fear into them, even though the Moros were outnumbered by the Japanese.
It was reported that most of Mindanao was dominated by Moro, Filipino, and American guerilla forces during the Japanese occupation. The Moros had cleared the Japanese out from the Muslim areas of Mindanao six months before America returned to liberate the Philippines at the Battle of Leyte. The Moros then joined in on the battle to liberate the rest of Mindanao from the Japanese in 1945.
According to Nur Misuari's Moro National Liberation Front faction's website, the Japanese "exhibited tyranny, cruelty and inhumanity at its lowest level", and "had to suffer their worst defeat and highest death mortality at the hands of the Bangsamoro freedom fighters".
A Muslim cleric from the Sulu in the Philippines, Imam Marajukim, helped supply Chinese and Suluk Muslim guerillas under Albert Kwok on British Borneo who were fighting the Japanese. Suluks were described as "strongly disposed to be anti-Japanese". Imam Marajukim helped the Chinese secure the indigenous participation in the uprising by Panglima Ali's Suluks, Mantanni and Danawan (Dinawan) islands Binadan inhabitants and Oudar Islanders under Orang Tuah Arshad.
The Imperial Japanese Navy medic Akira Makino revealed that while he was stationed on Mindanao at Zamboanga from December 1944 to February 1945, he and other Japanese troops in his unit killed Moro Muslim prisoners by beheading or performed vivisections on them, cutting them open while they were alive to study their internal organs like their stomachs, and the Japanese also forced the Moros to dig their own graves.
Some of the weapons used by the Moros against the Japanese were again used by them in the Moro insurgency in the Philippines.
USAFFE and American sponsored guerrillas.
After Bataan and Corregidor, many who escaped the Japanese reorganized in the mountains as guerrillas still loyal to the U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE). One example would be the unit of Ramon Magsaysay in Zambales, which first served as a supply and intelligence unit. After the surrender in May 1942, Magsaysay and his unit formed a guerrilla force which grew to a 10,000-man force by the end of the war. Another was the Hunters ROTC which operated in the Southern Luzon area, mainly near Manila. It was created upon dissolution of the Philippine Military Academy in the beginning days of the war. Cadet Terry Adivoso, refused to simply go home as cadets were ordered to do, and began recruiting fighters willing to undertake guerrilla action against the Japanese. This force would later be instrumental, providing intelligence to the liberating forces led by General Douglas MacArthur, and took an active role in numerous battles, such as the Raid at Los Baños. When war broke out in the Philippines, some 300 Philippine Military Academy and ROTC cadets, unable to join the USAFFE units because of their youth, banded together in a common desire to contribute to the war effort throughout the Bataan campaign. The Hunters originally conducted operations with another guerrilla group called Marking's Guerrillas, with whom they went about liquidating Japanese spies. Led by Miguel Ver, a PMA cadet, the Hunters raided the enemy-occupied Union College in Manila and seized 130 Enfield rifles.
Also, before being proven false in 1985, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos claimed that he had commanded a 9,000-strong force of guerrillas known as the Maharlika Unit. Marcos also used "maharlika" as his personal "nom de guerre", depicting himself as the most bemedalled anti-Japanese Filipino guerrilla fighter during World War II.
Guerrilla armies.
A variety of guerrilla organizations sprang up in the Philippine Islands during the Japanese occupation. The following list begins with the LGF, the first major guerrilla organization in the Philippine Islands, then lists the major units on Luzon, Panay, and Mindanao, arranged in order of their locations, approximately north to south. Other units also existed on Luzon and almost every inhabited Philippine island.
Militarily the Huks fielded combat "Squadrons" of 100 men each, divided into platoons and squads. Two squadrons = a battalion, and two battalions = a regiment. Each squadron had a commander, a vice-commander, a political instructor, a supply officer, and an intelligence officer, although there were no ranks.
The Japanese captured Colonel Thorp in October, 1942 and his deputy, Captain Joseph R. Barker took command of LGF. In January 1943, Barker went into Manila disguised as a Catholic priest and was also captured, after which the LGF began to fall apart. There was never a unified guerrilla command in the Philippines after Barker's capture. Even though Colonel Thorp and all of his appointed commanders were captured and executed by the Japanese, several of the guerrilla organizations he established continued to grow and became quite effective in intelligence gathering and in harassing the Japanese. The story of Colonel Claude A. Thorp and his men is included in "Bataan Diary".

Reception.
Telugucinema.com gave a review of rating 3/5 stating "Sushanth makes decent debut. He can become good actor by honing skills further. A very formulaic story but decent film for a debutant." Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating "Despite less glamour, the debutant hero, Sushant, is able to gain mass hero image. There are several elements in the film like sentiment, glamour, action and love scenes in the film to cater to the needs of all classes of audiences. The film does not appear like a debutant's film and the production values of Sri Nag Corporation are adequate." IndiaGlitz gave a review stating "Sushant showed excellent ease in dances and action scenes, despite it is his debut film. Tamanna too looked gorgeous in the film in ultra modern outfits. She was very romantic all through the film. Though there is not much scope to prove her acting talents, her role was moulded in a near sexy way. The director was able to maintain good tempo all through the film. He did never lose grip on the story. He moulded the hero's character with a sole aim of giving him a mass image." Cinegoer.com gave a review stating "The movie has nothing new or good to offer, but it isn't an unbearable affair either. Sushanth's debut is not bad, but a makeover and voice modulation, some more of the grooming and training (dance-fights-etc) he's obviously received will go a long way. For now, he has miles to travel before he gets a claim to fame. The movie has taken a middling formulaic route." Sify.com gave a review stating the film to be a watchable one.
Music.
Music of the film was released on March 31, 2008 at a function organized in Annapurna studios. The function was held without inviting press as it was an exclusive event to Nagarjuna’s MAA TV. The producer has later given the event gallery to the press. The music of the film was composed by Chakri and songs were penned by Chandrabose

Reception.
Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network gave "Vividred Operation" a B+ based on the first six episodes, saying, "The series' execution makes it easy to enjoy the story's strengths and hard to hold its many, many weaknesses against it." Dan Barnett of UK Anime Network gave the first three episodes an 8 out of 10, calling it "not to be missed", although he noted that ""Vividred" can't seem to decide what kind of an audience it's going for and has instead diluted the experience by trying to go for all of them at once. The show sits in a bit of an odd place where it'll be too tame for the majority of the audience who loved "Strike Witches", yet at the same time it's still too racy and male-friendly to appeal to the young girls who are traditionally the audience for magical girl shows."

Lawrason Riggs

Lawrason Riggs (October 17, 1861 – November 22, 1940) was a Baltimore businessman, civic leader, and collector of prints.
Biography.
Lawrason Riggs was born on October 17, 1861, in New York to Lawrason Riggs and his third wife Mary "Bright" Turpin Riggs as the eldest of ten children. When Riggs was six years old, the family relocated to Maryland, where they had ties dating back to the seventeenth century. In 1883, Lawrason Riggs received his bachelor of arts degree from Princeton University and in 1886 obtained a law degree from the University of Maryland. Riggs also completed post-graduate work in history and political science at Johns Hopkins University. Although Lawrason Riggs was trained as an attorney, he never practiced law. He served as the director of the First National Bank, Mercantile Trust Company, National Mechanic's Bank, and American Bonding Company. Riggs died on November 22, 1940, and was buried in Green Mount Cemetery.
Civic leadership.
Lawrason Riggs participated in civic affairs in a number of capacities. He joined the Fifth Regiment of the Maryland National Guard in which he was rapidly promoted to the position of Brigadier General due to his leadership in the Great Baltimore Fire in 1904. Riggs was a dedicated member of the Maryland Historical Society, served as president of the Board of Trustees of the Maryland Training School for Boys, was part of the School Board and Family Welfare Association, presided over a three-man Police Board, and chaired The Municipal Affairs Committee of the Baltimore Association of Commerce. Riggs, who had a close family connection to George Peabody, was a member of the inaugual Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute on which he served for forty-three years. He was a founding member of the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA), for which he advocated for a municipal museum in the City-Wide Congress Committee (1911–1914), acted as one of the eight incorporators in 1914, and served on the first Board of Trustees. Riggs was instrumental in finding a permanent location for the BMA and bought the Carroll-Thomas mansion at 101 West Monument Street in 1925 that served as the museum until the present building designed by John Russell Pope was completed in 1929. Throughout the 1930s, Riggs contributed funds to pay the salary of the museum director and helped sponsor exhibitions. He often promoted the museum by lending pieces from his own collection to exhibits.
Art collection.
Lawrason Riggs was an avid collector of Chinese porcelain and prints. His print collection, which included prints from the late fifteenth through twentieth centuries, was given to the Baltimore Museum of Art as a permanent loan by two of Riggs's brothers in 1941 and was formally accession by the institution in 1943. The two most-represented artists in the collection are Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt, but many printmakers from America, England, Holland, France, China, Japan, and Italy are also represented. Riggs's criteria for his collection included the notoriety of the artist, quality of the print, and beauty. Lawrason Riggs tended to purchase his prints through the dealers, among them being: Fitz Ray Carrington, Arthur H. Harlow & Co., Frderic K. Kepel & Co., Anderson Galleries, R. Ederheimer, Scott & Fowles Co., and Rudolf Seckel. Riggs has a particularly close relationship with art dealer F. Meader, who not only helped Riggs locate works but also assisted in restoring and framing prints.

Charles Esmond de Wolff

Brigadier Charles Esmond de Wolff CB CBE (25 November 1893 – 12 October 1986) was a British Army officer.
De Wolff was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment (Territorial Force) in 1914 and served throughout the First World War. He transferred to the Army Ordnance Department (later the Royal Army Ordnance Corps) as a temporary lieutenant in August 1915 and was promoted acting captain in October 1916. He served with the British Salonika Force in 1918, for which he was mentioned in despatches in November 1918 and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in January 1919, by which time he was a temporary captain and acting major.
In 1919 he was appointed Assistant Director of Ordnance Services (ADOS) in South Russia during the Russian Civil War and was promoted acting lieutenant-colonel in February 1919. For his service in this campaign he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in November 1919. He also received the Russian Order of St Vladimir.
He was promoted substantive captain, acting major and acting ordnance officer 3rd class in April 1920, but reverted to the rank of captain and the grade of ordnance officer 4th class in February 1921. He was promoted substantive major and ordnance officer 3rd class in April 1929, substantive lieutenant-colonel and ordnance officer 2nd class in March 1936.
In March 1939 he relinquished the appointment of ADOS Malta and was selected as the project officer to set up Central Ordnance Depot Donnington (COD Donnington). This was a major new depot established to manage and hold the Army's technical and warlike stores (weapons, communications, radar, engineer items and similar items) near Telford, Shropshire. It not only reflected the need to create a depot to support a vital stores range of the rapidly mechanising Army but also to replace inadequate and vulnerable storage in Woolwich. After a short sojourn in France as an ADOS at General Headquarters he returned in November 1939 and was promoted colonel and ordnance officer 1st class in the same month.
His drive and experience grew the depot from a greenfield site in 1939. During 1940 the depot was established and at the end of the year de Wolff was appointed commandant and garrison commander with the rank of brigadier. During 1941 and 1942 the depot increased significantly in size and at the end of 1941, 9,600 all ranks worked on the site. He also convinced Wellington District Council to build housing for the civilian staff, many of whom had moved from Woolwich. Eventually 1,500 houses were built outside the COD.
Towards the end of the war, de Wolff "moved to an important but less exacting appointment as DDOS on the Lines of Communication in Italy. But by then the main difficulties had been overcome and to him must go the credit for this great achievement."
He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1945 New Year Honours and retired in July 1946 with the honorary rank of brigadier.
He spent the rest of his life in Malta. An active freemason, he was district grand master of the English District Grand Lodge of Malta until April 1977. He married Ada Marjorie Arnold in 1920.

Generalized Lagrangian mean

In continuum mechanics, the generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) is a formalism – developed by – to unambiguously split a motion into a mean part and an oscillatory part. The method gives a mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian description for the flow field, but appointed to fixed Eulerian coordinates.
Background.
In general, it is difficult to decompose a combined wave–mean motion into with a mean and a wave part, especially for flows bounded by a wavy surface: e.g. in the presence of surface gravity waves or near another undulating bounding surface (like atmospheric flow over mountainous or hilly terrain). However, this splitting of the motion in a wave and mean part is often demanded in mathematical models, when the main interest is in the mean motion – slowly varying at scales much larger than those of the individual undulations. From a series of postulates, arrive at the (GLM) formalism to split the flow: into a generalised Lagrangian mean flow and an oscillatory-flow part. 
The GLM method does not suffer from the strong drawback of the Lagrangian specification of the flow field – following individual fluid parcels – that Lagrangian positions which are initially close gradually drift far apart. In the Lagrangian frame of reference, it therefore becomes often difficult to attribute Lagrangian-mean values to some location in space.
The specification of mean properties for the oscillatory part of the flow, like: Stokes drift, wave action, pseudomomentum and pseudoenergy – and the associated conservation laws – arises naturally when using the GLM method.
The GLM concept can also be incorporated into variational principles of fluid flow.

The Krishna Key

The Krishna Key is a 2012 anthropological thriller by Indian author Ashwin Sanghi and is his third novel. The book follows a history professor who has to prove his innocence against a murder charge.
Plot summary.
"The Krishna Key" centers around Ravi Mohan Saini, the protagonist and a historian who has been accused of the murder of his childhood friend Anil Varshney. In an attempt to clear his name, Saini looks into the past of Indian Mythology's grey areas and uncovers the truth about a serial killer who believes himself to be Kalki, the final avatar of Lord Vishnu. Saini travels from the ancient ruins of the Lost City of Dwaraka to Vrindavan temples in an attempt to discover one of Krishna's treasures and stop the killer from murdering his friends who are also under the threat.
The plot involves four different pieces of the seal which must be brought together to solve the puzzle. Each part of the seal is in the possession of different people who are the descendants of the Yadava tribes namely Saini, Bojaraj, Varshney and Chhedi. The author narrates a detailed version of the post-Mahabharatha history through the protagonist, a distinguished professor of history, who himself happens to be a lineal descendant of Krishna being from Saini tribe of Punjab. The Author also portrays the autobiography of Lord Krishna from his birth to death in his own words, in parallel to the main story-line.
Research.
Sanghi stated that he "wanted to do a story in connection with the Mahabharata, but not retelling of the epic which has already been done" and undertook a month's research, saying that he "had to be extremely cautious in dealing with this topic as we put a premium on personal belief and faith". He chose Krishna as one of the book's themes because Krishna is a "perfectly grey character".

Charlie Murphy is an American singer-songwriter whose album "Catch the Fire" (1981), released on the Good Fairy Productions label, contained the original version of 'Burning Times', later covered by Christy Moore and Roy Bailey (folk singer). The album also contained the LGBT rights anthem 'Gay Spirit'. The album is notable for addressing LGBT issues and pagan spirituality within its lyrics. The song "Burning Times" concerns the persecution of women accused of witchcraft in the Middle Ages and early modern periods. Its chorus mentions several pagan female deities: "Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna". It also mentions that nine million women died, "...in this holocaust against the nature people".
The other key song, "Gay Spirit", expresses the frustration of growing up gay within a prejudiced society: "When we were born they tried to put us in a cage, and tell our bodies what to feel, we have chosen tofeel all the truth, that our bodies do reveal..." The chorus is a rousing burst of optimism: "There's a gay spirit singing in our hearts, leading us through these troubled times, There's a gay spirit moving 'round this land, calling us to a time of open love."

Apokalypsis (Chelsea Wolfe album)

Ἀποκάλυψις, also referred to as Apokalypsis, is the second studio album from American singer-songwriter and eponymous band Chelsea Wolfe, released August 23, 2011.
Writing and composition.
The tracks "Demons" and "Moses" are re-recordings of two songs which previously appeared on Wolfe's previous album "The Grime and The Glow" as "Bounce House Demons" and "Moses," respectively.
Album art.
The album cover, as stated by Wolfe in an interview with "Self-titled Magazine", explained, "with the eyes blanked out in white, is meant to represent a sense of epiphany and the positivity in realizing and accepting truths, whether they are beautiful or hideous."
Reception.
Aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 67% based on 5 critical reviews which indicates "generally favorable reviews".
CMJ's Sasha Patpatia noted, "Songs like 'Wasteland' and 'Pale On Pale' drop the energy and could easily be forgotten among the stronger tracks on the album. The instrumentation on each song, though, is rich and brooding, weaving a distinguishable sound that suitably ties "Apokalypsis" together," adding, "'Movie Screen' is stunning. It seems otherworldly and is the first real sample of Wolfe’s amazing and deep vocal range. This song is the spookiest track on the album, even creepier than 'Primal/Carnal' because it feels much more personal than the horror-film soundtrack." Pitchfork's David Raposa observed, "She's able to approximate the general pallor and stuttering sample-based rhythms of "Dummy"-era Portishead (on 'Movie Screen'), makes like a superfan of Zola Jesus' "The Spoils" (on 'The Wasteland'), apes early PJ Harvey (on the fittingly titled 'Moses'), and even recalls the icy allure and off-kilter harmonies of the Knife (on 'Friedrichshain'). It speaks favorably to Wolfe's abilities that she's able to approximate all these different styles successfully, but these tracks don't say much about who Wolfe actually is."

Enkhelyawon (Mycenaean Greek: , "e-ke-rja-wo") was possibly a Mycenaean king from Pylos in the 13th century BCE.
Enkhelyawon is known from Linear B records from Pylos. He was very important and owned great estates, including good farm land, a thousand grapevines and a thousand fig trees; he also had forty men serving as rowers in the fleet. Because of this it is assumed that he was a king - Mycenaean Greek: "wanax"; Linear B: , "wa-na-ka"; later Greek: , "anax" - and that he ruled over Pylos. But as kings are only mentioned by their title in texts of Linear B, it is not possible to conclusively prove this theory.

A Dark Truth (also known as The Truth) is a 2012 action thriller film directed and written by Damian Lee, and produced by Gary Howsam and Bill Marks. The film stars Andy García, Kim Coates, Deborah Kara Unger, Eva Longoria and Forest Whitaker. It premiered at the 2012 Boston Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United States on January 4, 2013.
Plot.
The film begins with Francisco Francis (Forest Whitaker) running in the jungle with his family while soldiers are shooting and killing people around them. The scene changes to an office building where Tony Green (Steven Bauer) is speaking to Bruce (Kim Coates) in Clearbac corporate offices telling him that Francisco had broken into the local offices and stolen their files. As he converses with Bruce, he orders Renaldo (Devon Bostick), a young aide in his office, to hurry. Renaldo and Tony leave the local offices amid gunfire and chaos, but pause when a woman shouts at Renaldo. She is his mother; she is shot and killed by soldiers as Renaldo looks on. Tony shows his corporate ID to the soldiers and pulls Renaldo into his car. As they attempt to leave the city, they stop at a road block and watch soldiers gun down an unarmed man. Renaldo jumps out of the car and escapes the carnage.
The scene changes to Jack Begosian (Andy García) speaking to call-ins on his radio program in Toronto, Canada, discussing his pessimism about the government and his faith in the goodness of humankind.

2012 Tour of Britain

The 2012 Tour of Britain was the ninth running of the current Tour of Britain and the 73rd British tour in total. The race consisted of eight stages, starting on 9 September in Ipswich, and finishing on 16 September in Guildford. The race was part of the 2012 UCI Europe Tour, and was categorised by the UCI as a 2.1 category race.
The race was won by rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, who became the first British rider to win the race in its current guise and the first to win a British tour since Chris Lillywhite won the 1993 Milk Race, after assuming the race lead with a second place finish on the sixth stage and maintained the lead until the end of the race. Tiernan-Locke won the race by eighteen seconds ahead of Australia's Nathan Haas, riding for the squad, and the podium was rounded out by 's Damiano Caruso, who finished five seconds behind Haas and twenty-three seconds in arrears of Tiernan-Locke.
In the race's other classifications, rider Boy Van Poppel won the points classification for the most consistent finisher in each of the stages; despite not winning any stages, Van Poppel placed four times inside the top three placings of a stage. The mountains classification was won by a rider for the second year in succession, as Kristian House succeeded Tiernan-Locke as the winner; the sprints classification was won by Peter Williams of the team, while won the teams classification.
Teams.
The winner of the 2012 Tour de France, Bradley Wiggins, participated in the race, alongside 2011 World Champion Mark Cavendish for . Two-time Giro d'Italia winner Ivan Basso also contested the race for – the squad making their début in the race – and Samuel Sánchez also competed in the race for the first time as part of the team. Among the domestic teams, Jonathan Tiernan-Locke was the designated leader of the team.
Stages.
Stage 1.
The opening stage of the 2012 Tour of Britain was a primarily flat stage, with the first of the Yodel intermediate sprint points coming in the village of Melton, before the first Škoda King of the Mountains climb came in another Suffolk village, in Snape. The second King of the Mountains point came at the village of Westleton, with the second sprint coming in Great Yarmouth. The final sprint was at Coltishall, with the final King of the Mountains climb coming at Swanton Morley; all three climbs during the stage were third-category ascents. A quartet of riders – 's Niels Wytinck, rider Kristian House, Rony Martias of and Jonathan Clarke, representing the team – made the early breakaway from the field, locking out the top placings at each of the three intermediate sprint points and the three categorised climbs during the stage.
Martias finished first at two of the three sprints, and thus took the race's first sprints jersey, while House earned the polka-dot jersey for heading the mountains classification, and Wytinck earned the award for the day's most combative rider. The breakaway, which had an advantage of seven minutes over the field at one point during the stage, was caught with around remaining, which was expected set up a sprint finish at the Royal Norfolk Showground. However, a large crash with around remaining delayed a large portion of the peloton, leaving few riders to contest the final sprint; rider Luke Rowe prevailed to take his first professional victory ahead of Clarke's team-mate Boy Van Poppel and 's Russell Downing. Rowe took the first leader's jersey by three seconds ahead of Martias, who was sixth on the stage but moved up due to bonus seconds from the intermediate sprints.
Stage 2.
The first sprint point on the second stage was contested just over into the stage, at Duffield. After the sprint point, there were three successive first-category climbs on the parcours, coming at Cross o' th' Hands, Alstonefield and finally Morridge. The two final sprint points were at Chelford and Culcheth with the stage finishing, for the first time, at Knowsley Safari Park on the outskirts of Liverpool. The breakaway for the stage consisted of six riders, and they managed to remain off the front of the field for the majority of the stage. Making up the group were stagiaire Matthias Krizek, Jack Bobridge of , Peter Williams representing the team, 's Richard Handley, rider Russell Hampton and Pablo Urtasun for the squad. The sextet managed to establish a lead of over four minutes at one stage on the roads, but were gradually brought back by the peloton, led once again by with assistance from ; both teams were looking to set up their sprinters Mark Cavendish and Russell Downing respectively.
The leaders managed to remain clear until around ; Bobridge and Williams resisted capture for another few kilometres, but all was together before the to go banner. There were several late-stage attacks from riders representing the domestic teams, but it was ultimately a sprint finish within the safari park for the stage honours. were on the front with race leader Luke Rowe leading out Cavendish, but the pair became separated in the closing stages, allowing Boy Van Poppel () and Bobridge's team-mate Leigh Howard into space. Howard beat a recovering Cavendish to the line for his first win of the year, while a third place for Van Poppel, compared to a tenth for Rowe – with a one-second time gap – allowed Van Poppel to take the lead in the general and points classifications from Rowe. This was despite Rowe receiving the leader's jersey during the post-stage podium ceremonies.
Stage 3.
The third stage of the race started with an almost immediate sprint point, into the stage at Hawick. Like the second stage, there were three successive King of the Mountain points, with two first-category climbs and a second-category climb coming at Roberton, Turner Cleuch and Grey Mare's Tail respectively. The two final sprints were contested at and respectively, at Lochmaben and Whitesands in Dumfries. Following a finishing loop of around in length, the finish of the stage itself was contested on Whitesands for the second successive year; Mark Cavendish led home team-mate Mark Renshaw in a 1–2 finish in the race-opening stage, in 2011.
Five riders were part of the breakaway during the stage; the group consisted of riders mainly from the domestic teams – all bar one of the five – as Bernard Sulzberger of was joined by rider Peter Hawkins, 's Kristian House and Peter Williams, representing the team, with the group completed by stagiaire Wesley Kreder. Williams was looking to defend his lead in the sprints classification, while House was out to regain the lead in the mountains classification, that he had lost the previous day to rider Pablo Urtasun. House ultimately regained his mountains lead with a first and two seconds – both to Sulzberger – while Williams extended his lead with two intermediate sprint wins.
The peloton had given them a maximum advantage of four minutes during the stage, before gradually pulling them back, being led by the team of race leader Boy Van Poppel. Hawkins and Kreder left their breakaway companions behind on the finishing loop around Dumfries, while rider Sep Vanmarcke attacked out of the peloton to join up with the two leaders around later. Hawkins was almost immediately dropped after that, with Kreder and Vanmarcke managing to hold off the peloton until around to go, as the and had ramped up the pace in the peloton ahead of the sprint finish. With a lead-out from opening stage winner Luke Rowe, Cavendish took victory in Dumfries for the second consecutive year, ahead of pairing Leigh Howard and Aidis Kruopis. With six bonus seconds on the line, Howard assumed the overall lead of the race, with Cavendish level on time; Van Poppel fell to third but held on to the lead of the points classification.
Stage 4.
The fourth stage of the race started in Carlisle, where two sprints and two King of the Mountain points were all contested within the first of the stage. The first two sprint points were held at Shap and Kendal, interspersed with two-second-category climbs at Shap Fell and Old Hutton. The final sprint of the day was situated at Caton and the final King of the Mountain point of the day was the third-category climb at Quernmore. The stage finished on the Golden Mile in Blackpool, where André Greipel had won the most recent finish there in the race-opening stage in 2010; the stage scheduled to finish in Blackpool in 2011 was cancelled due to inclement weather conditions after the remnants of Hurricane Katia hit the country. The main breakaway of the day was initiated during the opening kilometres of the stage, and involved six riders.
The group – consisting of mountains classification leader Kristian House (), Ronan McLaughlin of , 's Niklas Gustavsson, rider Dan Craven, Matt Cronshaw of and David Lelay representing the team – quickly gained an advantage of around seven minutes on the peloton, before they started attacking one another with around remaining. House and Gustavsson were initially dropped, while in the peloton, echelons were formed with , reducing the group to twenty-seven riders in depth. McLaughlin and Craven pushed on together off the front, before they were caught with remaining. This ultimately set up a reduced sprint finish, where rider Mark Cavendish won for the second day running, ahead of Australian pair Steele Von Hoff () and race leader Leigh Howard of . Cavendish assumed the race lead from Howard by six seconds, having previously stated that he did not want to hold the leader's jersey, to remain in the world champion's jersey ahead of defending his title in Valkenburg in the Netherlands.
Stage 5.
For the fifth successive year the Tour of Britain held a stage in Stoke-on-Trent, with the fifth stage of the race commencing at Trentham Gardens. The first sprint of the day was contested at only into the stage, at Stone. The second sprint point was situated at Uttoxeter and the final such point was located at Rocester. There were three categorised climbs during the stage, with two-second-category climbs coming in Glacial Boulder – at Cannock Chase – and Oakamoor respectively, while there was also a first-category climb at Gun Hill. The field remained together for the first hour of racing during the stage; at the first intermediate sprint point, 's Leigh Howard took three bonus seconds towards the general classification, ahead of Luke Rowe of and rider Russell Downing.
Three riders – rider Ivan Basso, Bartosz Huzarski of and 's Bernard Sulzberger – were able to break clear before the second climb of the day at Oakamoor, also taking maximum points in the process at both of the intermediate sprints en route to the climb. Strong crosswinds at this point allowed the main field to split apart, forming echelons, and also allowed a group of 21 riders to break clear of the peloton, and ultimately joined up with Basso and Huzarski after Sulzberger was dropped to form a 23-man group. Thirteen of the race's seventeen teams were represented in the group, including four members – Howard, Boy Van Poppel () and pairing Sep Vanmarcke and Nathan Haas – of the overnight top ten in the general classification. The distance between the leaders and the remains of the main field continued to increase, eventually reaching four minutes with around remaining, while race leader Mark Cavendish, of , was four minutes further behind after losing contact on the earlier climbs.
Cavendish eventually lost almost twelve minutes on the day, comfortably losing his race lead. In the lead group, Paul Voss () misjudged a right-hand turn with , with Marc de Maar of and rider Jérémie Galland also hitting the tarmac as a result. Galland had to abandon the race with a fractured collarbone. Galland's team-mate Jérôme Coppel then put in an attack on the group, closely followed by Haas before this was chased down. De Maar, having returned to the group after his fall, went on the attack with and was not brought back as the Curaçao national champion soloed to his first victory of the year by fifteen seconds. Vanmarcke beat out Van Poppel, Haas and Howard for second place, with Howard retaking the leader's gold jersey by seven seconds ahead of Van Poppel.
Stage 6.
The sixth stage started and ended in Wales with a profile similar to the Welsh stages that had been held during previous Tours of Britain, while it was also denoted as the queen stage of the race. Stage 6 also marked one of the hardest days in terms of climbing, with four first-category climbs at Cwm Owen, Brecon Beacons, as well as two ascents of Caerphilly mountain. The three sprint points were contested at , and respectively, located at Kerry, Llandrindod Wells and Mountain Ash. Six riders formed the breakaway for the stage, which was instigated within the opening few kilometres of the stage; it consisted of mountains classification leader Kristian House (), 2011 sprints winner Pieter Ghyllebert of , rider Marcin Bialoblocki, 's Dan Craven, Graham Briggs representing and 's Magnus Bäckstedt. The group held a lead of eight minutes after the first intermediate point in Kerry, which was won by Bialoblocki, before the peloton – led by and – started to gradually cut into their lead.
House continued to extend his mountains classification lead by taking the first two climbs of the day, while the peloton remained four minutes behind at the Brecon Beacons, although the group splintered on the descent from the climb – with eleven riders going clear – before eventually coming back together before the Mountain Ash intermediate sprint. At the foot of Caerphilly mountain, 's Jonathan Tiernan-Locke attacked out of the peloton, surpassing the remnants of the breakaway, with only Briggs catching up with Tiernan-Locke. 's Leopold König linked up with the leaders from a small chasing group, while Ghyllebert tried to rejoin the leaders before being dropped again. Briggs was also dropped with König and Tiernan-Locke remaining clear until the end, where König won the stage and Tiernan-Locke assumed the leader's gold jersey, after 's Leigh Howard finished 33 seconds behind on the stage.
Stage 7.
The penultimate stage of the 2012 Tour of Britain started in north Devon, and contained two first-category climbs at Merrivale and Coffin Stone, as well as a second-category climb at South Hill. The day's intermediate sprint points were heavily favoured towards the latter part of the stage, with the final two sprints both coming within the final of the stage. These were situated at Kingsbridge Promenade and Slapton Ley, with the day's first sprint contested at Great Torrington; the field had remained as one complete entity until this point, where Leigh Howard of reduced the overall lead of rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke by three bonus seconds to ten seconds.
After that, the race split apart on the first climb at South Hill, before eventually reforming; the breakaway was formed during this phase of the race, with ten riders eventually going clear at the front. They eventually established an advantage of around four minutes at its maximum before Tiernan-Locke's squad along with started bringing them back at a gradual rate, falling to 1' 20" with around before the advantage started to increase once again. Tiernan-Locke attacked with around remaining, taking the other race contenders Nathan Haas of and Damiano Caruso () with him. Their group eventually finished 46 seconds down on the stage-winning group of four riders, who had remained out front from the breakaway; Pablo Urtasun took his first win of the season for ahead of fifth stage winner Marc de Maar (), Caruso's team-mate Ivan Basso and team-mate of Urtasun, Samuel Sánchez.
Stage 8.
The final stage of the 2012 Tour of Britain contained four categorised climbs: two third-category climbs at Staple Lane and Crocknorth Road, a second-category climb at Leith Hill and a final first-category climb at Barhatch Lane. Early in the stage there were two sprint points: the first at Dorking just over into the stage, the second on the High Street in the finish town of Guildford; the final sprint of the 2012 Tour was at Ockley. Four riders formed the day's breakaway, consisting of rider Peter Williams – the sprints classification leader, who secured the jersey by getting into the breakaway – as well as 's Wesley Kreder, Jack Bobridge of and Simon Richardson, representing .
The break only got three minutes clear before the peloton gradually brought them back. On the final categorised climb of the race, Barhatch Lane, the overall leader Jonathan Tiernan-Locke () ramped up the pace and split the main field for a time before it eventually reformed on the descent. Bobridge attacked on his own with remaining of the stage, pulling clear by around half a minute before set up station on the front of the peloton to keep Mark Cavendish out of trouble ahead of a likely sprint finish. After Bobridge was caught, three other riders tried solo attacks on the run-in to Guildford without success; setting up the sprint finish, Luke Rowe led it out for Cavendish again, and Cavendish won the sprint – for his third win of the race – by several bike lengths ahead of 's Boy Van Poppel, who secured the points classification on the line. Tiernan-Locke finished within the peloton to secure the overall victory.

Our Greatest Team Parade

The Our Greatest Team Parade was a victory parade to celebrate the achievements of British athletes who competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics. It also recognised the contributions of all the other participants and workers involved in the games. It was held on Monday 10 September 2012 at 1:30pm. The parade took place the day after the closing ceremony of the Paralympics to ensure that the maximum number of athletes were able to participate and to avoid clashing with other commitments.
Planning.
The parade was organised by Mayor of London Boris Johnson in association with the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association. The parade was sponsored by British Airways, BP, BT, the National Lottery and Visa. The Greater London Authority also coordinated the parade with the British Olympic Association, the British Paralympic Association, Transport for London, London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), the Metropolitan Police Service, Westminster City Council, the London Ambulance Service, the London Fire Brigade, Innovision, The Royal Parks, the BBC, Channel 4 and the City of London Corporation. The parade was part of the Look and Celebrations Programme, delivered by the Mayor of London.
Route and viewing areas.
The parade set out from Mansion House at 1:30pm (BST), travelling along Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street, including passing St Paul's Cathedral before passing along Ludgate Hill into Fleet Street and continuing towards Aldwych. It then travelled along The Strand and passed Trafalgar Square, travelling through Admiralty Arch and passing down The Mall before finishing at the Queen Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace. A further celebration also took place outside Buckingham Palace.
As the parade passed Trafalgar Square, a big screen at the base of Nelson's Column allowed live commentary and also allowed the general public to further celebrate the parade.
Stewarded disabled viewing areas were available at Mansion House, St Paul's Cathedral and Trafalgar Square.
Due to the previous day's 2012 Paralympic marathon and also for capacity reasons, the viewing area along The Mall between Admiralty Arch and the Memorial were restricted, reserved and ticketed only for those groups who had made invaluable contributions to the Games and their athletes. The infrastructure from the marathon was reused for the parade. The groups included members of the emergency services, military personnel, Team GB and Paralympics GB coaches and support staff, and friends and family of the athletes involved. Around 1000 school students were also invited, the numbers coming from every London borough with schools that participated in LOCOG Get Set Network. This was to ensure that one in eight 10–18-year-olds could view the parade free of charge. Invitations were also been extended to Team London Ambassadors and volunteers from across the UK. In addition, an estimated 9,000 of the 70,000 volunteers (including Games Makers and Ceremonies Volunteers) won places via a ballot in The Mall in early September. The rest of the Games Makers were encouraged to line the remainder of the parade, wearing their uniforms.
Members of the Royal Family were in attendance, particularly Anne, Princess Royal. Members who were not in attendance were Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry due to other engagements.
Parade and participants.
Around 830 athletes travelled in 21 floats along the parade, with each float carrying around 40 athletes. The number of athletes include 541 athletes from the 2012 Summer Olympics and 289 athletes from the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The floats were arranged by sport and travelled in alphabetical order. The head of the parade was a commissioned carnival group Kinetika and their independent musical group Kinetika Bloco made up of young people from South London, including students from Highshore Special Needs Secondary School. The group consisted of a Brazilian Style Bloco Orchestra, Acrobatic Trickers called the Catchy Shubby Elite, dancers and the theatre group Smoking Apples carrying two giant lion heads, each with the motifs of Team GB and Paralympics GB, going first.
Medal winners were also included throughout the route, including Jessica Ennis, Chris Hoy, Ben Ainslie and Mo Farah.
At any given point the parade took 13 to 15 minutes to pass. The parade between Mansion House and Trafalgar Square took 50 minutes and travelled at approximately 2 mph.
It had previously been suggested that volunteers should have been able to take part in the parade. However the organisers insisted that due to insurance and logistical reasons this was unworkable.
The Mayor of London said:
This is a chance to celebrate the heroes and heroines who have thrilled us with their skills, sportsmanship and grace during London's spectacular Olympic and Paralympic Games, and whose names and triumphs will live on for centuries to come. In the ancient world crowds would line the streets to welcome their triumphant Olympians home, where they would be ecstatically venerated and their victories chronicled for the ages, with names like Leonidas of Rhodes and Milo of Kroton reverberating through history.
Prior to the parade in an interview with "The Daily Telegraph", Laura Trott stated that she thought that the parade was going to be amazing and added:
One of the best things about London 2012 was the fantastic support all Team GB competitors received from the fans at all the venues and from the British public everywhere. It's a chance for all of Team GB to say a huge 'thank you' to everybody out there who has supported us and to thank the people who made the Games possible. Hopefully it'll be a great party atmosphere and a last chance to re-live that great feeling we all experienced together during the Games. We can't wait.
Broadcasting.
The parade was presented live on BBC One, Channel 4 and Sky television networks.
Fly past.
Once the parade had made it up The Mall towards Buckingham Palace, the crowds and Team GB watched a fly past from BA and the Armed Forces consisting of the following;
1st Wave: British Airways A319-131 - G-EUPC
2nd Wave: 1 x Royal Navy Sea King, 2 x Army Lynx, 1 x RAF Puma
3rd Wave: RAF E3D, 2 x RAF Typhoon
4th Wave: RAF Red Arrows
Aftermath.
Prime Minister David Cameron also hosted an event afterwards to commemorate the athletes' achievements.

Fenske-Hall method

In computational chemistry, the Fenske-Hall method is a molecular orbital method usually applied to inorganic compounds. This method was developed in Richard F. Fenske's research group at the University of Wisconsin. The method is named after Fenske and Michael B. Hall, who co-authored the last paper in its development.
The Fenske-Hall method is derived from Roothaan equations. It is "ab initio" in the sense that it does not make use parameters from experimental data (see semi-empirical quantum chemistry method). Electronic exchange is considered, but electron correlation is not. It is able to predict the shapes of molecular orbitals and their energies that are similar to the more rigorous analysis by density functional theory (DFT), but using less computational resources. As a result some consider the Fenske-Hall method an approximation to DFT.
Fenske-Hall calculations may be performed by "Jimp 2".

Jimmy Field

James Morgan Field, known as Jimmy Field (born April 16, 1940), is a part-time attorney in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a Republican former member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The five-member public regulatory agency oversees utilities, trucking, and telecommunications companies. Field was elected to the PSC in 1996 to succeed the Democrat Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette, who became lieutenant governor and subsequently governor from 2004 to 2008.
Background.
A native of New Jersey, Field moved to Baton Rouge as a young child and graduated thereafter from University High School. In 1963, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Louisiana State University. In 1966, he procured his legal credentials from the Louisiana State University Law Center. In the early 1960s, he was a quarterback and outfielder for LSU Tigers football and baseball teams. Field was admitted to the bar in 1966 and specialized in real estate, public utility, commercial, and labor/employment law. He served as a National Football League player representative from 1983 to 2007.
PSC service.
Field was elected to the four years remaining in Blanco's term in 1996 and elected to two six-year terms of his own in 2000 and 2006. His District 2 represents nearly one million inhabitants in portions of East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston St. Martin, and West Baton Rouge parishes as well as all of East Feliciana, Iberia, Lafayette, Lafourche, St. Mary, Terrebonne, and West Feliciana parishes.
Field won the 1996 special election to replace Blanco on the PSC with 52 percent of 344,919 votes cast. He won his first full term in 2000 with 68 percent of the 139,149 votes cast.
Field did not seek reelection in 2012 because of stated family obligations. As a commissioner, Field worked to procure $2 billion in refunds and rate reductions to consumers: "I am especially proud that Louisiana’s residential electric rates are currently among the lowest in the nation." PSC chairman Foster Campbell, a Democrat from Bossier City, said that Field "always had the consumers in mind. But he wanted to be fair to the big companies.”
Five candidates, including three Republicans, sought the seat that Field vacated. The runaway winner in the race was former Lieutenant Governor Scott Angelle of Breaux Bridge, who finished with 213,485 votes (57.2 percent) and carried all thirteen parishes in District 2. The Democrat Forest Wright finished second in the balloting with 76,336 votes (20.5 percent), and Republican State Representative Erich Ponti of Baton Rouge, trailed in third place with 43,287 ballots (11.6 percent). Two other contenders, a Republican and a No Party contender, shared the remaining 11 percent of the vote.

Supetar Cartulary

Supetar cartulary or Sumpetar cartulary () is a 12th-century cartulary which contains charters from the years 1080 to 1187. 
Although the cartulary itself just lists the possessions of the monastery of St. Peter in Poljice, Croatia and the ways through which they were acquired˙(such as purchase or grants), it also contains few important historical notes. It is preserved in its original form. In its basis, the cartulary is actually a chronicle of the Benedictine monastery which was founded around 1080 by a Croatian dignitary and slave owner Petar Crni (Peter the Black).
Today, it is kept in the treasury of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius in Split.

Margareta Gyllenstierna

Margareta Gyllenstierna af Fogelvik (died 1740), was a politically active Swedish countess, married to Arvid Horn, the President of the Privy Council Chancellery (1710–1719 and 1720–1738) and one of the leading figures of the Swedish Age of Liberty.
Gyllenstierna was the daughter of count Nils Karlsson Gyllenstierna and the heir of great estates in Småland and Östergötland. She married Horn in 1710. Margareta Gyllenstierna maintained a political correspondence with the queen of France, Marie Leszczyńska, and the former Polish queen, Catherine Opalińska, both of whom were known as acquaintances of Horn since their stay in Sweden in 1709-1714.
Gyllestierna was among the influential political spouses who collaborated with the French ambassador Charles Louis de Biaudos de Casteja, who was known to engage female agents in Sweden for France, such as Charlotta von Liewen and Hedvig Catharina Lillie. Casteja often mentions her in his reports and refers to her influence of her powerful spouse by describing the political views of Count Horn as the views of the Count and Countess Horn, as if they were one joint politician who shared the position of Arvid Horn. Margareta Gyllenstierna gave Casteja information and analyses about which people who was in a politically favourable position and in favour, and she further more accepted supplicants through Casteja. The collaboration between Gyllenstierna and Casteja was broken on her initiative when the policy of Horn clashed with French interests and she chose the interests of Horn before that of France; she demonstrated her change of attitude by a public show of displeasure when Casteja congratulated her spouse at one of his political achievements.

Paróquia Nossa Senhora do Bom Conselho

Paróquia Nossa Senhora do Bom Conselho is a parish located in the Mooca district of São Paulo, Brazil, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Campo Limpo.
The parish is in the Belém sector of the Archdiocese of São Paulo. It was established on 24 March 1940.
Construction of the church that is now the seat of the parish began in 1973.
Origins.
The church has its origins in the 1960s with the São Luiz Gonzaga college and seminary on the Avenida Paulista in Campo Limpo. The fathers owned a farm in Campo Limpo, growing food for their own use. The college chapel had an image of "Nossa Senhora do Bom Conselho" (Our Lady of Good Counsel) that had come from Italy. A copy of the image was installed in a building on the farm that was used as a garage, but also as a house of prayer and Sunday worship. The area was developed, and the farm was sold to make way for housing, but a site was set aside for church purposes. At first the plan was to build an extension to the college, but this was replaced by a daycare that currently serves 250 children, run by volunteers from the São Luiz Gonzaga college.
Church and parish.
The cornerstone for the church was laid on 1 December 1973, and the church was built mainly using donations raised from people in richer neighborhoods. In November 1983 the Marist fathers Michael Francis Mahoney from New Zealand and Eugen Lasmann from Germany came to the community, and in December 1986 raised the church to become the seat of the parish. In February 1998 the parish merged with the community of Santa Maria Goretti, formerly part of the parish of Nossa Senhora do Carmo. 
Father Sylvestre, who had been the Parish Administrator for seven years, assumed the duties of pastor the parish on 4 July 2010.
Today.
Today about 1,500 people attend weekend Mass, and about 200 parishioners undertake community service.

Temple Beth Israel, now known as Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center, was the first permanent Jewish congregation in the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona. The building was designed in 1920 by architects Lescher, Kibbey, and Mahoney in the style of a Spanish mission. Although Jewish houses of worship are usually aligned on an east-west axis, the Temple Beth Israel axis is north-south.
The congregation sold the property in 1949 to a Chinese-language Baptist Church, and later the building was occupied by a Spanish-language Baptist Church. In 2002, the property was purchased by the Arizona Jewish Historical Society and named for Rabbi Emeritus Albert Plotkin and donor Lawrence Cutler. After a 2008 restoration, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 and was listed as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride.

The Liberal Unionist candidate was 63-year-old Charles McArthur, who had been the MP for Liverpool Exchange from 1897 until his defeat at the 1906 general election.
The Labour Party candidate was 42-year-old John Hill, a Scottish trade unionist who unsuccessfully contested Glasgow Govan at the 1906 general election.
Result.
On a slightly increased turnout, the result was a narrow victory for McArthur, who slightly increased his majority of that won by McIver in 1906.
Aftermath.
McArthur held the seat at the January 1910 general election, but was died in office later that year, triggering another by-election.
Hilll did not stand for Parliament again, but became general secretary of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders in 1909, and served as President of the Trades Union Congress in 1917.

Saidie May

Saidie Adler May (1879 - 1951) was a significant American collector of Surrealist and early Abstract Expressionist art. She was a major benefactor to the Baltimore Museum of Art as well as the San Diego Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Biography.
Saidie Adler was born in Baltimore in February 1879. Her father, Charles Adler, a wealthy shoe manufacturer who had emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1856, built a home in Bolton Hill and sent his three youngest children to attend private school.
May’s early adult life centered on marriage and domesticity. In 1902, she married Albert Carl Lehman of Pittsburgh and gave birth to her son Murray in 1906. She divorced Lehman and married Herbert L. May on October 3, 1922, but this marriage ended in divorce as well.
May preferred a life of independence and art rather than the traditional role of mother and wife. She had the opportunity to travel to Europe in 1924 where she met the artists Hans Hofmann and Alfred Julio Jensen, which had a significant impact on her artistic tastes. Cousins to the Cone sisters, Etta and Claribel, famous for their patronage of the Impressionists, May and her sister Blanche Adler also extensively collected. Although May was an artist who was always learning new techniques and trying different forms, but she was cognizant enough of her talent to realize it was not equivalent to that of the artists she patronized.
In 1933, May closed her Park Lane apartment in New York where she had lived in 1the 1920s and early 1930s and gave much of the art and furnishings to the Baltimore Museum of Art. Seven years later, Saidie A. May made the significant contribution of the Renaissance Room bought from William Randolph Hearst complete with the sculpture of St. Catherine of Alexandria and Giovannidal Ponté’s “St, Anthoney’s Abbot” to her beloved museum.
When Blanche died in 1941, May began to focus on amassing more modern works. She has been described as "particularly adventurous" in her tastes. She helped André Masson and his family escape Nazi occupied France in 1941 and ultimately became a significant collector of his art. May also acquired early pieces of work by Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell (later to become important Abstract Expressionists), namely Pollock's "Water Birds" (1943) and Baziotes' "The Drugged Balloonist" (1942–43). In 1950, Saidie May bestowed the Baltimore Museum of Art $300,000 for a wing dedicated to children, which included an auditorium, gallery, library, staff rooms, and a conference room. Saidie A. May died on May 28, 1951 in New York City.

IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)

The zEC12 microprocessor ("zEnterprise EC12" or just "z12") is a chip made by IBM for their zEnterprise EC12 mainframe computers, announced on August 28, 2012. Manufactured at IBM's East Fishkill, New York fabrication plant, the processor began shipping in the fall of 2012. IBM stated that it is the world's fastest microprocessor and is about 25% faster than its predecessor the z196.
Description.
The chip measures 597.24 mm2 and consists of 2.75 billion transistors fabricated in IBM's 32 nm CMOS silicon on insulator fabrication process, supporting speeds of 5.5 GHz, the highest clock speed CPU ever produced for commercial sale. 
The processor implements the CISC z/Architecture with a superscalar, out-of-order pipeline and some new instructions mainly related to transactional execution. The cores have numerous other enhancements such as better branch prediction, out of order execution and one dedicated co-processor for compression and cryptography. The instruction pipeline has 15 to 17 stages; the instruction queue can hold 40 instructions; and up to 90 instructions can be "in flight". It has six cores, each with a private 64 KB L1 instruction cache, a private 96 KB L1 data cache, a private 1 MB L2 cache instruction cache, and a private 1 MiB L2 data cache. In addition, there is a 48 MB shared L3 cache implemented in eDRAM and controlled by two on-chip L3 cache controllers. There's also an additional shared L1 cache used for compression and cryptography operations.
Each core has six RISC-like execution units, including two integer units, two load-store units, one binary floating point unit and one decimal floating point unit. The zEC12 chip can decode three instructions and execute seven operations in a single clock cycle. Attached to each core is a special co-processor accelerator unit; in the previous z CPU there were two shared by all four cores.
The zEC12 chip has on board multi-channel DDR3 RAM memory controller supporting a RAID like configuration to recover from memory faults. The zEC12 also includes two GX bus controllers for accessing host channel adapters and peripherals.
Shared Cache.
Even though each chip has 48 MB L3 cache shared by the 6 cores and other on-die facilities for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), there are 2 dedicated companion chips called the "Shared Cache" (SC) that each adds 192 MB off-die L4 cache for a total of 384 MB L4 cache. L4 cache is shared by all processors in the book. The SC chips are manufactured on the same process as the zEC12 processor chips, measures 28.4 x 23.9 mm and have 3.3 billion transistors each.
Multi-chip module.
The zEnterprise System EC12 uses multi-chip modules (MCMs) which allows for six zEC12 chips to be on a single module. Each MCM has two shared cache chips allowing processors on the MCM to be connected with 40 GB/s links. One zEC12 chip draws in the region of 300 W and the MCM is cooled by a liquid cooling mechanism capable of 1800 W.
The different models of the zEnterprise System have a different number of active cores. To accomplish this, some processors in each MCM may have its fifth and/or sixth core disabled.
