Cisek

Cisek () is an agricultural village in Kędzierzyn-Koźle County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Cisek. 
It lies approximately south from Kędzierzyn-Koźle and south-east from the regional capital Opole. The village has a population of 1,485.
History.
Before 1945, the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"), however the first mention of the village was in 1241. In 1532, it was named as "Czisky and Cisek". In 1830, the village had 564 residents and 138 houses. By 1845, it had grown to 760 inhabitants and 129 houses. A Roman Catholic school, founded in 1818, employed one teacher and one assistant teacher. In 1865, the total area of the village was 2,037 acres. According to the census of 1910, the village was inhabited by 1,206 Poles. In the census of 1925, the Polish language was listed as the native tongue of 901 villagers, German was only listed by 64 people, and 343 people were recorded as bilingual. 
From 1925 - 1933, a Polish language public school functioned in the village. There was also a branch of the Polish-Catholic School Society. In 1937, the village caused an uproar in the Polish community of Germany due to the county authorities in Koźle denial of a license to suspend the village's newly acquired church tower bells. The bells had been funded by local Polish parishioners. The German authorities had stated that the tower was too weak to hang the heavy bells. Finally, the authorities agreed to suspend the bells after removing the Polish inscription from them which read, "Hail Mary, pray for us." The Union of Poles in Germany also registered two more cases of destruction of Polish inscriptions, which were placed on the roadside crosses, at this time. 
In 1997 the village was heavily effected by the Millennium Flood. The flood destroyed nearly all the season's crops and many roads. The village is partnered with both Breitungen and Körperich in Germany.

Early life.
Danny King was born in Slough, Berkshire, the second son of Michael and Dorothy King. He and his two brothers, Ralph and Robin, lived on the Britwell Estate until 1979, when they moved to Yateley, Hampshire. He attended Yateley School but failed to gain any qualifications before leaving at the age of 16. He stacked shelves for a short stint in the Yateley branch of Somerfield (then Gateway), before working on various building sites as a hod carrier. 
In 1991 he took an Access course at Farnborough College of Technology, which helped him land a place at The London College of Printing studying journalism. Between 1993 and 2002 he worked on various magazine titles, eventually becoming Editor of the Paul Raymond Publications title Mayfair (magazine). He now writes full-time.
In the late 1980s, he was arrested several times and convicted of burglary at Winchester Crown Court and car theft at Camberley Magistrates Court. It is largely due to receiving these convictions that he cites as his reasons for giving education a second go.

Ursula Bagdasarjanz

Ursula Bagdasarjanz (born 1934 in Winterthur) is a Swiss violinist
Early life.
Ursula Bagdasarjanz was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, to a mother who was herself a violinist. The seeds of Ursula's musical talent were sown in the cradle, or, as she herself believes, were bestowed as a gift to accompany her through life. Her father, Samuel Bagdasarjanz was born in Romania, whence his family emigrated to Switzerland. Through her mother, Margrit Weiss, born in Switzerland, Ursula learnt at an early age to express herself on her instrument. In 1944, at the age of ten, Ursula Bagdasarjanz gave her first concert (Beethoven Romance in F major). Her teachers were Aida Stucki in Winterthur, Switzerland (1944–1953), Marcel Reynal at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris, France (1953–1956), where she was awarded the "Premier Prix de Violon" in 1956, and Sándor Végh in Basel, Switzerland (1957 and 1958). She took masterclasses with Joseph Calvet in Paris and Max Rostal in Bern. At the time Ursula Bagdasarjanz was taking violin lessons from Aida Stucki, the latter was herself a student of Carl Flesch, one of the most famous violin educators ever. This was a stroke of luck: as a child, Ursula Bagdasarjanz had already had the chance of familiarising herself with a unique method of work for violinists, the Carl Flesch scale system.
In 2000, another Aida Stucki student, the virtuoso violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, wrote the introduction to Eric Rosenblith's new edition (published in English) to Carl Flesch's book on "The Art of Violin Playing". 
Another violinist having done extensive work on the Carl Flesch's works was Max Rostal. He published a new, revised and broader edition of the scale system in 1987 and passed his in-depth knowledge of the standard works of Carl Flesch on to students attending his masterclasses. 
As both soloist and a chamber musician, Ursula Bagdasarjanz pursued an active concert career. She did much for the composer Othmar Schoeck. She performed a full range of his violin works, including recordings of all his violin sonatas, accompanied by Gisela Schoeck, the composer's daughter.
Concert performance 1956–1982 overview.
Before beginning her studies at the Conservatoire National Supérieur in Paris, Ursula Bagdasarjanz was awarded 1st prize at the Concours Bellan in Paris, France. While still studying, she made her first radio recording with Radio Paris-Inter. Many were to follow with the same station. After having completed her studies with the "Premier Prix de Violon", she returned to Switzerland. Her substantial concert career led her, in addition to solo performances in Switzerland, to a long concert tour in Spain, Germany and Finland, where she became the Turku City Orchestra soloist. In Switzerland, she repeatedly performed as soloist with great orchestras and famous conductors, such as the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich and the city orchestras of Winterthur (in Winterthur, Glarus and Uster), St. Gallen, Aarau, Solothurn and Olten as well as the "Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana". Ursula Bagdasarjanz gave violin concerts and recitals at many music centres abroad: in Switzerland and, among others, in Barcelona, Berlin, Heidelberg, Darmstadt, Zurich, Winterthur, Geneva, Schaffhausen, Basel, Bern, Rorschach, Rapperswil, Herisau, and Stans. Her recordings in the radio studios of Zurich, Lugano, Paris and Berlin contributed significantly to making her more renowned as a Swiss soloist. 
Ursula Bagdasarjanz performed as soloist and narrator in a ZDF TV documentary, which introduced the public to a Swiss industrialist's pre-eminent collection of Stradivarius instruments. She was also part of the "Tonhalle Wettbewerb Zurich" jury (competition by Tonhalle Zurich).
In July 2001, 2002 and in 2004, Ursula Bagdasarjanz was invited to Romania to give violin master classes in Târgu-Mureş. She was also member of the jury of the Constantin Silvestri music competition. Ursula Bagdasarjanz gave an interview to radio Bucureşti. Her CDs are highly appreciated.
Her long co-operation with the pianist Gisela Schoeck, the daughter of the composer Othmar Schoeck, should be particularly noted. In addition, in June 1995, Ursula Bagdasarjanz was heard with Dr. Knaus on "Musik à la Carte", the Swiss Radio DRS broadcast, accompanied by music pieces from her CDs.

CD reviews.
"The Strad, August 2009, by Julian Haylock. 
Recordings by the legendary violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz (b. 1934) are much prized by contemporary collectors, most especially her 1961 cycle of Othmar Schoeck's complete music for violin and piano with the composer's gifted daughter Gisela (Gallo CD-1249). The second volume in a reissue of these classic radio tapes features the op.22 variations an the op.16 and 46 sonatas in performances so authoritative and responsive to the music's remote idiom (think Hindemith with added warmth and charm) that it is impossible to imagine them ever being superseded. The mono recordings have been transferred most expertly, with plenty of body to the sound and a smooth treble response."

Chez Bagdasarjanz and Gisela Schoeck, the first sonata's lyricism and crackling high spirits awaken to sheer vivacity; the second's rumination's and eeriness acquire a mordant and suddenly compelling conviction, lifting both works into a dimension only half-heartedly hinted at in other readings. The early 1905 sonata without opus number takes on a heretofore unexpected charm. Rescued from Swiss radio tapes made in 1961, Gallo's sound is close, well balanced, and detailed. A companion issue featuring Bagdasarjanz performing Schoeck's Violin Concerto with the Lugano Radio Symphony (Gallo CD-1250) exhibits a similar nuance-rife fluency, while one hopes that more tapes of Gisela Schoeck will surface - her brilliance and swagger through the sonatas make one avid to hear her again in any repertoire. Enthusiastically recommended. – Adrian Corleonis"

Accompanying the volatile, inspired violinistics of Ursula Bagdasarjanz, Gisela Schoeck animates her father’s violin sonatas with an expressive flair beside which even the most sympathetic performances of all other would-be interpreters seem stodgy, academic. These artifacts raise the question once again, If one has heard a work only in competently clueless, professionally respectable performances, has one really heard it?"

Current Reviews - Early, Classical and Beyond
Volume One features works by Bach, Nardini, Mozart and Bartok, recorded between 1960 and 1969, and demonstrates not only Bagdasarjanz’s performance range but also the consistent elements in her playing: a big, warm tone; faultless intonation; a fairly heavy (but not wide) vibrato which is always used intelligently and sensitively; and a sophisticated sense of phrasing. The Bach A minor solo sonata is technically flawless, with a great sense of line and some remarkably tight triple-stopping in the Fuga. The big tone is evident in the Nardini D major sonata, the Mozart Bb major sonata K378, and Bartok’s First Rhapsody. The piano sound is slightly fuzzy in the Nardini, but otherwise the transfers are excellent.
"By far the most significant of the two CDs, however, is Volume Two, which features the complete works for violin and piano by the Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck. Recorded for Swiss Radio in 1961, only 4 years after the composer’s death, the three sonatas feature Schoeck’s daughter Gisela as the accompanist in performances that The Strad magazine rightly called “so authoritative… that it is impossible to imagine them ever being superseded.” All three sonatas – Op.16, Op.22 and Op.46 - are not part of the standard repertoire and are rarely performed these days, which is a real shame; the first two in particular, dating from the early 1900s, are strongly personal works reminiscent of Brahms and Franck. Again, the re-mastered sound is excellent."
"If you know Bagdasarjanz’s playing – and recordings of her have always been pretty scarce – then you won’t need to be told to get these CDs; if you don’t know her playing, get them anyway – you won’t be disappointed!"

SCHOECK Violin Sonatas 
Ursula Badgasarjanz (violin), Gisela Schoeck (piano) 
Gallo 1249, 50 minutes 
Othmar Schoeck (1886-1957) was one of Switzerland’s leading composers in the first half of the 20th Century. These works for violin show the influence of Brahms and a good deal of technical proficiency. While Schoeck lacked the trailblazing imagination of the very greatest composers, his themes are lovely, his harmonic knowledge has an impressive range, and his material is expertly worked out. These are satisfying works, and as I listen to them I never feel that they are lacking. Of the three works presented here, the First and Second Violin Sonatas are the best. The Second is more harmonically fluid, but the First has stronger themes and is more affecting. The Variations, without opus number, don’t hold my interest as well. They are from 1905, the earliest of the three works, so that comes as no surprise. Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz recorded these pieces for Swiss radio in 1961. The composer’s daughter Gisela plays the piano and does a very fine job. The sound is a bit dry, and I wish the piano were a bit more forward, but these are very good readings."

"Ursula Bagdasarjanz: The fifth volume of Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz's CD-collection" 
The fifth volume of Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz’s collection of studio and live recordings on the Gallo label contains three sonatas, one each by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johannes Brahms. She and pianist Luciano Sgrizzi recorded Mozart’s Sonata in G Major in Studio Lugano in April 1963; the engineers surrounded the duo with very little reverberation and Bagdasarjanz sounds very close up, but the realistic recorded sound virtually places a listener in the room (or places the listener in a virtual room) with the musicians. In general, Bagdasarjanz combines rhythmic incisiveness with almost period starchiness tonally and stylistically. But her vibrant sense of and fidelity to what she obviously believes to be the music’s rhetoric combine to make her reading of ­Mozart commanding and, ultimately, convincing — especially in the first movement, in which she reveals an unsuspected urgency. Not so suave in Mozart as Arthur Grumiaux or so sharply focused on detail as Catherine Mackintosh, she combines the best aspects of both approaches and deserves on the basis of this reading to be mentioned alongside them on any shortlist of Mozart interpreters.
The live performances of Beethoven’s and Brahms’s sonatas with pianist Bruno F. Saladin come from 1964, approximately the same date as the studio recording of Mozart. Caught at a greater distance in them, her tone loses some of its edge and her reading correspondingly loses some of its detail, but there’s enough left for any normal recorded sound. Her reading of the “Kreutzer” Sonata takes a very different tack than that of Jascha Heifetz or Zino Francescatti, whose performances set a sort of benchmark in white-hot intensity; Bagdasarjanz seems from the first notes of the introduction warm rather than hot. Her reading, for example, of what I’ve called the Janissary theme doesn’t rollick with whipped-up frenzy, but presents a different and, again, as in Mozart, a convincing, though kinder and gentler, view. Not that the reading lacks the passion that might inspire a novel, but it’s diverted through calmer and more amiable streams. Bagdasarjanz plays the theme of the variation movement with a warmth, subtlety, and geniality that sound like Fritz Kreisler’s — except that Kreisler himself played the theme more straightforwardly and with greater rhythmic springiness. That geniality continues through the first two variations (Bagdasarjanz sounds particularly silvery in the second of them), but she and Saladin dim the lights for the minore variation. The following maggiore serves in this reading almost as a Hegelian synthesis of the preceding two, while the Molto adagio sums everything up in a penetrating synopsis. If the somewhat slow tempo at the finale’s opening makes the reading sound less urgent at its outset, her tonal weight and general storminess still generate plenty of driving force.
Bagdasarjanz soars in the first movement of Brahms’s sonata; her reading never seems undesirably light in weight or tone (an analogous predication in the terms of scholastic philosophy). In fact, her tone, though pure and mercurial in the upper registers, remains almost seductively dusky in the lower ones. In the slow movement’s opening passages, it oozes with honeyed richness. Only very occasionally does security falter in the third movement (but it’s a live recording); on the other hand, the brisk reading of the finale sweeps everything before it with concerto-like massiveness.
Bagdasarjanz’s recital, assembled from various sources, makes a satisfying whole, not least because of the violinist’s integrity and insight into each of the styles she channels. Very strongly recommended as playing of the very first order, in music of the very first order: a wonderful way of encountering Bagdasarjanz, either for the first time or on a repeat visit. – Robert Maxham"

Violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz, who has said, "I get my energy from music: it is the breath that gives rhythm to my life," is, as a concert performer, virtuoso and pedagogue, one of the most prominent figures in Swiss musical life. For the culmination of her international career, she has put together a collection of CDs with radio and digitally remastered recordings (2008-2011), as well as a live recording. In this fifth volume, accompanied by pianist Luciano Sgrizzi, she performs Mozart’s Sonata in G Major, K. 302 (1963, Studio Lugano), with remarkable sonority and sensitivity; and with pianist Bruno F. Saladin, Beethoven’s famous "Kreutzer" Sonata in A Major, op. 47, and Brahms’s Sonata in D Minor, op. 108, both recorded live in 1964. These are lovely reminders of a glorious musical and artistic past, whose future is assured by this disc, which will delight violinists well beyond the borders of Switzerland."

Roberts Ancāns

Roberts Ancāns (11 November 1919 – 1 January 1982) was an Obersturmführer in the Waffen SS during World War II. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Roberts Ancāns was born on 11 November 1919, in Tilža parish, Latvia. In 1938 he started law studies in Latvian university. In the autumn 1939 he volunteered in Latvian army. Ancāns was member of Latvian student fraternity "Lacuania".
World War.
Ancāns was in the Latvian Army in 1940, and during the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) he volunteered to join the first Latvian units in July 1941 and the Waffen SS in February 1942. He was among those Latvian soldiers who were trapped in Kholm Pocket in early 1942. There he was wounded and after treatment served in the Latvian Legion near Leningrad, in the Volchov marshes and at the Velikaya river.
After the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) was formed, he became part of the 19th Reserve Battalion.
In the fighting of the Courland pocket on 24 December 1944, with his company of 180 men, they destroyed a Soviet attack aimed at the point where the 19th SS and the 21st Luftwaffe Field Division met, and they also destroyed 12 tanks in the process.
After the 19th SS and the 21st Luftwaffe divisions had been withdrawn, Ancāns' company had been reduced to 38 men, most of them seriously wounded. For his bravery and leadership in the battle he was awarded the Knight's Cross. In May 1945, he was seriously wounded and evacuated from the pocket.
Post war.
Ancāns survived the war and until 1955 lived in West Germany, but then emigrated to the United States. He died in New York on 1 January 1982.
Miscellaneous.
The Latvian Legion's attachment to the SS, unit designations and ranks were considered a formality. Latvian and Estonian soldiers, regardless of whether they volunteered or were drafted, were not members of the Nazi party.
In 1949-50, United States Displaced Persons Commission investigated the Estonian and Latvian "SS" and found these military units to be neither criminal nor Nazi collaborators. On 12 September 1950, Harry N. Rosenfield, the United Nations Refugee Relief Association commissioner, wrote to Jūlijs Feldmanis, Latvia's chargé d'affaires in Washington, saying that «the Waffen-SS units of the Baltic States (the Baltic Legions) are to be seen as units that stood apart and were different from the German SS in terms of goals, ideologies, operations and constitution, and the Commission does not, therefore, consider them to be a movement that is hostile to the government of the United States under Section 13 of the Displaced Persons Act, as amended.»

William Dennison was an Oxford academic and administrator. He was a contested Master of University College, Oxford.
Contested Mastership of University College.
On the death of the previous Master of University College, Arthur Charlett, on 4 November 1722, the position of Master was contested by two men, Thomas Cockman and William Dennison. Dennison was previously a Percy Fellow at University College. In the first election on 4 December 1722, Thomas Cockman was elected by a narrow margin. A formal complaint was made to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University that the election was contrary to the statutes. Another election was organised, at which Dennison presided. Dennison was elected on 17 December 1722. However, Cockman's name had already been formally recorded as Master of the College. Both men complained to the Vice-Chancellor and a decision was made in favour of Dennison. The situation escalated with an appeal to the Crown. The issue was not finalised until 1729 when it was resolved in favour of Thomas Cockman rather than Dennison. This was the only time in University College's history when it had two Masters.

Kaza, Himachal Pradesh

The town of Kaza, Kaze or Kaja is the subdivisional headquarters of the remote Spiti Valley in the Lahaul and Spiti district of the state of Himachal Pradesh in the Western Himalayas of India. Spiti, which is a part of the Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal, is a high altitude or cold desert having close similarities to the neighbouring Tibet and Ladakh regions in terms of terrain, climate and the Buddhist culture. Kaza, situated along the Spiti River river at an elevation of above mean sea level, is the largest township and commercial center of the valley .
Description.
The town is divided into the old, as Kaza" Khas" and new as Kaza "Soma" sections. The new town contains the administrative buildings. The Tangyud (Tang-rGyud) Gompa dates to the early 14th century and is built like a fortified castle with massive slanted mud walls and battlements with vertical red ochre and white vertical stripes. It is on the edge of a deep canyon and overlooking the town of Kaza, 4 km from the town. Approaching it from the south one sees Kyu-ling ("Skyid-gling"), the stately palace of the Nono (king) on the other side of the river.
Access.
Kaza is overlooked by high mountain ridges on all sides. It has two access points : one from Kinnaur valley and the other from the Lahaul valley, 11 km from Ki Monastery, the famous Gelugpa establishment. The route through Kinnaur is open throughout the year, except for occasional short periods resulting from landslides or heavy snowfall. This road, starting from Shimla, follows the Sutlej river unto a little beyond Reckong Peo, thereafter turning northwards to follow the Spiti river all the way to Kaza. The other road starts from Manali and after crossing the high Rohtang Pass to reach Gramphoo where it joins the road from Keylong and proceeds south along Chandra River till Batal then climbs up to cross the high Kunzum pass, enters the Spiti valley to reach Kaza. It remains closed during winter months, normally from October end to June due to heavy snowfall on both the passes.[http://www.himachaltourism.org/tourist-attractions/lahaul-spiti.html].Kaza is among the coldest place in India. The temperature varies greatly in a different seasons and during a day, January is the coldest period of a year with an average temperature of -37°C,while the July is hottest month with an average temperature of 13°C.
Tourism.
Kaza is known for its colorful festivals and the ancient Sakya Tangyud Monastery in a side valley, 4 km from the town. It is also popular with tourists and adventure seekers during summer months because of its central location and connections to rest of the valley and outside. This central location also makes Kaza an ideal base camp for trekking, mountaineering and tours directed to other parts of the valley.Some of the major tourist attractions in and around Kaza beside Tangyud Monastery are the Key Gompa, Kibber village at an elevation of 4205 Mtrs. above MSL,Gette Village at an altitude of 4270 Mtrs. above MSL,Langza village famous for presents of marine fossils, the Pin Valley National Park, a protected area for himalayan high altitude wildlife and the Losar village 60 km to the north of Kaza at an altitude of 4079 Mtrs. above MSL.

List of largest poker tournaments in history (by prize pool)

For the last eight years, the largest tournament in the world has been the World Series of Poker Main Event. With the exception of 1992, the US$10,000 buy-in tournament has increased in prize pool year-over-year from its start in 1970 until 2007 (the latter a result of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which reduced the number of players winning their seats via online play).
The first tournament to reach a million dollar prize pool was the 1983 WSOP Main Event. The WSOP Main Event of 2004 had the first prize pool of above $10,000,000.
The largest non Hold'em Tournament has been the 2008 WSOP $50K HORSE with a prize pool of $7,104,000 and the first prize of $1,989,120 going to Scotty Nguyen.
Below are the 30 largest poker tournaments with respect to the prize pool in United States dollars and not number of entrants. This list includes live and online poker.
Currently, the nine largest prize pools in history have been WSOP Main Events. The largest prize pool outside of the Main Event is the 2012 WSOP event known as The Big One for One Drop, held from July 1–3. It featured a buy-in of US$1 million, the largest in poker history. Of the buy-in, $111,111 was a charitable donation to the One Drop Foundation, and the WSOP took no rake. All 48 seats available for that event were filled, resulting in a prize pool of $42,666,672. The largest pool for any event outside of the WSOP was the 2012 Macau High Stakes Challenge, with a HK$2 million (US$260,000) buy-in plus a rebuy option. The event drew a field of 73, of which 21 made a rebuy, resulting in a prize pool of HK$182,360,000 (slightly over US$23.5 million).
All of the 30 richest tournaments to date were played in No Limit Hold'em.

Seth Sendashonga

Seth Sendashonga (1951–1998) was the Minister of the Interior in the government of national unity in Rwanda, following the military victory of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) after the 1994 genocide. One of the politically moderate Hutus in the National Unity Cabinet, he became increasingly disenchanted with the RPF and was eventually forced from office in 1995 after criticizing government policies. After surviving a 1996 assassination attempt while in exile in Kenya, he was launched a new opposition movement, the Forces de Résistance pour la Démocratie (FRD). Sendashonga was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in May 1998.
Biography.
Sendashonga was a leader of a student movement opposed to the rule of Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana and been forced to leave the country in 1975. In 1992 Sendashonga joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the rebel group then fighting the Rwandan Civil War against the Habariyamana government. The RPF took power after defeating the Hutu Power-led government that carried out the Rwandan Genocide. Sendashonga was able to use his considerable personal prestige to convince other Hutu moderates to joint the RPF government.
Minister of the Interior.
Following their victory, the RPF created a Government of National Unity in July 1994, and invited Sendashonga, a politically moderate Hutu, to be the Minister of the Interior. For much of his tenure, Sendashonga had written a barrage of memos to Kagame about killings and forced disappearances that were reported to have been carried out by elements of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). On 19 April 1995, Sendashonga rushed to Kibeho in an attempt to calm the situation after RPA soldiers shot several Hutus in an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp. After returning to Kigali, he briefed Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President/Defense Minister Paul Kagame and sought assurances that the RPA would exercise restraint. Following the massacre of a large number of IDPs at Kibeho on the 22nd, the RPA refused Sendashonga entry to the area.
After his attempt to seek redress for the victims of Kibeho was turned down, Sendashonga came to the conclusion that the 'Ugandan Tutsi' who controlled the RPF would not tolerate any dissent and were willing to carry out mass murder to achieve their goals. However, both Sendashonga and Twagiramungu, also a Hutu, thought that the situation might be salvaged as the political split did not precisely mirror ethnic lines; some Francophone Tutsi politicians in the RPF felt excluded by the English-speaking Tutsis who had come from Uganda. Sendashonga decided to take a stand against arbitrary arrests after 15 prisoners had suffocated to death after being detained some days after Kibeho, stating, while cautiously referring to detainees as 'criminals', "Of late many criminals have been arrested following the closure of Kibeho camp, thus making the prisons full beyond their capacity." This infuriated Kagame, who some days before had given a speech proclaiming, "Over 95% of the former Kibeho people have returned to their homes and are in good shape." Tensions in the cabinet worsened after Rose Kabuye, mayor of Kigali, announced the creation of city residency permits that would be given "only to blameless persons" and would be color-coded green for old residents and blue for refugees returning from Zaire, who were suspected of being associated with the old Hutu regime. This announcement panicked the Hutu populace, who rushed to get this vital document, before Sendashonga canceled the entire permit plan through his authority over the Interior Department.
By this point, the RPF Department of Military Intelligence had leaked a memo to the press that stated that Sendashonga, Minister of Finance Marc Ruganera and Vice Prime Minister Col. Alexis Kanyaregwe, all Hutus, were under their watch. As the killings and disappearances continued without any pause, Sendashonga made the dramatic decision to disband the Local Defense Forces (LDF), which had been set up to replace the police after the genocide but were subsequently linked to a large number of arrests, murders and disappearances. However, the LDF was the tool the RPF used to keep track of rural areas, further aggravating Defense Minister Kagame. As a minister, the government could not attack Sendashonga directly, but the RPF began to accuse Sendashonga's brother of various misdeeds. As things reached a breaking point, Twagiramungu called a special council of ministers on security matters that began on August 23. Running for three days, the meeting turned into a conflict between Kagame and Sendashonga, who received the backing of Twagiramungu, Ruganera and, somewhat surprisingly, Aloysia Inyumba, the Tutsi minister of women's affairs. In the final showdown, Twagiramungu confronted Kagame about how, of the 145 "bourgmestres" appointed by the RPF, 117 were Tutsi, to which Kagame left the room, ending the meeting. Over 95% of the February/March nominees for posts at the local administration levels of "paroisse", "commune", and "préfecture" were 'foreign' Tutsi.
Two days later, Prime Minister Twagiramungu resigned, but was outmaneuvered by President Bizimungu, who did not want him to leave the government on his own terms. On 28 August, Bizimungu came before Parliament and asked for a public vote that succeeded in firing Twagiramungu. The next day, Sendashonga, Minister of Transport and Communications Immaculée Kayumba, Minister of Justice Alphonse-Marie Nkubito and Minister of Information Jean-Baptiste Nkuriyingoma were fired. Sendashonga and Twagiramungu were placed under house arrest and their documents examined for any incriminating evidence, but were eventually allowed to leave the country unharmed by the end of the year.
Exile and assassination attempt.
Sendashonga went into exile in Nairobi, Kenya. There he planned to fly to Brussels, Belgium to launch a new opposition movement called the Forces de Résistance pour la Démocratie (FRD) with his old colleague and fellow Hutu moderate Faustin Twagiramungu. In February 1996, Sendashonga received a call from a fellow Rwandan exile offering to give him documents proving that there had been an attempted mutiny within the RPF. When he went to the appointment, he was met by two men who ambushed him, hitting him twice with bullets fired from pistols. His life was not endangered, but his nephew, who was with him, was seriously injured. Sendashonga recognized one of the would-be assassins as his former bodyguard from when he was a minister. The other was Francis Mgabo, a staff member at the local Rwandan embassy, who was subsequently discovered attempting to dispose of the pistol he had used in the attack in the restroom of a local gas station. The government of Kenya asked Rwanda to withdraw Mgabo's diplomatic immunity so he could be arrested and put on trial. Rwanda refused, resulting in a row between the two countries in which Kenya closed the Rwanda embassy and the two countries temporarily broke off diplomatic relations.
After recovering from his wounds, Sendashonga carried out his plan to start the FRD opposition party in Brussels. French historian Gérard Prunier states that the party platform, which included an in-depth critique of the 1994 genocide, was "a very valuable contribution because it was an honest and realistic assessment of the genocide from a mostly Hutu political group." However, Sendashonga's assertion that the enemy was not the Tutsi, but rather the RPF under Kagame, was subject to harsh criticism by other Hutu politicians who accused him of being weak. Conversely, Sendashonga said of the former genocidaire Hutu leadership in refugee camps of Zaire, "Their only political program is to kill Tutsis." At the same time, several of his old Tutsi colleagues in the RPF continued to feed him information about events within Rwanda, apparently in the belief that he would be needed once again once the violence had run its course.
However, Sendashonga realized that only the groups using violence were shaping events, stating to Prunier, "Everybody uses a gun as a way of sitting at the negotiation table one day. If I always refuse to use guns, I'll be marginalized when the time comes." Sendashonga had attracted about 600 soldiers and 40 officers of the old Rwandan Armed Forces, who were willing to fight for him because they saw him as an alternative to the RPF and the Hutu Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, whom they felt were motivated by opposing forms of violent racism. After Tanzania agreed to host Sendashonga's rebel training camps, he used his contacts with Prunier to go to Uganda and talk to Salim Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's brother, on 3 May 1998. Relations between Uganda and Rwanda had deteriorated and Salim was open to the idea of a new force to counter the RPF. Sendashonga then met Eva Rodgers of the United States Department of State, who was noncommittal but did not outright oppose the formation of the new armed group.
Assassination.
On 16 May 1998, at about 5 pm, Sendashonga was being driven home in his wife's United Nations Environmental Programme car when he was shot and killed, along with his driver Jean-Bosco Nkurubukeye, by two gunmen firing AK-47s. Twagiramungu, still in Brussels, declared, "I'm pointing to the RPF and its government" and was echoed by a number of other exiled political groups, though the RPF government denied any involvement.
Three men, David Kiwanuka, Charles Muhaji and Christopher Lubanga were arrested by the Kenyan police. Kiwanuka was claimed to be Rwandan, despite his typically Muganda name, while Muhaji and Lubanga were identified as Ugandan. The three had been identified, in what Prunier derides as a story "obviously fed by rather untalented Kigali security operatives", by Kenyan taxi driver Ali Abdul Nasser, who claimed that the three men had tried to hire him as a paid killer because Sendashonga had stolen $54 million in a criminal partnership with Kiwanuka's father, who the Nairobi police claimed to have been the Director of Immigration Services in Kigali, and who had subsequently been supposedly killed by Sendasonga so he would not have to share the loot. This story ran into serious problems when the actual Director of Immigration Services, a man named Charles Butera, surfaced to state that he was alive, that he had no son named Kiwanuka, that he knew Sendashonga only as a brief acquaintance, and that nobody had ever stolen $54 million.
Despite the problems with the Kenyan criminal case, the three men remained in jail until 31 May 2001, when they were released from jail by a court. In a December 2000 hearing, Sendashonga's widow, Cyriaque Nikuze, claimed that the Rwandan government was behind the assassination and revealed that he had been scheduled to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the French Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. Sendashonga, who had agreed to testify for the defense in the trial of Obed Ruzindana, would have been the first current or former member of the RPF to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal. Nikuze claims that the Rwandan embassy official Alphonse Mbayire, who was the acting ambassador at the time, organized the assassination. Mbayire was recalled by his government in January 2001, immediately after Nikuze's accusation and shortly before a new hearing was to begin, only to be shot dead by unidentified gunmen in a Kigali bar on 7 February 2001.

Žanis Butkus

Žanis Butkus (July 29, 1906 – May 15, 1999) was a Latvian Hauptsturmführer (Captain) in the Waffen SS during World War II. Butkus was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Žanis Butkus was born on 29 July 1906, in Augstkalne, Latvia to Fricis and Anna Butkus. After leaving school, he worked on his parents farm. He joined the Latvian Army in 1927 and remained in the military until 1929. Butkus was renowned for his shooting abilities, as he won numerous championships throughout Latvia and the Baltic region. In 1932 he married a Latvian girl, Velta, with whom he had four daughters, Ulla, Inta, Mirdza and Marga. Ulla and Inta emigrated to the United States, while Marga and Mirdza remained in Latvia.
World War II.
In 1941, after the Red Army's occupation of Latvia his wife and daughter were deported to Siberia. Butkus joined the national partisans to fight against the Soviet forces until the Germans invaded the territory of Latvia.
In August 1943 on the Volchov Front, Butkus led an assault team into the Soviet lines and proceeded to capture a string of bunkers, without suffering a single casualty. His force soon returned to the German lines with numerous prisoners and a substantial amount of equipment. Butkus was given a commission on the spot and later having taken part in 59 close combat engagements, Butkus was awarded the Knight's Cross.
He survived the war and died on 15 May 1999 in Palmer, Alaska.
Miscellaneous.
The Latvian Legion's attachment to the SS, unit designations and ranks were considered a formality. Latvian and Estonian soldiers regardless of whether they volunteered or were drafted, were not members of the Nazi party.
In 1949-50, United States Displaced Persons Commission investigated the Estonian and Latvian SS and found these military units to be neither criminal nor Nazi collaborators. On 12 September 1950, Harry N. Rosenfield, the United Nations Refugee Relief Association commissioner, wrote to Jūlijs Feldmanis, Latvia's chargé d'affaires in Washington, saying that "the Waffen-SS units of the Baltic States (the Baltic Legions) are to be seen as units that stood apart and were different from the German SS in terms of goals, ideologies, operations and constitution, and the Commission does not, therefore, consider them to be a movement that is hostile to the government of the United States under Section 13 of the Displaced Persons Act, as amended."

Siftable

Siftables are small computers that display graphics on their top surface and sense one another and how they are being moved. Siftables were developed as a platform for hands-on interactions with digital information and media and were the prototype for Sifteo cubes.
Siftables were created by David Merrill and Jeevan Kalanithi when they were graduate students at the MIT Media Lab. Merrill and Kalanithi are friends from their undergraduate years at Stanford, where they both majored in symbolic systems, Merrill focusing on human-computer interaction and Kalanithi on artificial intelligence and neuroscience.
Merrill and Kalanithi were surrounded by colleagues at the Media Lab who were working on wireless sensor networks (e.g. the Tribble project,) and tangible user interfaces (e.g. Topobo ). Merrill and Kalanithi wanted to create a general-purpose tangible user interface that leveraged the technologies of wireless sensor networks. From this idea came the idea of interactive tiles that would enable people to interact with collections of virtual objects—digital pictures, document files, etc.—in the same way that people interact with collections of small physical objects like LEGOs —another common sight at the Media Lab.
The initial applications envisioned for Siftables were organizing personal media (digital photos, songs, videos) and facilitating business processes, such as coordinating people, distributing tasks, and creating Gantt charts. 
Merrill was invited to present Siftables at the 2009 TED Conference, held in Long Beach / Palm Springs February 3-7, 2009. During his talk, he demonstrated several applications on Siftables: portraits that reacted to being placed next to one another, mixing colors from "paint buckets" on adjacent cubes, building the Fibonacci sequence with an arithmetic application, creating words by arranging individual letters, an interactive graphical narrative for children, and constructing a music sequence. The video of Merrill's TED talk quickly went viral once online, attracting over 1 million views. With this indication of widespread interest in the concept of Siftables, Merrill and Kalanithi decided to focus on developing Siftables into a retail product.
The transformation of Siftables into Sifteo cubes (the retail product sold by Sifteo, Inc.) required a complete re-implementation of code and hardware. While the underlying capabilities—the ability to sense tilting, shaking, rotation, and neighboring—of Siftables and Sifteo cubes are the same, the technology behind them is significantly different.

Copyright Act 1911

The Copyright Act 1911, also known as the Imperial Copyright Act of 1911, is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (UK) which received Royal Assent on 16 December 1911. The act established copyright law in the UK and the British Empire. The act amended existing UK copyright law, as recommended by a Royal Commission in 1878 and repealed all previous copyright legislation that had been in force in the UK. The act also implemented changes arising from the first revision of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1908.
The act came into force in the UK on 1 July 1912, in the Channel Islands (except Jersey) on 1 July 1912, in Jersey on 8 March 1913, and in the Isle of Man on 5 July 1912. The Copyright Act 1911 applied or extended to all parts of the British Empire. In India the act came into force on 30 October 1912, in Papua on 1 February 1931, and all other British possessions on 1 July 1912. It was subsequently enacted on various dates in the self-governing dominions and "territories under protection" of the British Empire. "The Copyright act 1911 (extension to Palestine), 1924" covered Palestine and later Israel, where in the latter it remained the governing statute until the Israeli 2007 Copyright Act took effect in May 2008.
The Act.
In the two centuries after the Statute of Anne of 1710, which afforded copyright protection to books, other works were afforded copyright protection either through case law, as in the case of music, or through Acts of Parliament, as in the case of engravings, paintings, drawings and photographs, in legislation such as the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 and the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862.
The Copyright Act 1911 consolidated previous copyright statutes, and apart from minor exceptions, the Copyright Act 1911 repealed all previous copyright legislation and established a single statute covering all forms of copyright.
The 1911 Act implemented the Berne Convention, which abolished the common law copyright in unpublished works and responded to technological developments by conferring copyright on a new type of works not mentioned in the Berne Convention, namely sound recordings.
The 1911 Act abolished the need for registration at the Stationers' Hall and provided that copyright is established upon the creation of a work. However, as the 1911 Act come into effect at different times in different countries of the Commonwealth, registration at Stationers' Hall continued to be required in some Commonwealth countries after 1911. The Act also stated that copyright arose in the act of creation, not the act of publishing.
The scope of copyright was further widened and producers of sound recordings were granted the exclusive right to prevent other reproducing their recordings, or playing them in public. The act provided that the copyright in literary, dramatic and music works could be infringed by the making of a film or other mechanical performance incorporating the copyrighted works.
Summary of changes.
British lawyer Evan James Macgillivray summarised the changes in the introduction of his annotated edition of the 1911 Act as follows:
Imperial copyright act.
With the exception of provisions that were expressly restricted to the United Kingdom by the act, all provisions of the Copyright Act 1911 applied "throughout His Majesty's dominions" and self-governing dominions if enacted by the parliament of that dominion without modifications that were not necessary to adapt the act "to the circumstances of the dominion". The Copyright Act 1911 was adapted to circumstances and enacted by the then self-governing dominions of Australia (Copyright Act 1912), Newfoundland (Newfoundland Copyright Act 1912) and the Union of South Africa (Patents, Designs, Trade Marks and Copyright Act 1916).
The Copyright Act 1911 also provided that the UK Secretary of State could certify copyright laws passed in any self-governing dominion if the copyright legislation was “substantially identical” to those of the Copyright Act 1911. Though the Secretary of State could certify copyright law even if their provisions on copyright enforcement and the restriction on importation of works manufactured in “foreign countries” were not identical to that of the Copyright Act 1911. Such self-governing dominions were then treated as if the Copyright Act 1911 extended to the self-governing dominion. The Secretary of State certified the copyright laws of New Zealand (New Zealand Copyright Act 1913, certified April 1914) and Canada (Copyright Act of Canada 1923, certified 1923).
The Copyright Act 1911 also provided that “His Majesty may, by Order in Council, extend this Act to any territories under his protection and to Cyprus” and the act would then apply to these countries as if they were dominions of the British Empire. In 1912 an Order in Council extended the Copyright Act 1911 to Cyprus and the following territories: Bechuanaland, East Africa, The Gambia, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Northern Nigeria, the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Somaliland, Southern Nigeria, the Solomon Islands, Swaziland, Uganda and Weihaiwei. The Copyright Act 1911 was extended to Palestine by an Order in Council in 1924, it was extended to Tanganyika by an Order in Council in 1924 and 1931, it was extended to the Federated Malay States by an Order in Council in 1931 and 1932, and it was extended to the Cameroons under British Mandate by an Order in Council in 1933.
Influence of the act.
The Copyright Act 1911 provided the template for an approach to copyright exceptions where a specific list of exceptions carefully defines permitted uses of the copyrighted work. The 1911 Act formed the basis of UK copyright law and, as an imperial measure, formed the basis for copyright law in most of what were then British colonies and dominions. While many of these countries have had their own copyright law for a considerable number of years, most have followed the imperial model developed in 1911. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa define the limits on and exceptions to copyright by providing an exhaustive list of specifically defined exceptions.
Commonwealth approach to exceptions.
This "Commonwealth approach" to copyright is in contrast with that adopted in US copyright law. US copyright does contain a number of specific exceptions, as well as providing for a fair use defence in section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976. The Section provides a list of illustrative example of uses under this defence, such as criticism, comment and research. In contrast to the Commonwealth fair dealing exceptions, the fair use defence allows US courts to find that a defendant's use is fair and hence not an infringement of copyright, even though the use does not fall within the statutory list provided for in Section 107.

Harold Rosen (educationalist)

Harold Rosen (25 June 1919 – 31 July 2008) was an American-born British educationalist who lived for most of his life in the UK. His particular field was the teaching of English, and he eventually became an academic at the Institute of Education, part of London University.
He was a Communist activist in the 1930s; after World War II, he became an English teacher and later a teacher trainer; he became a major figure in leftwing thinking in education after leaving the Communist Party in 1957; and he played an important part in debates and developments in the fields of language teaching and Primary education, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.
Biography.
Origins and youth.
Harold Rosen was born at Brockton, Massachusetts, on 25 June 1919. His mother, Rose, was a Communist activist from the East End of London. Her mother's father and his own father were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, and his mother's father had joined the Social Democratic Federation, Britain's first independent socialist party. When Rosen was two years old, his parents separated, and he was taken to the East End by his mother. He was brought up in a mainly observant Jewish environment but in a strongly secular and Communist home. He recalled: "The whole family were atheists. But my grandfather had a very sophisticated approach to how to relate to the majority of people who were religious. He was very hard on religion but did not make futile gestures to offend religious people." Rosen was educated at the local state elementary and grammar schools.
In 1935, Rosen joined the Young Communist League (Britain), youth wing of the Communist Party of Great Britain. There he met Connie Isakofsky. Their emotional, political and professional relationship, and later marriage, were to last until her death from cancer in 1976. They had three sons, Brian (1942–), Alan (1944–1945) and the poet and broadcaster Michael Rosen (1946–).
Together Harold and Connie took part in the Battle of Cable Street in 1936, defending the East End against a march by the Anti-Semitic British Union of Fascists.
Teacher.
Rosen studied English at University College, London, gaining his degree in 1940. Being an American citizen, he was not subject to UK conscription, and went into teaching, working in a number of schools. In 1945 he was drafted into the US Army and served in the education corps in Germany.
After his discharge, Rosen took his post-graduate certificate of education at the University of London Institute of Education, where he was a keen sportsman in rugby union and track events. He then taught at Harrow Weald Grammar School, in Middlesex. There he met James Britton and Nancy Martin, who were closely concerned with the development of children's language, and who became his major inspiration and later collaborators. Moving for a shortwhile to Leicestershire, he and Connie made the family home in Pinner. Teaching in Greenford he found his career stalled by the blacklisting of communists. Throughout this period he was an outspoken critic of British colonial policy.
When the London County Council launched its great initiative in comprehensive education, Rosen moved to Walworth School in south-east London, a pilot comprehensive just off the Old Kent Road. He was Head of English from 1956 to 1958, where he put the teaching of English on fresh basis, moving from merely studying language to using it. This period coincided with his final disenchantment with the CPGB, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary and his disagreements with the Party over structure and organisation. He left the party in 1957, adopting many of the perspectives (without actually joining any particular group) of the New Left, associated with E.P. Thompson, who were strongly interested in problems of class consciousness and working class self-activity, dialectics and praxis.
The theory and practice that were worked out at Walworth are the principal contributions associated with Rosen. Essentially, he demanded that teachers reshape the curriculum to respect the experience and culture brought to the curriculum process by the student. The fundamental part of the learning process is the construction of meaning through language. This is brought about through a dialogue between learners and teachers, and among learners themselves.
However, the socialist humanism of the New Left was complemented by a strong strand of traditional humanism. Rosen was a major proponent of modern literature in education, bringing works by novelists like J. D. Salinger and William Golding into classrooms still largely dominated by the work of earlier centuries.
Teacher of teachers.
Rosen left Walworth to begin a career in teacher education. He worked first in the Borough Road Teacher Training College in Isleworth, Middlesex, and later in the London Institute of Education, where Britton and Martin were highly influential. At first as their collaborator, and later as head of the English department and professor, Rosen became a major influence in teacher training and the teaching of English. Much of his direct influence was exercised through the London Association for the Teaching of English (LATE), which provided a forum for the capital's teachers and teacher trainers.
A major product of this collaborative work was a report "Language, the Learner and the School", he wrote with Britton (by this time at Goldsmith's College) and Douglas Barnes of Leeds, and first issued in 1969. While Barnes contributed a penetrating study of actual language use in the classroom, and Britton a paper on the importance of oral language development, Rosen wrote on behalf of LATE, opening up the question of policy. He called for schools to develop a "language policy across the curriculum" that would embed a collaborative and language-focussed model in all subjects and affect every aspect of school life. "The Language of Primary School Children" (1973) was a collaborative project between Harold and Connie, his wife, under the auspices of the Schools Council. It incorporated research across many local education authorities to present a detailed picture of how language was hammered out in social interactions. This time a special focus was placed on the potential of educational drama. The rise in the number of students from minority ethnic groups brought new challenges, which he welcomed, encouraging teachers to develop new tactics within the general strategy of getting into students' lives and culture. Connie and Harold were strongly influenced in this work by their own critical reading of the sociolinguists Basil Bernstein and William Labov.
These writings played a vital role in stimulating wide debate about the role of language in education and helped force the government to set up an enquiry into the subject. This led to the Bullock Report (A Language for Life) which conceded one of Rosen's major objectives: "Each school should have an organised policy for language across the curriculum, establishing every teacher's involvement in language and reading development throughout the years of schooling."
Later years.
Rosen remained engaged and interested in every aspect of education and politics to the end of his life. After Connie died in 1976, he married Betty, an English teacher, in 1978, and it was she who cared for him in his last years. He lived to see his son Michael become Children's Laureate in 2007, while his son Brian has worked most of his life at the Natural History Museum in London and has made major contributions to research and exhibitions there, particularly in the field of marine palaeontology and ecology.[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-rosen/10/763/42]
Rosen became a founder member of the Society for Storytelling. His passion for narrative remained compelled him to pass on his own story. Partly this was embodied in his memoir "Are You Still Circumcised?: East End Memories". For most of his life, he wrote poetry. A small selection was published in 2003 called "Choose Your Frog". He remained a passionate critic of US and UK foreign policy and a supporter of the Palestinian cause. Rosen was interviewed in 2004 and 2005 as part of the Social Change and English, 1945–1965 project, an oral history study of developments in English teaching in post-war secondary schools. Sections of these interviews have now been published.

Reńska Wieś , German: Reinschdorf, is a village in Kędzierzyn-Koźle County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland in the region of Upper Silesia. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) of the same name. It lies approximately south-west of Kędzierzyn-Koźle and south of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). Though a large part of the area's German population was expelled after Silesia was annexed by Poland, a substantial German population remained in this commune; thus, since 2006 the village, like most of the surrounding area, has been officially bilingual in German and Polish.
The village has a population of 1,800.
History.
The village was first mentioned in 1532 as Rinska. Since 1742, after the defeat of Austria in the First Silesian War, Reinschdorf belonged to Prussia and in 1816 it was assigned to Landkreis Cosel.
The early 19th and 20th centuries saw a revival of the town, as Reinschdorf was located on the road between Leobschütz and Cosel, which had become one of the largest inland ports in the German Empire. In 1864 a large sugar mill was built in the town, and in 1882 Reinschdorf was connected to the rail network.
Until 1928, the town was parochially administered by the parish of St. Sigismund in Cosel. Though a small neo-Gothic chapel was built in 1861, the town only received its own church in 1924-1926. The present Church of St. Urban was built in 1979-1980.
In the Upper Silesian plebiscite of 20 March 1921, 940 villagers (87.6%) voted to remain with Germany, while only 133 people voted to join the newly created state of Poland. As a result, Reinschdorf remained in Germany as part of the Weimar Republic.
After the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the village, and the town was renamed Reńska Wies as part of a campaign to Polonize Silesia, which had been annexed to Poland as agreed at the Yalta Conference. However, since unlike many other areas of Silesia the German population had not been completely expelled, there remained a substantial German minority, and since 26 October 2006 the town and commune have been officially bilingual. On January 11, 2011 the old German name Reinschdorf was again made official.

Lichfield Court

Lichfield Court, in Richmond, London, consists of two Grade II listed purpose-built blocks of flats. Designed by Bertram Carter and built in fine Streamline Moderne style, it was completed in 1935. 
Lichfield Court is built on the site of Lichfield House which was reputedly designed by Christopher Wren; built for George Nevill, 1st Earl of Abergavenny, it later became the palace for the Bishop of Lichfield. Mary Elizabeth Braddon (1837–1915), novelist, lived at Lichfield House from 1901 and died there. The house and grounds were acquired in 1933 by George Broadbridge and redeveloped into the present two blocks of flats.
The company estate office and porters’ office are situated in the main lobby of the major block. The buildings are surrounded by estate grounds which are a mix of gardens and unallocated parking, the major block having a decorative inner courtyard garden and pond. Initially intended for the rental market, the flats conformed to six different types ranging from studio flats with no alcove, to studio flats with one alcove or two alcoves, and one to three bedroom flats, some with balconies.
Listed status.
The buildings were awarded grade II listing in January 2004. The Twentieth Century Society reported the listing, saying:

Lichfield Court was used as Gerda's flat in the TV adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe".

Regiment of Artillery

The Regiment of Artillery is an operational arm (a regiment/corps) of the Indian Army. Formerly part of Royal Indian Artillery (RIA) of British Indian Army which itself traces its origins to the formation of Bombay Artillery in 1827. It was later involved in extensive service in the First World War, in East Africa, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia and Palestine .
Today it is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, and with its guns, mortars, rocket launchers, unmanned aerial vehicles, surveillance systems, missiles and artillery firepower it constitutes almost one-sixth of its total strength.
History.
Historically Mughal Emperor Babur is popularly credited with introduction of Artillery in India, in the Battle of Panipat in 1526, where he decisively used gunpowder firearms and field artillery and defeated the much larger army of Ibrahim Lodhi, the ruler of the large North Indian Delhi Sultanate, thus not just laying the foundation of the Mughal Empire but also setting a precedent of all future battles in the subcontinent. However evidence of earlier use of gun by Bahmani Kings in the 'Battle of Adoni' in 1368 and King Mohammed Shah of Gujarat in fifteenth century have been recorded.
The East India Company raised the first regular company of Artillery in 1748, with a small percentage of Indian Gunners called Gun Lashkars, Tindals and Serangs. A few Indian mountain artillery batteries, officered by the British, were raised in the 19th century and formed part of the Royal Artillery. The Royal Indian Artillery (RIA) of the British India Army, was raised on September 28, 1827, as a part of the Bombay Army, a presidency army of the Bombay Presidency. It was later renamed as 5 Bombay Mountain Battery, and participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–1842). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was sparked off in Meerut on 10 May 1857, primarily by native artillery of Bengal Army, following which all Indian artillery units were banned except mountain artillery batteries, though Major Richard Keatinge of Bombay Artillery was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1858 for his service during the Indian Rebellion. 
In the 20th century, the Artillery was later involved in extensive service in the First World War, in East Africa, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.
The Regiment of Artillery was raised on 15 January 1935, when the first three Indian Field Regiments, originally numbered A, B, and C were authorised. Originally called the 'Indian Regiment of Artillery', which later became 'The Regiment of Indian Artillery' on 1 November 1940 and 'Royal Regiment of Indian Artillery' in October 1945, after its success in World War II.
After the partition of India in 1947 RIA was divided between the newly formed artillery regiments of India and Pakistan. In the coming years the artillery took part in all the operations fought by the Indian Army, the latest being the Kargil War.
The School of Artillery of the Indian Army is situated at Devlali near Nashik, and the Regiment of Artillery Museum, established in 1970, is also situated in Nashik at Nasik Road Camp.
The Regiment of Artillery was divided in the mid-1990s between the Field Artillery, the Corps of Air Defence Artillery formed in January 1994, and the Army Aviation Corps formed in November 1993. The Field Artillery is the largest successor branch, with 190 regiments, but no longer accounted for a sixth of the army's 1.2 million 1996 strength.
Jane's Defence Weekly said in 1996 that divisional artillery deployed on India's plains is expected to have a mix of 130mm and 155mm guns. This could be a combination of three 130mm regiments and one regiment of 155mm guns, or two regiments of each calibre, depending on the anticipated threat and whether the division is to be employed for offensive or defensive operations.
On 15 January 1985, a commemorative stamp depicting a Gunner and Howitzer from Mountain Battery was released by India Post, on the Golden Jubilee of the Regiment of Artillery

Background.
Following the earlier national history "Shoku Nihon Kōki" (869), in 871 Emperor Seiwa ordered the compilation of the years since then. It was primarily edited by Fujiwara no Mototsune with assistance from Minabuchi no Toshina, Ōe Otondo, Shimada no Tadaomi, Sugawara no Koreyoshi, Yoshibuchi no Yoshinari, and significant contributions by Miyako no Yoshika. The text was completed in 879.
Contents.
Written in Kanbun-style and contained within ten volumes, the contents cover nine years of Emperor Montoku's reign spanning from 850 through 858. The text is characteristic in that it contains few political details but many obituaries for nobles.

Dobra , German Dobrau is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Strzeleczki (Gemeinde Klein Strehlitz), within Krapkowice County, Opole Voivodeship, in region of Upper Silesia in southwestern Poland. It lies approximately south-east of Strzeleczki, west of Krapkowice, and south of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany. Since 2006 the village, like the surrounding commune, has been officially bilingual in German and Polish. The nearby hamlet of Nowy Bud (Neubude), with a population of 82 people, is administered by this village.
History.
Dobrau is one of the oldest towns in the region, first mentioned in 1258. The name of the town derives from a Slavic word for "good", and referred to the fertile soil of the area. Since 1780 the village was in the possession of Count Heinrich Seherr-Thoss, one of the biggest landowners in Silesia, who had a castle nearby. In 1867 the Catholic church was built with a donation from Countess Olga Seherr-Thoss. On the outside of the church is the tombstone of the knight Kasper Rogowski (d.1611), surrounded by eight heraldic crests.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 419 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 76 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. In the Dobrau Gutsbezirk, the local municipal council, 80 people voted for Germany and six for Poland. As a result, Dobrau remained in Germany. In 1933 the village had grown to 796 inhabitants. On 21 July 1936 the town was renamed Burgwasser. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. During WWII the village was partially destroyed, first from 25–27 January and then again on 19 March 1945, when the historic palace was burned by the advancing Red Army.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Dobrau was largely expelled, dramatically reducing the town's population; it has not since reached its former size. The village was renamed Dobra and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 it was reassigned to Opole Voivodeship, and in 1999 reassigned from Prudnik County (formerly Neustadt O.S.) to Krapkowice County. On 17 May 2006 the entire commune of Strzelecki/Klein Strehlitz was declared bilingual in German and Polish, and on 24 November 2008 the old name German name Dobrau was also made official.
Near the village are the ruins of the neogothic Schloss Dobrau, built in 1720 for the Sehher-Thoss family and rebuilt 1857-60. The palace gardens were designed by Gustav Meyer, architect of many of Berlin's finest gardens, and contain many fine old trees. The palace, destroyed by the Russian army in 1945, is now in private hands and being renovated.

The village has a population of 476 people. The nearby hamlet of Nowy Młyn (Neumühle), with a population of 48 people, is administered as part of this village.
History.
The village of Komornik was first mentioned in 1245 by Duke Ladislaus I of Opole, who had provided it as a base for the construction of the Cisterian abbey at Lubiąż. Later on, however, the village was divided into two parts; one half was claimed by the Cisterians, which in 1810 became property of the Prussian state, while the second part belonged to the Oppersdorff family of Oberglogau.
The parish church in Komorniki was built in 1888 by Fr. Zarub, largely with funds collected from his predecessor, Fr. Jachnik. The temple was founded on the site of the old church, which had been demolished. The old Stations of the Cross were moved from the previous church.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Komornik was largely expelled. On 17 May 2006 the entire commune of Strzeleczki/Klein Strehlitz was declared bilingual in German and Polish, and on 24 November 2008 the old name German name Komornik was also made official.

The village has a population of 700 people.
History.
The first mention of the village dates to 1383, when the Piast Prince Ladislaus II titled himself as Duke of Opole, Prudnik, Dobra, and Kujawy. The name of the village also appears in a tithing register in 1447. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S.
A parish was founded in Kujawy in the 14th century, when the original church, probably made of wood, was built. The current Church of the Holy Trinity dates to the sixteenth century, and was built in a Renaissance style. The new church was built out of stone and plaster. After the expansion it took the form of a three-name, basilica type church. The church contains many late Renaissance wall paintings, and on the vault are two angels with an Arma Christi display. The church has a wooden, late Baroque altar from the second half of the 18th century, and a Renaissance pulpit from the 16th. In the temple are many historic liturgical objects and bronze candlesticks. The church also has an historic register of marriages, with the oldest records dating to the sixteenth century and made in Polish and German. There is also a palace and park near the town, formerly belonging to an old, landowning family, which were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are now privately own.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Kujau was largely expelled. The town was renamed Kujawy and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 it was reassigned to Opole Voivodeship, and in 1999 reassigned from Prudnik County (formerly Neustadt O.S.) to Krapkowice County.

History.
The village had already invested in German town law in the early 13th century, and was first mentioned in written documents as Lofcovici in 1218. It was later named in 1534 as Lowkowitz. The name is thought to derive from the name Łowek. During the Middle Ages the town frequently changed hands, before finally in 1561 passing to the Oppersdorff family of Oberglogau. In 1936 the Nazi government renamed the village Jägershausen because of its Slavic-sounding name. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S.
The village windmill was built in 1868 of brick, and was recently renovated by a private owner and converted into a restaurant. The town park and palace, dating to the late 19th century and built for a landowning family, are privately owned. The town chapel, also built of brick, also dates to the 19th century.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Lobkowitz was largely expelled. The village was renamed Łowkowice and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship.

Michael Kutzop (born 24 March 1955 in Lubliniec, Silesia, Poland) is a former German football player of Polish origin. He spent seven seasons in the Bundesliga with Kickers Offenbach and SV Werder Bremen.
Kutzop took arguably the most famous penalty kick in the history of Bundesliga. On the penultimate game day of the 1985–86 season Kutzop's league-leading SV Werder Bremen were playing second-placed FC Bayern Munich. Werder's victory in that game would guarantee them the title. With the score of 0–0 Kutzop took the penalty kick in the 88th minute and hit the right goalpost. The game ended 0–0. On the last game day FC Bayern beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 6–0, Werder lost 1–2 to VfB Stuttgart (the team they beat 6–0 earlier in the season) and Bayern took the title on goal difference. That was the only penalty kick he missed in 40 attempts during his Bundesliga years.
Today he works at Rudi Völler's football school in Cala Millor, Majorca, Spain.

Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). Since 2006 the village, like the rest of the commune, has been officially bilingual in German and Polish.
The village has a population of 362 people. The nearby hamlet of Buława (Buhlau), with a population of 120 inhabitants, is administered jointly with this village.
History.
The village was first established in the Middle Ages. The name of the village was first recorded in 1285 as Villa Scriptoris, Latin for "Scribe's village". In 1383 its name was recorded by a traveller as Schreibersdorff in German and Pisarcowice in Polish. From 1428 the village belonged to the Cisterian monastery at Leubus. After a period of changing ownership, in 1646 it came under the control of the powerful Oppersdorff family of Oberglogau, who retained ownership of the village until the end of WWII.
The parish church of St. Michael, originally known as the Church of St. Nicholas, was first built in the Middle Ages, and first mentioned in 1301. The church was enlarged around 1600, then renovated in 1784, 1858, and 1950. It has Renaissance and Silesian Baroque elements, and was built of brick and stone. The church has many historical objects of worship, including a 16th-century crucifix and a Baroque monstrance of the 17th century. In the church is the 1548 tombstone of local governor, Nicholas Lesoty, a work of Reinaissance design with a bas-relief stone knight. Around the church stretches a medieval stone wall. There is also a large manor house near the village, built in the mid-18th century in the late Baroque style for a local landowning family. It has a very impressive grand staircase and private chapel. It is currently private property.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 419 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 76 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. In the Dobrau Gutsbezirk, the local municipal council, 80 people voted for Germany and six for Poland. As a result, Dobrau remained in Germany.

Shifting City

Shifting City is an album by John Foxx and Louis Gordon, released in 1997 (although some sources cite 1995 as the release year). Released simultaneously with Foxx's ambient album "Cathedral Oceans", "Shifting City" was Foxx's first album release since "In Mysterious Ways" (1985).
Stylistically "Shifting City" marked a return to the electronic sound of Foxx's 1980 solo album "Metamatic", although it also shows an influence of 1960s The Beatles-style psychedelia, a style which Foxx had already experimented with on 1983's "The Golden Section".
A 2 CD special edition was released in October 2009, including three previously unreleased bonus tracks. Disc Two of this special re-issue contains the previously released “The Omnidelic Exotour” material, recorded live by Foxx and Gordon at A Certain Ratio's Warehouse in Ancoats, Manchester and at Metamatic Studio in 1997.

Smolarnia, Opole Voivodeship

Smolarnia , German Pechhütte is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Strzeleczki (Gemeinde Klein Strehlitz), within Krapkowice County, Opole Voivodeship, in Upper Silesia in south-western Poland. It lies approximately west of Strzeleczki, west of Krapkowice, and south-west of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). Since 2006 the village, like the entire commune, has been bilingual in German and Polish.
The village has a population of 252 inhabitants. The nearby hamlet of Serwitut (Servitut), with a population of 69 people, is administered as part of this village.
History.
The village can trace its history back to 12 November 1663, when a large estate was granted to a nobleman which later became the center of the new town, attracting settlers from nearby villages. The village's name was first recorded as Dziedzützer Pechhüte, indicating it was a hamlet of Dziedzice (as was nearby Servitut). Its name derives from the pitch industry that occupied the villagers. The Polish name, Smolarnia, does not appear before the 19th century, and was first recorded in an official record from 1828. The parish church for Pechhütte and Servitut was in Polnisch Rasselwitz.
German documents of the early 19th century do not provide separate census data for Pechhütte and Servitut, but in the 1830s there were counted between Pechhütte, Servitut, and Sedschütz 44 households with 420 inhabitants. By the 1890s there were 25 families living in the village. However, there was very little arable land, as much of the area was taken up by the forest, an Easement property called the "Oberglogauer Servitutwald" because it was owned by the wealthy Oppersdorff family from Oberglogau. So, many of the villagers had to work in the forest and on nearby estates. In WWI several soldiers from the village died, but the village itself, like most of Germany, was untouched by physical damage. In 1915, Pechhütte and Servitut had 1111 inhabitants.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 541 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 321 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. As a result, Pechhütte remained in Germany. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. Up until 1945 the forest around Pechhütte, by then known as the "Sedschützer Servitutwald" belonged to Count Klaus von Tiele-Winkler of Moschen. During the war, the town suffered minimal damage, with only the school burning down.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Pechhütte was largely expelled, dramatically reducing the town's population; it has not since reached its former size. The village was renamed Smolarnia and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 it was reassigned to Opole Voivodeship, and in 1999 reassigned from Prudnik County (formerly Neustadt O.S.) to Krapkowice County. On 17 May 2006 the entire commune of Strzelecki/Klein Strehlitz was declared bilingual in German and Polish, and on 24 November 2008 the old name German name Pechhütte was also made official.
In the center of the town is a memorial to the soldiers from Pechhütte killed in World War I and II.

Strzeleczki , German Klein Strehlitz is a village in Krapkowice County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Strzeleczki (Gemeinde Klein Strehlitz). It lies approximately west of Krapkowice and south of the regional capital Opole.
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II"). Since 2006 the village, like the entire county, has been officially bilingual in German and Polish.
The village has a population of 1,598. The village has one of the highest concentrations of Germans in Poland, with 18 of 20 seats on the municipal council filled by Germans.
History.
This ancient market town was probably founded in the mid 13th century, around the year 1250; the first documentary mention dates to the year 1327. Its name, first recorded as Strelicz is thought to derive from a Slavic word for "archers". In 1531 the town's name was recorded in a Latin form as Parva Streletz, and in 1535 as Klein Streletz in German. This was to distinguish it from the nearby town of (Groß) Strehlitz.
The town received German town law in 1327; by this point the village was already quite large with a parish church, and since 1375 a school functioned in the village - one of the oldest in Upper Silesia. On March 13, 1428, the village was looted and burned by the Hussites. The city was again destroyed by Swedish forces during the 30 Years War in 1642.
In 1742 Klein Strehlitz came under Prussian control. In 1750 the village lost its town rights. When the Archipresbyteriate of Oberglogau was divided, Klein Strehlitz was left with a dean, and until today there is a small deanery in the town. The inhabitants of Klein Strehlitz were always Catholic; in the census of 1861, there were 1370 Catholics, 13 Protestants, and 15 Jews. Before they died out in 1769 the town belonged to the counts of Proskau, passing then to the counts of Schelitz, and then in 1789 to the Prussian state. Until 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 1381 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 198 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. As a result, Klein Strehlitz remained in Germany. In 1939 the village had 1875 inhabitants.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Klein Strehlitz was largely expelled. The village was renamed Strzeleczki and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 it was reassigned to Opole Voivodeship, and in 1999 reassigned from Prudnik County (formerly Neustadt O.S.) to Krapkowice County. On 17 May 2006 the entire commune of Strzelecki/Klein Strehlitz was declared bilingual in German and Polish, and on 24 November 2008 the old name German name Klein Strehlitz was also made official.
The coat of arms of the town most likely comes from the Barons of Promnitz-Pless. The current emblem is based on a drawing made by Heraldic artist Otto Hupp in 1898.
The film producer Lothar Stark was born in the village.
There is a war memorial in the center of the town that commemorates the soldiers from Klein Strehlitz who died in World Wars I and II.

History.
The village was first mentioned in 1679 as Wawrzinowice.

Initially the village was in the possession of the noble House of Schaffgotsch, then in 1821 it passed to Baron Seherr-Thoss, who sold it in the 1860s to Major Thiele-Winckler von Miechowitz, whose family owned the village until WWII. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S.
In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Lorenzdorf was largely expelled. The village was renamed Wawrzyńcowice and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship.

Protection Efforts.
Canadian environmental officials have known for decades the closed Tulsequah Chief Mine leaks acids into the Tulsequah River and ultimately into the Taku River and have monitored the site and issued several orders for cleanup since 1989. In July 2009, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin wrote a letter to B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell urging him to collaborate with Alaska in an effort to mediate the mine leakage.
An Alaska organization, Rivers Without Borders, has been working to gain legislative protection for the Taku River on the Alaska side, an effort driven in part by the mine's waste flowing into the Tulsequah River.

TOA Technologies

TOA Technologies provides Software as a Service-based mobile field service management software and customer appointment scheduling solutions and services to enterprises worldwide. Headquartered in Beachwood, Ohio, the company develops, markets and sells ETAdirect, a web-based applications solution that provides advanced tools for companies with small, medium and large mobile workforces to automate and optimize planning, scheduling, appointment booking, as well as routing and job allocation and real-time management of any type of field service event. ETAdirect include applications for forecasting, capacity management, routing, real-time field management/dispatch and an advanced HTML 5-based mobility app for field employees. It also includes apps for collaboration, location-based information and customer communications.
ETAdirect.
ETAdirect is powered by a patented algorithm that continuously learns mobile employees’ work patterns, analyzes them statistically and uses pattern recognition to accurately predict an employee's time of arrival at a customer's location and the length that each job/appointment will take, thereby providing enhanced accuracy for planning and customer experience management. ETAdirect typically narrows the wait window to less than 60 minutes. Using time-based predictions, ETAdirect can communicate to consumers the exact time that a field service employee will arrive via voice/IVR, email, text/sms, Twitter and other communications channels, reducing customer frustration, wasted time and inquiry calls to service provider call centers. The software is delivered to businesses over the Internet using a software as a service/eSaaS model.
ETAdirect is currently used by seven of the top ten cable companies in North America, including Cox Communications, as well as major broadband operators in Europe, such as Virgin Media and ONO (Spain).
Company Information.
TOA Technologies was founded by Yuval Brisker and Irad Carmi in 2003. The company is privately held and employs more than 450 employees worldwide and is headquartered in the "Silicon Suburb" of Beachwood, Ohio, with additional offices in Miami, Florida, London, United Kingdom, Paris, France, Munich, Germany and Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Principal venture shareholders are Technology Crossover Ventures, Draper Triangle Ventures (a DFJ network affiliate), Intel Capital and Sutter Hill Ventures.
TOA stands for "Time of Arrival." The concept of time is central to the ETAdirect software solution set, as its central algorithm measures time and predicts performance based on resource specific pattern recognition and advanced predictive analytics. This yields more accurate time of arrival estimates than the alternative of managing service appointments according to averages of human resource capabilities and availability.
As of December 2013, TOA had over 85,000 users.
Patents.
On April 6, 2010, TOA was issued U.S. Patent No. 7,693,735 entitled "Dynamic Schedule Mediation" for its predictive, performance-pattern based mobile workforce management system and proactive customer communications methodology.
Milestones.
In October 2012, Gartner recognized TOA Technologies as a Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Field Service Management for the first time. TOA Technologies was again named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Field Service Management in 2013. It stated that the company will "use the funds one of the largest amounts of funding for any field service provider, securing $66 million in July 2013 from Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) to expand sales and marketing capabilities, expand its geographic support and continue developing new functionality to address additional service models."
TOA was named one of America's Most Promising Companies in 2013 by Forbes magazine.
In July 2013, TOA closed a major round of funding with Technology Crossover Ventures, raising $66 million to transform global field service management.

Alexander Mohr

Alexander Mohr (1892–1974) was a German Expressionist artist.
Life and work.
Alexander Mohr was born in Frankenberg, Germany, to affluent parents who hailed from an aristocratic background. Mohr commenced his formal artistic instruction in 1905 in Koblenz, Germany under the tutelage of German expressionist William Straube (1871–1954), who was a student of Henri Matisse. His formal training was interrupted by World War I where he served as a Calvary Officer from 1914 to 1918 in the war's eastern front.
The war behind him, in 1919 Mohr studied under expressionist Adolf Holzel (1853–1934) in Stuttgart and executed his works in the circle of the Rhenish Expressionists in Düsseldorf.
In 1919 he illustrated a book for famed German expressionist writer Carl Maria Weber and later rendered avant-garde illustrations for other publications. Commencing in 1920 Mohr began a lifelong friendship with the French-German writer Joseph Breitbach (1903–1980).
In 1922 Mohr participated in the First International Art Exhibition in Düsseldorf. Later that year Mohr transitioned to Berlin where he became a member of the expressionist November Group and developed an acquaintance with art-handlers Alfred Flechtheim and Wilhelm Uhde.
From 1925 to 1931 Mohr both studied and worked in Paris with three one-man exhibitions in 1927, 1929 and 1930. Through his acquaintance with expressionist Max Jacob, Mohr gained access to Pablo Picasso, with further references from his author friend Joseph Breitbach. While in Paris, Mohr was comfortable and frequently seen with the bon vivant literary elite of Paris, including Jean Schlumberger, André Gide and Julien Green.
Many believe that Mohr's finest expressionist paintings were executed during his Paris years and represented bucolic, mythological scenes influenced by the writings of Virgil, Horace and Ovid as the three canonical poets of Latin literature.
On occasion during 1925 to 1930 Mohr journeyed to Hungary, Spain, Italy and Switzerland to advance his expressionist agenda. In 1932 Mohr visited Greece where he met and married Elsa Kahn, who would remain his lifelong partner. (Elsa's uncle was investment banker Otto Kahn (1867–1934) who built a 127-room mansion on Long Island, the second largest private residence in the U.S., after George Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina.)
For the next decade Mohr worked mostly in Germany, favoring his family homes in Trier and also Merzig, but also with frequent stays in Paris and Greece, inclusive of exhibitions in both Germany and Greece. His last one-man exhibition in Paris was in 1939 as the rumblings of World War II became louder. Mohr recognized the signs of conflict and opted to reside in Greece from 1942 to 1949.
From the mid-1930s Mohr's artistic style migrated from expressionism to a more abstract form of the German expressionist movement, albeit some characterize this period as a transition to cubism by Mohr. While both expressionism and cubism are forms of modern art, cubism is based much less on the expression of emotion than it is on an intellectual experiment with structure and few would argue that emotion is lacking in Mohr's works. His paintings exude expressive emotion and are executed with quintessential German exactitude. Mohr was a wizard in catching an expression as elusive as thought. A master of expressionist painting, Mohr latched on to the brash and angular. We can only imagine Mohr propped on his studio stool, well-groomed yet smug as he lays evanescent highlights onto the impastic background of the canvas of his early expressionistic work and on another occasion wondering if we will identify the blended nuances, all but hidden, in his later abstract expressionist works.
From 1950 to 1953 Mohr once again migrated to Paris and worked from a studio provided by the Schlumberger family and remained in close contact with his friend Joseph Breitbach.
Beginning in the mid-1950s Mohr resumed his peripatetic travel rhythm and his lifelong expressionist painting passion became a more casual endeavor. On February 8, 1974 expressionist painter Alexander Mohr succumbed to death after a short illness in Athens, Greece and was interred there as well.
Several retrospective exhibitions of the work of Alexander Mohr were held in decades following his demise. His life is described in "Alexander Mohr–Der Maler mit den Flügelschuhen" a 410 page illustrated monograph written by Christl Lehnert-Leven and published in 1996 in Germany.
While Mohr's exhibition listing is extensive, the artist neither sought nor received much notoriety outside his native Germany and his adopted Greece.

Pokój () is a village in Namysłów County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Pokój. It lies approximately south-east of Namysłów and north of the regional capital Opole.
It was established in 1748 as a hunting lodge by Duke Charles Christian Erdmann, a scion of the House of Württemberg, whose ancestors had been enfeoffed with the Silesian Duchy of Oels in 1649. The adjacent settlement erected from 1763 with its streets radiating out from the ducal palace was modeled on and named after the Baden residence of Karlsruhe. When the Oels fiefdom fell to the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1792, Charles Christian Erdmann's cousin Duke Eugen of Württemberg retained the town and palace of Carlsruhe as a fee tail. In the winter of 1806-07 he hosted the young composer Carl Maria von Weber, who wrote his two symphonies (Jähns 50/51) here. In 1847 Carlsruhe received the status of a spa town ("Bad").
In 1871 Carlsruhe together with the Prussian Province of Silesia was incorporated into the German Empire. By the 1945 Potsdam Agreement the area fell to Poland (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").
At the end of World War II the palace was destroyed in the course of the Vistula–Oder Offensive of the Red Army. The Baroque Sophia's Church finished in 1775 is preserved, as is the extended English garden laid out by the Württemberg dukes. An annual Carl Maria von Weber festival is held to commemorate the composer's stay.
Pokój's coat of arms shows the Württemberg three black antlers on the right, and the Upper Silesian eagle of the Dukes of Opole on the left side.

Venues of the 2010 Winter Olympics

For the 2010 Winter Olympics, a total of ten sports venues were used, seven in Vancouver (including BC Place), and three in Whistler.
The 2010 Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games were held in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The Olympics ran from February 12 to February 28, 2010, and the Paralympics from March 12 to March 21, during which nine competition venues were used, spread across Vancouver, Whistler, and the neighbouring areas of West Vancouver and Richmond. The majority of ice sport events were held in Vancouver, while Whistler, which normally serves as a ski resort, hosted the snow events. Six non-competition venues, three each in Vancouver and Whistler, provided athlete housing, space for media, and locations for ceremonies associated with the Games.
In its 2002 evaluation of Vancouver's bid during the bidding process for the 2010 Games, the Evaluation Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) highlighted the number and quality of existing competition and training facilities as one of the bid's strengths. Of the competition venues that the bid proposed for use during the Games, six required new construction, with the remainder already built in Vancouver and Whistler. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (VANOC), which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of facilities for the Games, pledged that all new construction of permanent facilities, whether on public or private land, would be funded by the government. 
According to CEO John Furlong, VANOC "started our venue construction as early as possible". Construction on Cypress Mountain, the first new competition venue to be completed, began in March 2006 and was completed only eight months later, three years ahead of the start of the Games. By December 2007, all three competition venues at Whistler were completed and open for training and testing. Final construction was completed in February 2009, and sporting events were scheduled at the venues to ensure that they would be adequately tested before hosting the Olympic events. In total, six new competition venues were constructed: Cypress Mountain, Richmond Olympic Oval, UBC Thunderbird Arena, Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre, Whistler Olympic Park, and The Whistler Sliding Centre.
The Whistler Sliding Centre was promoted as being one of the fastest sliding tracks in the world, which caused a number of concerns about safety. On February 12, 2010, hours before the opening ceremony, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili suffered a fatal crash during a training run when he was thrown off his sled and collided with a steel pole. He was travelling at the time. His accident came after a series of incidents in the week and reignited concerns about the track's safety. Investigations were conducted the same day, concluding that the accident was not caused by deficiencies in the track. As a preventative measure, an extra of wall was added after the end of Turn 16, and the ice profile was changed.
Competition venues.
The largest competition venue was Canada Hockey Place, with a capacity of just under 19,000 spectators. For the first time, Olympic games were played on a narrower NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 61 metres × 26 metres (200 ft × 85 ft), instead of the international size of 61 m × 30 m (200 ft × 98.5 ft). This change saved an expected $10 million (CAD) in construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games. This arena, as well as the second-largest venue of Vancouver 2010, Pacific Coliseum, were pre-existing and required minimal renovation in preparation for the Olympics. Of the newly constructed venues for the Games, the Whistler Sliding Centre was the largest, with space for 12,000 spectators to observe the luge, skeleton and bobsled events. Three venues used in the Games were outside Vancouver and Whistler: Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, the Richmond Olympic Oval in Richmond, and UBC Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre on the University Endowment Lands.
Non-competition venues.
Because of the significant distance between Vancouver and Whistler, Olympic Villages and media facilities were constructed in both locations. In addition, while medals ceremonies for the events held in Vancouver took place at the pre-existing BC Place Stadium, an additional venue was constructed in Whistler to award medals there. BC Place is an indoor stadium, so the Olympic torch cauldron, which was lit in the middle of the stadium during the opening ceremony, could not be left there because of safety concerns. A second "external cauldron" was erected on the Coal Harbour waterfront, next to the Main Media Centre.
Notes.
1. Canada Hockey Place was normally known as General Motors Place at the time of the Olympics, but because corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue, it was renamed for the duration of the games.

Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse

Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse is a book, issued in 1800, that gives an account of the 1791-1793 d'Entrecasteaux expedition to Australasia. The title refers to the search for La Pérouse, who disappeared in the region in 1788, a popular, though unsuccessful, object of the mission. Many of the discoveries made by the scientists attached to the expedition were published in the two volumes. The author, Jacques Labillardière, was a French botanist on the voyage, engaged to collect and describe the flora of the continent. The work includes some of the earliest descriptions of Australian flora and fauna, and an account of the indigenous peoples of Tasmania.
The work also contains the second ever description of an Australian spider, the species "Nephila edulis". Labillardière also describes seeing a dog-sized animal, and discovering the remains of a carnivorous animal, what is considered to be the first European report of a thylacine. The author of the first description, George Harris, cites this work in an 1804 letter regarding rumours of such an animal.
Labillardière's work was published in two volumes, becoming very popular and translated into English in the same year; Voyage in search of La Pérouse (four editions) was issued by John Stockdale with similar success. The contents include his description of the journey, an atlas, and illustrations of ethnographic and natural history subjects. The work is noted for its early botanical illustrations of Redouté, birds by Jean-Baptiste Audebert, and engravings produced from the surviving illustrations of Piron.
The first description of a West Australian eucalypt, "Eucalyptus cornuta", and the widely cultivated "Eucalyptus globulus" are amongst the newly discovered species and genera of flora. Those discovered while anchored at Observatory Island, Esperance Bay, include "Banksia nivea", "Banksia repens", "Anigozanthus rufus" and "Chorizema ilicifolia".
The botanical descriptions were based on the extensive collections made by Labillardière during the expedition's stop at Esperance Bay, and the two visits to Tasmania. The abbreviation Voy.Rech.Perouse is used to refer to this work in botanical literature.
The book was published during a time of great interest in the flora of Australia. It was preceded by A specimen of the botany of New Holland (1793–1795), the first book devoted to the subject. 
The botanist Robert Brown took a copy of this work on his journey to Australia in 1801, enquiring in his letters home as to whether Labillardière had published his flora. This anticipated work, Labillardière's "Novae Hollandiae plantarum specimen" (1804–1806), was published before Brown's more comprehensive Prodromus.
This work preceded Rossel's English publication of the d’Entrecasteaux journal, Voyage de d’Entrecasteaux envoyage à la recherche de La Pérouse, by nine years.

Florida State Road 574

State Road 574 (SR 574) is an east–west state highway in Central Hillsborough County, Florida. It runs from northwestern Tampa to Plant City, and parallels County Road 574 west of Mango.
Route description.
Beginning at the intersection of U.S. Route 92 (Dale Mabry Highway) on the north side of Raymond James Stadium and the site of the former Tampa Stadium as Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard(formerly Buffalo Avenue), SR 574 is a six-lane divided highway until it passes the home office of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and narrows down to a four-lane divided highway. Instantly, the road is surrounded by the Tampa Branch of St. Joseph's Hospital. The road remains a four-lane divided highway until it reaches Armenia Avenue and becomes a four-lane undivided highway with occasional left-turn lanes. The road crosses the Hillsborough River over a high bridge built in 1960.
The intersection of southbound US Business Route 41 moves from Highland Avenue to Tampa Avenue when it crosses SR 574, and the road gets a divider again. Northbound US BUS 41 stays consistently on Florida Avenue. The next two major crossings are a diamond interchange with Interstate 275 and then State Road 45(Nebraska Avenue). East of here, the road consists of residences, local businesses and churches, and most notably the headquarters of radio station WMNF 88.5 FM. The intersection of State Road 585(22nd Street) includes the Cyrus Green Playground on the southwest corner and College Hill Memorial Park on the southeast corner. A railroad crossing exists between Short 30th Street and 30th Street, and another one two blocks west of US 41(40th Street). East of US 41, the road narrows down to two lanes, and two blocks later at 42nd Street, the road runs between the Garden of Memories Cemetery and Myrtle Hill Cemetery. The southern boundaries of both cemeteries include East Lake Avenue, since SR 574 crosses that street before the intersection with State Road 583(50th Street).
When SR 574 enters Grant Park, it widens back to four lanes in the vicinity of the diamond interchange with Interstate 4, and then widens to six-lanes. East of here, the Florida State Fairgrounds and a gas station can be found on the northwest corner of US 301 in Mango. After this, the road crosses over the Tampa Bypass Canal before reaching a third interchange and narrowing down to four lanes, this time with Interstate 75 as a diamond interchange southbound and a partial cloverleaf interchange northbound. After this, the road widens back to six lanes and encounters its Hillsborough County doppelganger at Broadway Avenue(CR 574) then Lemon Street and Mango Road, one of three disconnected roads in Hillsborough County that have been designated County Road 579. From there, the road narrows back down to two lanes. Before the road intersects Kingsway Avenue in Seffner, it moves slightly to the northeast, where it runs parallel to Amtrak's Silver Star line, as it also does in Dover. Throughout this section, there are scattered private railroad crossings that intersect with SR 574.
In Plant City, SR 574 becomes Sammonds Road, then SR 574 moves onto West Reynolds Street at a sharp reverse curve However neither of these names appear on street-name signs until the route moves off of Sammonds Road. When SR 574 returns eastward it runs along the south side of the ground of the Florida Strawberry Festival. After crossing unmarked State Road 39A, the western truck route for State Road 39, SR 574 intersects with SR 566, which is part of an eastbound only segment of U.S. Route 92. Route 574 joins eastbound US 92 as a shared hidden route with SR 600, all of which enter part of the Downtown Plant City Historic Residential District at Carey Street, and leaves it at Franklin Street. Northbound State Road 39 begins at North Wheeler Street, while entering the Downtown Plant City Commercial District, as Southbound SR 39 joins eastbound US 92/SR 574 just before intersected at North Collins Street and turns south while eastbound US 92/SR 574 becomes East Reynolds Street. SR 574 finally terminates at the intersection of East Reynolds Street, East Baker Street, and North Gordon Street, where the eastbound and westbound(E. Baker St) segments of U.S. Route 92 reunite. County Road 574 and it various suffixed alternates continue into Polk County.

Museo Mitre

The Museo Mitre (Spanish) (Mitre Museum) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is a museum dedicated to Argentine history, as well as to the legacy of President Bartolomé Mitre.
Overview.
Dating from 1785, the Spanish colonial home's first link to Argentine history was as the refuge sought by the last Viceroy of Río de la Plata, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, following the May Revolution of 1810. The home rented by General Bartolomé Mitre in 1860, and remained his residence during his tenure as the 6th President of Argentina, between 1862 and 1868; in recognition of his term as President, as well as for his contributions to national unity, a group of local citizens purchased the home in his name in 1868, and the statesman lived there until his death in 1906. "La Nación", one of the nation's oldest and most influential dailies, was published here from its establishment in 1870, until 1895. 
The home was purchased by the National Government via Law 4.943, in June of that year, and on June 3, 1907, the Mitre Museum opened its doors to the public. The museum's first director, Alejandro Rosa, had founded the Western Hemisphere Historic and Numismatic Society with Mitre in 1893, and following the classification of Mitre's extensive ethnolinguistic library, numismatic and other collections, the society was located in the museum from 1918 until 1971 (it was rechartered as the National Academy of History of Argentina in 1938).
The museum was declared a National Historic Monument on May 21, 1942, and is maintained by the National Secretariat of Culture. The museum can be seen on some Argentinian two peso bills.

Rosyth – Zeebrugge ferry service

The ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge is a freight-only service operated by DFDS. The current service replaces a passenger and freight service that was operated by Norfolkline from 18 May 2009 until 15 December 2010 (and initially operated by Superfast Ferries between May 2002 and September 2008). It is the only direct ferry route between Scotland and Continental Europe. On 20 August 2010 it was announced that the passenger service would end on 15 December 2010, although the freight-only service resumed shortly thereafter.
Route.
The route crosses the North Sea between Rosyth, Fife, Scotland and Zeebrugge, Flanders, Belgium. Near Rosyth, the ferry passes under the Forth Bridge.
Superfast Ferries.
Following a detailed consultation and tendering process by the Scottish Executive, the Greek shipping company Superfast Ferries (owned by the Attica Group) were confirmed as the operator of the route. Services commenced in May 2002 using two ships - "MS Superfast IX" and "MS Superfast X" - to provide an overnight service with a crossing time of 17 hours.
Whilst car traffic, particularly in the summer months, proved relatively good, concern mounted that there were insufficient lorries and other freight traffic to make the service viable in the long term. The service was reduced to three times per week in 2005 and Superfast IX transferred to the Baltic Sea.
In 2006, the sale of "Superfast X" was announced and the vessel was replaced with the smaller "Blue Star I" - of Superfast's sister company Blue Star Ferries (also owned by Attica). In 2008 it was announced that Superfast/Blue Star Ferries would discontinue the service in September.
Norfolkline.
The decision to axe the route caused considerable political disquiet in Scotland. The Scottish Government sought to encourage a new operator to take over the route. In late 2008 Norfolkline announced that it would restart the route in May 2009, again using a thrice-weekly overnight service (but extended to 20 hours, rather than the previous 17 hours, to reduce fuel consumption).
Like Superfast, the Norfolkline service offered a service for both vehicle and foot passengers.
Norfolkline is a Netherlands-based a subsidiary of the Danish shipping company DFDS and formerly of the Maersk Group. On 17 December 2009 DFDS announced that it had agreed to purchase Norfolkline from Maersk.
Norfolkline's vessel for the route was the "MV Scottish Viking" (which, despite the name, is registered in Italy.)
DFDS Seaways.
On 20 August 2010 DFDS announced that the passenger service would end on 15 December 2010, with the service being replaced by a DFDS Seaways freight-only ferry service. The replacement freight-only service was operated with two ferries the Tor Finlandia and the Cimbria Seaways with 4 departures per week. In April 2011, this was reduced to one DFDS Seaways freight-only ferry operating three departures per week.
Unless another operator recommences operations, there will again be no direct passenger ferry service between Scotland and continental Europe.

Olav Larssen

Olav Larssen (10 July 1894 – 5 July 1981) was a Norwegian newspaper editor and politician for the Labour and Communist parties.
Personal life.
Olav Larssen was born in Furnes as a son of baker Kristian Larssen and Lovise Wahlum (1873–1923). He attended primary school in rural Furnes, but then moved to the nearby city Hamar to take apprenticeship as a typographer. By 1910 he dwelled as a tenant in "Østregate 55" in the neighborhood Østbyen, nearby Hamar Station. He recalled having to adapt to the city culture, and shed some of his childhood dialect/sociolect.
In 1917 he married taylor's daughter Aslaug Rustad (1892–1987). She hailed from Hamar and was the oldest girl of ten siblings. After her mother's death when she was fourteen, she had to abandon plans to become a hairdresser to help her father with tending to their family.
Their daughter Randi (1924–2002) was a well-known journalist and writer. From April 1946 she was married to Prime Minister of Norway (1971–72 and 1973–76) Trygve Bratteli. Their son Erik (1921–) became a state secretary and also a permanent under-secretary of state () in the Ministry of Transport. He changed his last name to Ribu, and was married to a daughter of editor Jørgen Hustad.
Career.
Hamar and Drammen.
Olav Larssen was involved in the temperance movement at a young age. He had a family background of interest in politics, as his father was a member of Furnes municipal council for the Liberal Party. Later, in 1915, the liberal workers' union under the chairmanship of Kristian Larssen decided to take up collective membership in the Labour Party. Olav Larssen became active in the youth wing of the Labour Party, Norges Socialdemokratiske Ungdomsforbund (NSU), already in 1911 when a local NSU branch was founded in Hamar.
At that time, Larssen underwent the typographer's apprenticeship in the book printer . He had nearly completed his training when being hired as sub-editor in the Labour Party newspaper "Demokraten" in June 1913. Hitherto, his experience with journalism had been limited to writing pieces in the youth wing's national newspaper "Klassekampen" from time to time, a task associated with his active political role. However, he had also involved himself in a debate on the editor of "Demokraten", which incidentally was printed by .'s supervisory council on 16 June 1913, Larssen was elected to become sub-editor under Monsen. The vote margin was 14–13, with Larssen edging out experienced "Solungen" editor Waldemar Carlsen.-->
Larssen had recently become secretary in the board of the newly established county branch of NSU. He was later chosen as one of the secretaries at the NSU national convention in Hamar in 1914.
On the tenure in "Demokraten", Larsen wrote that "they were not relieved from the eternal financial torment". He resigned from the newspaper in 1916. Newly engaged to Aslaug Rustad, Larssen was hired in the Drammen-based newspaper "Fremtiden" in October 1916. After some introductory weeks, he was hired as manager of the newspaper's local office in Kongsberg. He returned to the "Fremtiden" head office in Drammen in the autumn of 1918. He bought a city house in Strømsø together with colleague Olaf Solumsmoen.
Editor-in-chief.
He edited the Labour Party newspapers "Demokraten" from 1920 to 1927, and "Hamar Arbeiderblad" from 1927 to 1935. In 1935 he was hired as a journalist in "Arbeiderbladet". In 1940, when Norway became invaded and occupied by Germany, Larssen was the acting news editor of "Arbeiderbladet" before it was stopped by the Germans. He co-edited the illegal "Bulletinen" from 1940 to 1942, but for this he was imprisoned. He was held at Møllergata 19 from January to April 1942, then at Grini until February 1943, and thereafter in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp until the war ended. From this period he wrote the section "Blant landsmenn i Sachsenhausen" ('Among fellow countrymen in Sachsenhausen') in the memoir book "3 fra Sachsenhausen" (together with August Lange, Carl Johan Frederik Jakhelln and W. Winiarski).
Following the liberation of Norway in 1945, Larssen again became the news editor of "Arbeiderbladet". He was editor-in-chief from 1949 to 1963.

Musica Humana Research

Musica Humana Research is a collaboration between art, music and medical research 
The idea behind this project was the creation of a specially composed and designed music for treatment of hospitalized patients and was initiated by Professor M.D. Lars Heslet Copenhagen University Hospital and the composer and oboist Niels Eje during the nineties. 
In 1998 the Egmont Foundation granted economic support to complete the project.
The Egmont Foundation grant (1998–2003) was primarily aimed at developing a special composed music programme targeted at improving the sound environment in intensive care and recovery wards at a number of hospitals in Denmark. 
This specially designed music was to be created by composer Niels Eje and according to the grant foundation, implemented and scientifically validated by a group of researchers affiliated to the project. 
The goal was to actively use specially designed music to improve patient wellbeing and satisfaction during hospitalisation, reduce anxiety and stress, and also improve the patients ability to recover.
Since 2001 Musica Humana Research has carried out many activities, including publishing and drawing attention to the research results and how to improve the sound environment for patients in hospitals. The activities includes articles in medical journals, presentations at conferences and symposiums all over the world.
Musica Humana Research has since 2003 become an international network of independent researchers, achieving positive and documented results with clinical trials in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and United States.

Jacob Vidnes

Jacob Laurentius Vidnes (5 November 1875 – 4 October 1940) was a Norwegian trade unionist, newspaper editor, politician for the Labour Party and civil servant.
He was born in Vanylven as a son of farmer Knud Larsen Vidnes (1819–98) og Laurine Knudsdatter (1832–1910). In May 1929 he married hotelier's daughter Sigrid Birkeland (1900–1989), who after the death of Vidnes married Arne Ording.
He graduated from Volda Teachers' College in 1896, moved to Oslo as subeditor of "Arbeideren" in 1898 and was hired in the Labour Party main newspaper "Social-Demokraten" in 1899. In 1900 he was a co-founder and first chairman of "Kristiania socialdemokratiske Ungdomslag". He was then one of the founders of Norges Socialdemokratiske Ungdomsforbund in 1903.
In 1909 he founded the trade union Norges Socialdemokratiske Presseforening, for all employees in the social democratic press. He was also a board member of the Norwegian Press Association. He had advanced to subeditor, and was from 1912 to 1918 the editor-in-chief of "Social-Demokraten". He represented the Labour Party in Kristiania city council from 1914 to 1919, and was a member of its central board from 1912. From 1913 to 1918 he was also a member of the International Socialist Bureau.
In 1918 the radical wing of the Labour Party assumed control of the party at the national convention. Vidnes stepped down from the central committee, and from the positions as chairman of Socialdemokratiske Presseforening and chief editor of "Social-Demokraten". In a piece called "Arbeiderpartiet gaar helt over til bolsjevismen" published in the right-wing newspaper "Tidens Tegn" in May 1919 he denounced the "Bolshevism" in the Labour Party.
In 1919 he was chosen by the Norwegian government as advisor at a League of Nations conference. The next year he was hired as head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs press office. After the German invasion of Norway in 1940, he fled together with the government and royal family to London. Here, he was appointed editor of "Norsk Tidend", the organ of the Norwegian cabinet-in-exile. He died in October 1940, after supervising only two issues.

Hayes Mission School

Hayes Mission School is a co-educational Protestant school located in the Bomi County section of Zohn and Gowein Township in the West African nation of Liberia. The school was founded in 1968 by the Rev. McCarthy and Missionary Hayes through the support of the United Holy Church of America, and has 450 students in Kindergarten through sixth grade. Hayes Mission school was created under the direction of the late Bishop J.T. Bowens, prelate of UHCA, Inc., and is named in honor of its founders/missionaries, McCarthy and Lois Hayes. The Superintendent of the school is Mr. Johnathan Ernest.
History.
Established in September 1968, the school's first graduating class was in 1971, and its first Principal was Fr. McCarthy Hayes, of the UHCA, Inc. There were 9 students in that class. Classes were first held in the all-purpose building. School Hall, the first school building, opened in 1973, and consisted of four classrooms and a small library. The first expansion included the western wing of School Hall in 1974–77. The library was constructed in 1979–80 and the former library was converted into kindergarten classrooms. The enrollment ranged between 100 to 150 students for many years.
A football field was constructed in 1980 and dedicated by Bishop Hayes. Dormitories were added to accommodate the expanding number of students. The church, Upper Room Tabernacle, was reconstructed and rededicated in 2007.
There is an airfield and a hangar to house aircraft on campus. The school attracts students from all over the Monrovia and Bomi areas and has become competitive in its admissions process. As of the 2008–09 school year, the school had an enrollment of 150 students and 9.0 classroom teachers on an equivalent|FTE basis, for a student-teacher ratio of 4.4.

Edie later goes to visit the priest and wants to know more about his past, but the priest tells her she should be talking to her husband. Unintentionally, he says goodbye by calling her Mrs. Dash and when she corrects him by saying it is "Williams" the priest apologizes because he forgets she might not take her husband's name. Edie starts searching by entering "David Dash" into an internet search engine.

St. Boniface General Hospital (Winnipeg)

St. Boniface General Hospital (also called St. Boniface Hospital or St. B) is Manitoba's second-largest hospital, located in the St. Boniface neighbourhood of Winnipeg. It was founded by the Sisters of Charity (Grey Nuns) of Montreal in 1871, and was the first hospital in Western Canada. The hospital was incorporated in 1960, and as of 2003 has 554 beds and 78 bassinets.
St. Boniface Hospital is a tertiary health care facility, employing nearly 700 doctors and around 1,500 nurses. The hospital buildings cover about . The St. Boniface Hospital & Research Foundation is the primary fundraising organization for the hospital. The general admissions program cares for 4,000 patients per year in-hospital, and about 40,000 as outpatients. Over 5,000 births per year occur at the hospital. St. Boniface is a regional centre for cardiac care, and is one of two specialized laboratory testing facilities. It also provides diagnostic imaging and hemodialysis for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.
Besides patient care, St. Boniface Hospital also carries out medical research and offers practicum positions for university students through its affiliation with the University of Manitoba. The hospital's primary research mandate is in cardiovascular studies, imaging (especially MRI), neurodegenerative disorders, and nutraceuticals. The hospital also participates in clinical trials of research discoveries.
Location.
St Boniface General Hospital is located between the Red and Assiniboine Rivers in the St. Boniface neighbourhood of Winnipeg, which is home to a large proportion of Manitoba's Francophone population. It lies across the river from downtown and The Forks. The hospital has a parking structure and three parking lots. It also has an ambulance bay.
History.
St. Boniface Hospital was established by the Grey Nuns in 1871, the first hospital west of Quebec. At that time, it was a small facility with four beds. An operating room was added in 1894. The Grey Nuns opened a school of nursing in 1897 and used the hospital to teach patient care. By the early 1900s, the hospital was treating approximately 2,500 patients per year. An isolation hospital and nurse's residence was added in 1900. Due to overcrowding, a new addition was built in 1905, effectively doubling the patient capacity of the hospital. It was awarded provisional approval by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in 1944, later becoming the office of the Manitoba Chapter of the ACS. As of 2003, the hospital has 554 beds and 78 bassinets.
The hospital order was incorporated in 1960 under the name St. Boniface General Hospital, giving it the right to invest and borrow money, own property, and collect fees for services. St. Boniface Hospital, along with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, opened the first hospice programs in Canada in 1975. The Hospital Research Centre opened in 1987, becoming the first Canadian free-standing medical research facility. During the 1997 Red River Flood, the hospital had to be evacuated, and has since created a disaster plan to cope any future evacuations or closures.
The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St Boniface Hospital.
Funding.
Basic medical care is a benefit provided to all Canadians through Canada's publicly funded health system. However, significant additional funding is required for medical research, improvements in patient services, and the clinical programs found at St. Boniface Hospital. The hospital ended the 2008 fiscal year with a C$900,000 deficit. The St. Boniface Hospital & Research Foundation, founded in 1971, is the primary fundraising organization for St. Boniface Hospital and the Research Centre. By the end of 2006, the Foundation had raised over C$100 million for patient care and research.
Research.
The St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre is the hospital's main research facility. It comprises three separate units: the G. Campbell MacLean Building, the Dr. Andrei Sakharov MRI Centre, and the I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute, which are operated with research grants, industry contracts, fundraising, and funding from the University of Manitoba. The centre opened in 1987. Its primary research mandate addresses three main areas: cardiovascular sciences, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy, and degenerative disorders associated with aging. In addition, the Centre undertakes research in anesthesia, epidemiology, family medicine, infectious diseases, nephrology, nursing, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, sleep disorders, and surgery.
Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences.
St. Boniface Hospital's Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences researches heart disease at the cellular and molecular levels. It also hosts the "Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology", the journal "Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry", the International Academy of Cardiovascular Sciences, and its journal "Experimental & Clinical Cardiology". The Institute was created as the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences in 1987 by Dr. Naranjan Dhalla. Its researchers have been published in such academic journals as the "New England Journal of Medicine" and "Cardiovascular Research".
Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders.
The Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders (DND) was established in 1999. The DND is a neurodegenerative research team working to identify causes and treatments for disorders like Alzheimer’s, strokes, traumatic brain injury, and central nervous system degeneration, to study the effect of diabetes on neurodegeneration, and to conduct sleep studies. As of 2011, the principal investigators collectively have over 150 journal publications.
Canadian Centre for Agri-Food Research in Health and Medicine.
The Canadian Centre for Agri-food Research in Health and Medicine (CCARM) investigates nutraceuticals and health food in partnership with Agriculture and Agri-food Canada. CCARM’s mandate is to research natural health products and give the results to the scientific community and the general public. The results of their research have been published in numerous academic journals, including the "European Journal of Clinical Nutrition" and the "Journal of Biological Chemistry".
MRI centre.
The Dr. Andrei Sakharov Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Facility, the first of its kind in Manitoba, has three MRI scanners. The facility allows radiologists to diagnose abnormalities of the brain, spinal cord, internal organs and joints. St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre is a recognized leader in the MRI field and has one of the largest MRI research facilities in Canada. An MRI was first installed at St. Boniface in 1990; this MRI was eventually replaced by a more modern version, which is primarily used for clinical purposes. The other two MRIs are research-oriented: they are an interventional scanner and a head-only functional unit. The clinical scanner enables the Centre to do echo-planar imaging, producing images at video rates; the interventional MRI gives physicians access to the patient during imaging, which supports research into robotics-guided laser surgery. Research carried out at the centre has been published in the "Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging".
Clinical research.
The I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute facilitates clinical trials of the discoveries made at the Research Centre. The Institute is the third research facility in Canada to conduct tests on new drugs and medical devices. The I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute was opened in 2004.
Education.
St. Boniface Hospital is affiliated with the University of Manitoba's education and research branches, providing internship and practicum positions for students. The hospital works with multiple University of Manitoba faculties, including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social work, respiratory therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, as well as with Red River College and Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. St. Boniface Hospital also hosts the Winnipeg Critical Care Nursing Education Program.
Services.
St. Boniface is one of Manitoba's two tertiary care centres. Patients are usually referred to the hospital by their doctors or clinics for specialized care, but may also be admitted through the emergency department. The Medicine Program is the adult general admissions program. This program admits around 4,000 patients per year, and treats around 40,000 through outpatient clinics. Services include: internal medicine, endocrinology, rheumatology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, hematology, oncology, pathology and neurology. The outreach program also includes at-home intravenous therapy and nutrition. The hospital has 14 operating rooms; there is also a surgical intensive care unit available for recovery. The surgical department treats over 14,000 patients per year. St. Boniface's emergency department provides acute care for an average of over 100 patients per day. The emergency room has recently been renovated, and the department is currently working to reduce patient wait times.
The Family Medicine Program is designed to encourage disease prevention and health maintenance. It also includes a palliative care unit, the first nationally accredited palliative residency program in Canada. The Rehabilitation Program provides inpatient and outpatient physiotherapy. The Mental Health program provides psychological and counselling services to adult and adolescent patients. It also maintains an inpatient program, and provides stress counselling to hospital staff.
Cardiac Sciences Program.
The Cardiac Sciences Program (including the departments of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiology, Cardiac Anesthesiology and Critical Care) is an integrated heart health unit designed to treat cardiac problems. The Bergen Cardiac Care Centre provides access to tertiary cardiology care and hosts cardiac operations and diagnostics, the only hospital in Manitoba to offer certain specialized services. It includes three cardiac angiography rooms, one pacemaker and cardiac defibrillator room, one room for procedures in electrophysiology, 17 recovery beds, cardiology clinics, echocardiography rooms, and office space.
Diagnostic imaging.
St. Boniface is one of eight hospitals in Winnipeg providing diagnostic imaging services, and is part of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's diagnostic imaging program. It provides: angiography, bone density imaging, CT scans, MRIs, mammography, nuclear medicine tests, ultrasounds and X-rays. St. Boniface was the home of Manitoba's first MRI scanner, and is one of the largest diagnostic MRI facilities in Western Canada.
Laboratories.
The laboratories at the St. Boniface Hospital operate under the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's Laboratory Medicine Program; St. Boniface is one of the two main referral sites in the WRHA for specialty tests. They run tests in biochemistry, hematology, immunology, microbiology, cytology and pathology for patients and doctors in Manitoba. They also provide some specialized testing facilities for educational institutions.
Manitoba Renal Program.
St. Boniface Hospital provides acute and chronic hemodialysis as part of the Manitoba Renal Program. It also has a renal health clinic to assess patients with kidney problems.
Woman & Child Program.
The Woman & Child Program cares for 11,500 patients annually, providing gynecological and obstetrical services, outpatient pediatric care and women's services. Over 5,000 births per year occur at St. Boniface Hospital. The Labour and Delivery department includes services for high-risk deliveries. The family care unit includes fifteen beds for obstetrical patients. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) cares for 600 premature or ill infants per year; 10% of the births at St. Boniface involve ill or premature babies.
Assessment.
St. Boniface reports 80% patient satisfaction with its services, according to internal inpatient surveys. Mortality rates for inpatients stand at around 2.4%. Unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada does not publish national ratings of individual hospitals.
According to internal reviews, the hospital reduced average wait times for acute care surgical patients from 10 hours to 3 between October 2008 and February 2009. As of 2009, the hospital is trying to reduce wait times for emergency room patients. Wait times for scheduled diagnostic services range from 4 weeks for bone density tests to 20 weeks for a myocardial perfusion study. The median wait time for cardiac surgery is 26 days.

Dąbrowice , German Dombrowitz is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Chrząstowice (Gemeinde Chronstau), within Opole County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It lies approximately south of Chrząstowice (Chronstau) and east of the regional capital Opole. Since 2006 it has been officially bilingual in German and Polish
Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see "Territorial changes of Poland after World War II").
History.
The town of Dombrowitz was first mentioned in 1297. In 1526 the area came under the control of the Hapsburg Empire. In 1566 the name was recorded as "Dumbrowicz". After the War of the Austrian Succession, Silesia was taken by the Kingdom of Prussia. After the unification of Germany, the village was located in the Upper Silesia Province.
In the Upper Silesia plebiscite on March 20, 1921, 134 people voted to remain in Germany and 45 to join Poland. Consequently, Dombrowitz remained with Germany. In 1933 Dombrowitz had 233 inhabitants. Until 1945 it was located in the district of Landkreis Oppeln.
From 1935 the Nazi government made an large-scale effort to rename places with Slavic-origin names. On 15 June 1936 the town was renamed Eichgrund O.S. In 1939 the town had 294 inhabitants.
After 1945 the town was annexed to Poland and much of German population was expelled; it was renamed Dąbrowie to de-Germanize it, and later this name was changed to Dąbrowice. In 1950 the town was added to Opole Voivodeship and in 1999 Opole County (formerly Kreis Oppeln) was reconstituted. On 20 January 2006 the town was officially made bilingual in German and Polish, and in May its German name was made official alongside the Polish Dąbrowice.

The Lismullen Hurdle is a Grade 2 National Hunt hurdle race in Ireland which is open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Navan over a distance of about 2 miles and 4 furlongs (4,023 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in November.
The event was formerly restricted to amateur jockeys, and it used to be contested in mid December. For a period its distance was 2 miles and 5 furlongs. It ceased to be an amateur race in 1991, and at the same time it was cut by 2 furlongs. Its present length was introduced in 1992, and two years later it was given Grade 3 status and moved to early November. The race was promoted to Grade 2 level in 1997.

Harry Vestli

Harry August Vestli (10 May 1918 – 2 September 1942) was a Norwegian trade unionist who was imprisoned and died during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.
Harry Vestli was born in Sande i Vestfold as the son of Petter Rikard Vestli and his Swedish wife Emma Kristine. He had gone through middle school, and worked at the factory Lilleborg, where he was the union steward.
On 9 September 1941, the so-called milk strike occurred in Oslo. The Nazi German occupants of Norway ordered a harsh crackdown on the striking workers, and martial law was declared the next day. A local union leader, Rolf Wickstrøm, and chief jurist in the Confederation of Trade Unions, Viggo Hansteen were executed immediately. Arrested on 12 September, Harry Vestli was sentenced to death together with Ludvik Buland and Josef Larsson, but the three were later reprieved, and instead given a lifelong jail sentence. Vestli was imprisoned at both Grini and Akershus Fortress, before being sent to Germany on 16 October 1941. While imprisoned here he contracted tuberculosis. He died in September 1942 at a hospital in Hamburg.

LaVelle Smith Jnr

LaVelle Smith Jnr is an American choreographer. Known for his work in the music videos of singers such as En Vogue, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Beyoncé Knowles, Smith has won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography five times.
Biography.
Smith had originally wanted to pursue a career in drama, auditioning at the Youth Performing Arts School in Louisville, Kentucky. Upon failing the audition, Smith was given the option to study dance. Graduating from YPAS in 1983, Smith moved to Chicago and was employed by Gus Giordano in the dance troupe Giordano Jazz Dance Chicago. Unhappy with the level of pay, Smith auditioned for numerous dancing roles, whilst facing racial prejudice. "When that happens, you realize that you have to be even better or move to L.A. where it doesn't matter," he said later. 
Noticed by singer Michael Jackson, Smith landed a job as a dancer before becoming his choreographer. Smith worked on three of Jackson's world tours; Bad, Dangerous and HIStory. He also worked as a choreographer in Michael Jackson's Ghosts, and for the musical "Thriller - Live".
Smith appeared on the concert tours of The Rolling Stone's, Diana Ross and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour. Smith also worked for Victoria Beckham after the Spice Girl made a return as a solo artist.
Smith was awarded four MTV Video awards for co-choreographing En Vogue's music videos "My Lovin'" (1992), "Free Your Mind" (1993), "Whatta Man" (1994) and Michael Jackson's duet with sister Janet, "Scream" (1995). The music video for Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love" won Smith his fifth MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography in 2003.
His other awards include a SSDC Bob Fosse award and an Emmy award. Smith was also the youngest inductee into the Millers Gallery of Greats.
Personal life.
Moving from Los Angeles, California back to Louisville in 2001, the choreographer wanted to get away from the expensive party lifestyle of the city. 
In his leisure time, Smith enjoys inspiring others to pursue their dreams and holds a free dance class at the Home of the Innocents. The free entry is due to Smith recalling "being young and not being able to afford dance classes. I just want to inspire them. There are opportunities out there, and it may just be a sentence that you say that they latch on to and that sparks them."
