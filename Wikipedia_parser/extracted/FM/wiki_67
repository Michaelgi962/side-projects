2012 phenomenon

The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the Mayan civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala.
Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date, all unequivocally rejected by all scholarship. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum, an interaction between Earth and the black hole at the center of the galaxy, or Earth's collision with a planet called Nibiru.
Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional Mayanist scholars stated that no extant classic Maya accounts forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Maya history and culture, while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience, easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.
Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.
December 2012 marked the conclusion of a "b'ak'tun"—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900 AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.
Unlike the 260-day tzolk'in still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a "uinal", 18 uinals (360 days) made a "tun", 20 tuns made a "k'atun", and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a "b'ak'tun". Thus, the Mayan date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.
Apocalypse.
There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Mayan literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation. According to the "Popol Vuh", a compilation of the creation accounts of the K'iche' Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world. The "Popol Vuh" describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years. The Long Count's "zero date" was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Mayan date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya". In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in "The Maya" that "there is a suggestion ... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th Thus ... our present universe [would be annihilated December 2012 when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."
Objections.
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012", said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention." In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested". Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that Maya would think the world would come to an end" in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle", and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in". "There will be another cycle", said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue – that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."
Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end in the b'ak'tun 13. Ricardo Cajas, president of the Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala, said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the Procurador de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.
Prior associations.
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of Christopher Columbus, who was compiling a work called "Libro de las profecias" during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on Guanaja, an island off the north coast of Honduras. Influenced by the writings of Bishop Pierre d'Ailly, Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the Apocalypse. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the Spanish Conquest as the result of popular astrological predictions in Europe of a second Great Flood for the year 1524.
In the early 1900s, German scholar Ernst Förstemann interpreted the last page of the Dresden Codex as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event. His ideas were repeated by archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World ... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a Great Flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, "The Ancient Maya", the first edition of which was published in 1946.
Mayan references to b'ak'tun 13.
It is not certain what significance the classic Maya gave to the 13th b'ak'tun. Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations. Two items in the Mayan classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.
Tortuguero.
The Tortuguero site, which lies in southernmost Tabasco, Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:
Very little is known about the god Bolon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in "British Anthropological Reports", his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes. He also appears in inscriptions from Palenque, Usumacinta, and La Mar as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one stele he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.
Based on observations of modern Mayan rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site. They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century. Mayanist scholar Stephen Houston contests this view by arguing that future dates on Mayan inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.
La Corona.
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.
Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13.
Mayan inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year Calendar Round from the coronation of the ruler K'inich Janaab' Pakal. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615 AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, ) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it, arriving at a date of 21 October 4772 AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.
Another example is Stela 1 at Coba which marks the date of creation as , or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase. Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 2021×13×360 days, or roughly 2.687×1028 years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the age of the universe as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.
In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Mayan astronomical tables in Xultún, Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.
New Age beliefs.
Many assertions about the year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified collection of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from "Mayanist", used to refer to an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of "balancing the cosmos" was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon does not draw from those traditions. Instead, it is bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Established themes found in 2012 literature include "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature is not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism". Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge".
Origins.
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In "Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness", Frank Waters tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011 to astrology and the prophecies of the Hopi, while both José Argüelles (in "The Transformative Vision") and Terence McKenna (in "The Invisible Landscape") discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.
In 1983, with the publication of Robert J. Sharer's revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's "The Ancient Maya," each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the Harmonic Convergence event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in "The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology". He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the center of our galaxy, that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 "tuns" (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon. Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.
In 2006, author Daniel Pinchbeck popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book "2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl", linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in crop circles, alien abduction, and personal revelations based on the use of hallucinogenic drugs and mediumship. Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date ... e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".
Galactic alignment.
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date. However, its supposed end date has been tied to astronomical phenomena by esoteric, fringe, and New Age literature that places great significance on astrology, especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of axial precession. Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".
Precession.
In the Solar System, the planets and the Sun lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the plane of the ecliptic. From our perspective on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. Presently, the Sun's March equinox position is in the constellation Pisces and is moving back into Aquarius. This signals the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).
Similarly, the Sun's December solstice position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) is currently in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, from the surface of the Earth, appear to come into alignment, and every year, precession causes a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. It is currently about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.
Mysticism.
Mystical speculations about the precession of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in "Hamlet's Mill" (1969) by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by Terence and Dennis McKenna in "The Invisible Landscape" (1975). The significance of a future "galactic alignment" was noted in 1991 by astrologer Raymond Mardyks, who asserted that the winter solstice would align with the galactic plane in 1998/1999. He wrote that this event "only occurs once each 26,000-year cycle and would be most definitely of utmost significance to the top flight ancient astrologers". Astrologer Bruce Scofield notes, "The Milky Way crossing of the winter solstice is something that has been neglected by Western astrologers, with a few exceptions. Charles Jayne made a very early reference to it, and in the 1970s Rob Hand mentioned it in his talks on precession but didn't elaborate on it. Ray Mardyks later made a point of it, and after that , myself, and Daniel Giamario began to talk about it."
Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by Munro Edmonson, allege that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the Great Rift or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the "Xibalba be" or "Black Road". John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology. Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice. Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind. New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argue that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events. Jenkins attributes the insights of ancient Maya shamans about the galactic center to their use of psilocybin mushrooms, psychoactive toads, and other psychedelics. Jenkins also associates the "Xibalba be" with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.
Criticism.
Astronomers such as David Morrison argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claims he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself notes that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centred on 1998.
There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes. It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices, but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists. There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.
Timewave zero and the "I Ching".
"Timewave zero" is a numerological formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the universe's interconnectedness, or organized complexity. According to Terence McKenna, the universe has a teleological attractor at the end of time that increases interconnectedness, which would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. The scientific community considers novelty theory to be pseudoscience.
McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the King Wen sequence of the "I Ching", an ancient Chinese book on divination, the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's biological and sociocultural evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012. When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.
The 1975 first edition of "The Invisible Landscape" refers to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date of 21 December 2012 throughout.
Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.
Doomsday theories.
The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, described the end of the world, or of human civilization, on that date became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many hoax pages on the Internet, particularly on YouTube. The Discovery Channel was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice accuracy for entertainment".
Other alignments.
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth does not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even if this were not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to be more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary, "Decoding the Past". John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".
Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record. According to this hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it suggests that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its 250-million-year orbit of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25 million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact. However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date. Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc only three million years ago and is now moving farther above it.
A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.
Geomagnetic reversal.
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly referred to as a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100 billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field is weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.
Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete, and do not start on any particular date. Furthermore, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that the solar maximum will peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it will be fairly weak, with a below-average number of sunspots. In any case, there is no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth. Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications. David Morrison attributes the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku, who claimed in an interview with Fox News that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.
Planet X/Nibiru.
Some believers in doomsday in 2012 claimed that a planet called Planet X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling of alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.
Other catastrophes.
Author Graham Hancock, in his book "Fingerprints of the Gods", interpreted Coe's remarks in "Breaking the Maya Code" as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 disaster film "2012".
Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the Web Bot project, a computer program that purports to predict the future using Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected the programmers' claims to have successfully predicted natural disasters, which web chatter could never predict, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.
Also, the 2012 date has been loosely tied to the long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which predicts a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics have argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, is in fact moving farther away from them.
Some media outlets tied the fact that the red supergiant star Betelgeuse will undergo a supernova at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse is certainly in the final stages of its life, and will die as a supernova, there is no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova will not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.
Another claim involved alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, first published in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of "Pravda" claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.
Public reaction.
The phenomenon spread widely after coming to public notice, particularly on the Internet. Hundreds of thousands of websites were posted on the subject. "Ask an Astrobiologist", a NASA public outreach website, received over 5,000 questions from the public on the subject from 2007, some asking whether they should kill themselves, their children or their pets. In May 2012, an Ipsos poll of 16,000 adults in 21 countries found that 8 percent had experienced fear or anxiety over the possibility of the world ending in December 2012, while an average of 10 percent agreed with the statement "the Mayan calendar, which some say 'ends' in 2012, marks the end of the world", with responses as high as 20 percent in China, 13 percent in Russia, Turkey, Japan and Korea, and 12 percent in the United States. At least one suicide was directly linked to fear of a 2012 apocalypse, with others anecdotally reported. A panel of scientists questioned on the topic at a plenary session at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific contended that the Internet played a substantial role in allowing this doomsday date to gain more traction than previous similar panics.
Europe.
Beginning in 2000, the small French village of Bugarach, population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, Pic de Bugarach, was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army. "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told "The Independent" in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' garage for UFOs. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal." In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors. Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event". Two raves were foiled, 12 people had to be turned away from the peak, and 5 people were arrested for carrying weapons. Jean-Pierre Delord was criticised by members of the community for failing to take advantage of the media attention and promote the region.
The Turkish village of Şirince, near Ephesus, expected to receive over 60,000 visitors on 21 December 2012, as New Age mystics believed its "positive energy" would aid in weathering the catastrophe. In the event, only a fraction of that number actually arrived, with a substantial component being police and journalists, and the expected windfall failed to materialise.
Similarly, the pyramid-like mountain of Rtanj, in the Serbian Carpathians, attracted much apocalyptic attention, as many believe an artificial pyramid structure is buried within it that would have emitted a powerful force shield on the day, protecting those within it. Hotels around the base received up to 500 bookings apiece for rooms.
In Russia, inmates of a women's prison apparently experienced "a collective mass psychosis" in the weeks leading up to the supposed doomsday, while residents of a factory town near Moscow reportedly emptied a supermarket of matches, candles, food and other supplies. The Minister of Emergency Situations declared in response that according to "methods of monitoring what is occurring on the planet Earth," there would be no apocalypse in December. When asked when the world would end in a press conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, "In about 4.5 billion years."
In December 2012, Vatican astronomer Rev José Funes wrote in the Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" that apocalyptic theories around 2012 were "not even worth discussing".
Asia.
In China, up to one thousand members of the Christian cult Almighty God were arrested, after claiming that the end of b'ak'tun 13 marked the end of the world, and that it was time to overthrow Communism. Shoppers were reported to be hoarding supplies of candles in anticipation of coming darkness, while online retailer Taobao sold tickets to board Noah's Ark to customers. Bookings for wedding ceremonies on 21 December 2012 were saturated in several cities. On 14 December 2012, a man in Henan province attacked and wounded twenty-three children with a knife. Authorities suspected the man had been "influenced" by the prediction of the upcoming apocalypse. Academics in China attributed the widespread belief in the 2012 doomsday in their country to a lack of scientific literacy and a mistrust of the government-controlled media.
On 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivered a hoax speech for the radio station triple J in which she declared "My dear remaining fellow Australians; the end of the world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if you know one thing about me it is this - I will always fight for you to the very end." Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as "immature" and pondered whether it demeaned her office.
Mexico and Central America.
Those Mesoamerican countries that once formed part of the Mayan empire, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, all organized festivities to commemorate the end of b'ak'tun 13 at the largest Mayan sites. On 21 December 2011, the Maya town of Tapachula in Chiapas activated an eight-foot digital clock counting down the days until the end of b'ak'tun 13. On 21 December 2012, major events took place at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. In El Salvador, the largest event was held at Tazumal, and in Honduras, at Copán. In all of these archaeological sites, Mayan rituals were held at dawn led by shamans and Mayan priests.
On the final day of b'ak'tun 13, residents of Yucatán and other regions formerly dominated by the ancient Maya celebrated what they saw as the dawn of a new, better era. According with official figures from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), about 50,000 people visited Mexican archaeological sites on 21 December 2012, of which, 10,000 visited Chichén Itzá in Yucatán, 9,900 visited Tulum in Quintana Roo, and 8,000 visited Palenque in Chiapas. An additional 10,000 people visited Teotihuacan near Mexico City, which is not a Maya site. The main ceremony in Chichén Itzá was held at dawn in the plaza of the Temple of Kukulkán, one of the principal symbols of Mayan culture. The archaeological site was opened two hours early to receive thousands of tourists, mostly foreigners who came to participate in events scheduled for the end of b'ak'tun 13.
The fire ceremony at Tikal was held at dawn in the main plaza of the Temple of the Great Jaguar. The ceremony was led by Guatemalan and foreign priests. The President of Guatemala, Otto Pérez, and of Costa Rica, Laura Chinchilla, participated in the event as special guests. During the ceremony the priests asked for unity, peace and the end of discrimination and racism, with the hope that the start of a new cycle will be a "new dawn". About 3,000 people participated in the event.
Most of these events were organized by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. While Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners a year, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors in 2012 just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Mayan activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Mayan Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they were excluded from the activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.
Osvaldo Gomez, a technical advisor to the Tikal site, complained that many visitors during the celebration had illegally climbed the stairs of the Temple of the Masks, causing "irreparable" damage.
South America.
In Brazil, Décio Colla, the Mayor of the City of São Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, mobilized the population to prepare for the end of the world by stocking up on food and supplies. In the city of Corguinho, in the Mato Grosso do Sul, a colony was built for survivors of the expected tragedy. In Alto Paraíso de Goiás, the hotels also made specific reservations for prophetic dates. On 11 October 2012, in the Brazilian city of Teresina, police interrupted what was believed to have been an attempted mass suicide by up to one hundred members of a cult headed by self-proclaimed prophet Luis Pereira dos Santos, who predicted the end of the world on the feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida. Santos was subsequently arrested.
In Bolivia, President Evo Morales participated in the quechuan and aymaran rituals, this year organized with government support, to commemorate the Southern solstice that took place in Isla del Sol, in the southern part of Lake Titicaca. During the event, Morales proclaimed this day as the beginning of ""Pachakuti"", meaning the world's wake up to a culture of life and the beginning of the end to wild capitalism, and he proposed to dismantle the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
On 21 December 2012, the Uritorco in Córdoba, Argentina was closed, as a mass suicide had been proposed on Facebook to take place there.
North America.
In the United States, sales of private underground blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements calling attention to the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were closed for the Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat of a shooting similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that they had spent most of their $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 because they believed the world would end in 2012.
Cultural influence.
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, refer to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.
The UFO conspiracy TV series "The X-Files" cites 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentions the Mayan calendar "stopping" on this date. The History Channel aired a handful of special series on doomsday that include analysis of 2012 theories, such as "Decoding the Past" (2005–2007), "2012, End of Days" (2006), "Last Days on Earth" (2006), "Seven Signs of the Apocalypse" (2007), and "Nostradamus 2012" (2008). The Discovery Channel also aired "2012 Apocalypse" in 2009, suggesting that massive solar storms, magnetic pole reversal, earthquakes, supervolcanoes, and other drastic natural events may occur in 2012. In 2012, the National Geographic Channel launched a show called "Doomsday Preppers", a documentary series about survivalists preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.
Hundreds of books were published on the topic. The bestselling book of 2009, Dan Brown's "The Lost Symbol", featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decodes to the Julian date for 21 December 2012.
In cinema the 2009 disaster film "2012" was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a stealth marketing campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic. Although the campaign was heavily criticized, the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770 million worldwide. An article in "The Daily Telegraph" attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicts the Chinese building the "survival arks". Lars von Trier's 2011 film "Melancholia" features a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun onto a collision course with Earth. Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of Magnolia Pictures said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".
The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "A Certain Shade of Green" by Incubus referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "2012 (It Ain't the End)" (2010) performed by Jay Sean and "Till the World Ends" (2011) performed by Britney Spears. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet hoax related to South Korean singer PSY being one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once PSY's "Gangnam Style" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end. Indian composer A. R. Rahman, known for "Slumdog Millionaire", released his single "Infinite Love" to "instill faith and optimism in people" prior to the predicted doomsday.
A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company GM aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which a group of friends drive Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.

FOXO1

Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) also known as forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "FOXO1" gene. FOXO1 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in regulation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by insulin signaling, and is also central to the decision for a preadipocyte to commit to adipogenesis. It is primarily regulated through phosphorylation on multiple residues; its transcriptional activity is dependent on its phosphorylation state.
Mechanism of action.
In its un-phosphorylated state, FOXO1 is localized to the nucleus, where it binds to the insulin response sequence located in the promoter for glucose 6-phosphatase and increases its rate of transcription. FOXO1, through increasing transcription of glucose-6-phosphatase, indirectly increases the rate of hepatic glucose production. However, when FOXO1 is phosphorylated by Akt on Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319, it is excluded from the nucleus, where it is then ubiquitinated and degraded. Phosphorylation of FOXO1 by Akt subsequently decreases the hepatic glucose production through a decrease in transcription of glucose 6-phosphatase.
Function.
Adipogenesis.
Recent research has demonstrated that FOXO1 also negatively regulates adipogenesis. Presently, the exact mechanism by which this is accomplished is not entirely understood. In the currently accepted model, FOXO1 negatively regulates adipogenesis by binding to the promoter sites of PPARG and preventing its transcription. Rising levels of PPARG are required to initiate adipogenesis; by preventing its transcription, FOXO1 is preventing the onset of adipogenesis. During stimulation by insulin, FOXO1 is excluded from the nucleus and is subsequently unable to prevent transcription of PPARG and inhibit adipogenesis. However, there is substantial evidence to suggest that there are other factors that mediate the interaction between FOXO1 and the PPARG promoter, and that inhibition of adipogenesis is not entirely dependent on FOXO1 preventing transcription of PPARG. Other research demonstrates that the failure to commit to adipogenesis is primarily due to active FOXO1 arresting the cell in G0/G1 through activation of yet unknown downstream targets, with a putative target being SOD2.
FOXO1 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors that are characterized by a distinct fork head domain. The specific function of this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic growth and differentiation. FOXO1 is essential for the maintenance of human ESC pluripotency. This function is probably mediated through direct control by FOXO1 of OCT4 and SOX2 gene expression through occupation and activation of their respective promoters. In hepatic cells this transcription factor seems to increase the expression of PEPCK and glycogen-6-phosphatase (the same enzymes that are blocked via the metformin/AMPK/SHP pathway). Blocking this transcription factor offers an opportunity for novel therapies for diabetes mellitus. In pancreatic alpha-cells FOXO1 is important in regulating prepro-glucagon expression. In pancreatic beta cells FOXO1 mediates glucagon-like peptide-1 effects on pancreatic beta-cell mass.
Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
When the level of blood glucose is high, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin then causes the activation of PI3K, which subsequently phosphorylates Akt. Akt then phosphorylates FOXO1, causing nuclear exclusion. This phosphorylated FOXO1 is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 is irreversible; this prolongs insulin's inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism and hepatic liver production. Transcription of glucose 6-phosphatase subsequently decreases, which consequently decreases the rates of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Certain research groups have also recently suggested that FOXO1 also activates transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is required for gluconeogenesis. Recent research has demonstrated that the activity of FOXO1 is also regulated through CBP induced acetylation on Lys-242, Lys-245, and Lys-262. These lysine residues are located within the DNA-binding domain; acetylation inhibits the ability of FOXO1 to interact with the glucose-6 phosphatase promoter by decreasing the stability of the FOXO1-DNA complex. Additionally, this acetylation increases the rate of phosphorylation on Ser-253 by Akt. Interestingly, mutating Ser-253 to Ala-253 makes FOXO1 constitutionally active. Further research has demonstrated that SIRT1 reverses this acetylation process; however, the exact mechanism by which SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO1 is still under investigation; presently, acetylation is thought to mitigate the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and thereby provide an additional level of metabolic regulation that is independent of the insulin/PI3K pathway.
Clinical significance.
Because FOXO1 provides a link between transcription and metabolic control by insulin, it is also a potential target for genetic control of type 2 diabetes. In the insulin-resistant murine model, there is increased hepatic glucose production due to a loss in insulin sensitivity; the rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are increased when compared to normal mice; this is presumably due to un-regulated FOXO1. When the same experiment was repeated with haploinsufficient FOXO1, insulin sensitivity was partially restored, and hepatic glucose production subsequently decreased. Similarly, in mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD), there is increased insulin resistance in skeletal and liver cells. However, when haploinsufficient FOXO1 mice were treated with the same HFD, there was a notable decrease in insulin resistance in both skeletal and liver cells. This effect was significantly augmented by the simultaneous administration of rosiglitazone, which is a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drug. These results create an opportunity for a novel gene therapy based approach to alleviating insulin desensitization in type 2 diabetes. Current research is investigating the potential of combining FOXO1 and Notch-1 haploinsufficiency in mice; preliminary results suggest that in HFD-fed mice, the combination of FOXO1 and Notch-1 haploinsufficiency was more effective at restoring insulin sensitivity than FOXO1 haploinsufficiency alone.
Translocation of this gene with PAX3 has been associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.
Interactions.
FOXO1 has been shown to interact with:

Armand de Waele

Armand de Waele (1887–1966) was a British chemist, noted for his contributions to rheology, and after whom the Ostwald-de Waele relationship for non-Newtonian fluids is named.
de Waele was born in Islington, London, in 1887, the son of a Belgian father and French mother. He held dual nationality until the age of 21, when he chose to be a British rather than Belgian. He obtained a BSc from the Regent Street Polytechnic then worked in the paint and linoleum industries. In 1914 he married a Frenchwoman with whom he had two sons, and the same year was conscripted into the Royal Flying Corps.
After the First World War he joined Gestetner as Chief Research Chemist, where he remained till 1957 when he retired. During this period he published 30 papers on rheology and patents on duplicating as well as a book. He was a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry and of the Institute of Physics.

Peter Lampe

Peter Lampe (born 28 January 1954) is a German theologian and Professor of New Testament Studies at the University of Heidelberg in Germany.
After studies in theology, philosophy and archaeology at Bielefeld and Göttingen, Germany, and Rome, Italy, he received his Ph.D. and his Dr. habil. at the University of Bern in Switzerland with works about the social history of the Christians in the city of Rome in the first two centuries and about the concept of ecclesiastical unity in the Pauline letters. As assistant professor (“Wissenschaftlicher Assistent“), he taught at the University of Bern from 1981 on, until, in 1986, he was called to a chair of New Testament Studies at Union Theological Seminary in Virginia, USA. In 1992, he took the chair of History and Archaeology of Early Christianity and Its Environment at the University of Kiel in Germany, where he also served as dean of the school of theology. In 1999, he accepted a call to the University of Heidelberg.
His works focus on the social history of early Christianity (groundbreaking studies on, for example, early Christianity in Rome in the 1st/2nd centuries, and on Paul’s correspondence with Philemon; his work also contributed decisively to the paradigm shift toward a more contextual reading of the Letter to the Romans); on the Hellenistic background of early Christianity; on Pauline studies (including rhetorical studies); on early Christian archaeology and epigraphy; as well as on methodological and hermeneutical questions. He pioneered applying constructivist categories to New Testament exegesis and hermeneutics. Furthermore, he was one of the first to explore the potential of psychological interpretation in his field.
Since 2001, he has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, Pepouza and Tymion. The Montanist patriarch resided at Pepouza, and the Montanists expected the heavenly Jerusalem to descend to earth at Pepouza and Tymion. In late antiquity, both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century.
In 2003, Lampe received the German "Ecumenical Preaching Award" (Bonn, Germany). In 2008, he was made honorary professor at the University of the Free State in South Africa. In 2005, he co-founded the "Research Center for International and Interdisciplinary Theology" (FIIT) at the University of Heidelberg, and in 1997 he founded the "Societas Theologicum Adiuvantium" in Kiel. He is a K.St.J. (Germany) and an ordained Lutheran minister. He is married to Margaret Birdsong and has two children, Daniel and Jessica.

Donkey-hide gelatin

Donkey-hide gelatin or ass-hide glue () is gelatin obtained from the skin of the donkey ("equus asinus") by soaking and stewing. It is used as an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is called ejiao ().
The gelatin is produced in several coastal provinces of China: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong. Shandong's Dong'e County was where "ejiao" got its name.
According to a ca. 1723 account by the French Jesuits Dominique Parrenin, there was a well in Dong'e which was normally kept closed and sealed, and which was only opened when water was taken to be used in preparation of "ejiao" for the emperor's court.
Manufacture.
According to Parennin, the product was traditionally prepared during the late fall and winter (from after the harvest and until the beginning of March). It was supposed to be made from the skin of a recently killed well-nourished black donkey. Since the supply of this material was rather limited it was said that a large amount of "fake" ejiao was also manufactured, using skins from mules, horses, camels, pigs, and sometimes, it was said, even from old shoes; a bit of "real stuff" was added to it, to deceive consumers.
Ejiao is either prepared as dry gelatin or mixed with powdered oyster shell or pollen to form glue balls. It tastes sweet. 
Jesuits noted that while the "real" "ejiao" has no disagreeable taste or smell, the fake product could be distinguished by its unpleasant smell and taste, even when it was made from pig skins (which, supposedly, provided the best approximation of the real thing).
Applications.
It is used for several different types of complaint. An amount of 5 to 10 grams may be dissolved in hot water or wine and mixed with other ingredients in the traditional Chinese "materia medica" or taken alone. It is used for a variety of conditions including bleeding, dizziness, insomnia and a dry cough.
The edible form of "ejiao" is often mixed with almonds and sesame seeds and served as a snack that in Shandong. It can also be used as an edible coating for dates, producing another type of snack.
Quite a few manufacturers produce an "ejiao" bar called "Gu Yuan Gao" (固元膏) in Shandong province. Gu Yuan Gao is a bar made up of "ejiao", nuts, sesame, Chinese dates and cooking wine.
It is also used for applying "di mo", a special paper-like musical reed membrane, to the "dizi", a transverse Chinese flute; it dries quickly, holds quite firmly, and is water soluble, allowing later replacement of "di mo".

Father Ralph S. Pfau, also known as Father John Doe (10 November 1904 - 19 February 1967) was the author of "Sobriety Without End", "Sobriety and Beyond" and the Golden Book series. He is believed to have been the first Roman Catholic priest to enter Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).
Early life.
Pfau was born on November 10, 1904, the youngest of five brothers. A sixth brother had died before he was born. His father, who was of French descent, died when Pfau was four. Pfau was raised by his mother, who came from an Indiana German family.
They were devout Catholics. Several family members had served the church: his Uncle George was a priest. His Uncle Al was the Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee. His older brother Jerome was a priest who had earned a doctorate from Rome, and taught at St. Mary-of-the-Woods College.
Ralph’s mother referred to him as her son who was going to become a priest, which created pressure on him as he was growing up.
Education.
He was ordained at St. Meinrad Seminary, and received an Master of Arts in Education at Fordham University. 
He became a priest in the Archdiocese of Indianapolis,
Career.
On June 29, 1942 Pfau was appointed pastor of St. Ann's of Indianapolis by Bishop Ritter. Pfau remained in service at St. Ann's until June 14, 1943.
He was unsure he wanted to be a priest, and for many years, especially during his periods in sanitariums, and during the worst periods of his alcoholism, he continued to doubt the validity of his ordination. But he eventually came to believe that, though he had not chosen the priesthood, he was chosen for it.
Alcoholism and recovery.
He took his first drink about a year after his ordination. By 1943 he was sufficiently worried about his drinking to investigate A.A. 
He experienced nervous breakdowns and spent time in sanitariums. He was twice relieved of his parish.
Even after achieving sobriety, he continued to be plagued by depressions.
He learned about AA when calling on a parishioner who was thought to be dying but was just passed out from alcohol and drugs. Pfau noticed a copy of the book, "Alcoholics Anonymous" on the shelf. He borrowed and read it. He stopped drinking. Later he read pamphletes on AA left by a member in the church. 
During this period of not drinking he stepped up the medication the doctor had prescribed, a combination of barbital and Dexedrine.
He eventually called the person whose name was on the brochures, Doherty Sheerin, who introduced Pfau to the program.
That was November 10, 1941, Pfau's 39th birthday.
For the next 25 years, despite severe problems with depressions, he never took another drink. For a short time he continued to take medications prescribed by his doctor and by Mayo Clinic. He threw them away after discussing the problem with a doctor familiar with alcoholism.
Helping other alcoholics.
With the approval of his Archbishop, he devoted himself to helping other alcoholics, particularly alcoholic priests. He traveled more than 50,000 miles a year to address meetings, conduct retreats and help individuals.
His retreats were attended by thousands of Catholics and by many more thousands who were not Catholics. His retreat talks were eventually published in a series of 14 "Golden Books". They were so named because when he held the second annual retreat in June 1947, at the request of some of the people who had attended the first retreat his talks were printed in a fifty-six page booklet with a gold cover, and distributed as a souvenir, through the generosity of the owner of the archdiocesan newspaper in Indianapolis. People began requesting copies of "the golden book of your retreat."
In 1948 he founded the National Clergy Conference on Alcoholism, an organization devoted to the problems of priests, and directed it for many years. Its publications, especially "Alcoholism Source Book for Priests," and the annual "Blue Book," made a deep impact on the American Catholic Hierarchy.
Role of religion in Alcoholics Anonymous.
Pfau favored limiting religious references to the absolute minimum in order to avoid offending newcomers.
Quote about Pfau.
"the whole career of Father Pfau can only be understood in the light of the fact that he was a pioneer. He broke new ground. ... Like any pioneer he met opposition and had to have fortitude. Like any Christian innovator he had to have deep faith. It was faith and fortitude that sustained his zeal for the salvation of the countless souls he helped." - Fr. John C. Ford, S. J., in an Epilogue to an edition of Pfau's autobiography, published after his death.

Sarah Lincoln Grigsby

Sarah Lincoln Grigsby (February 10, 1807 – January 20, 1828) was the older sister of the sixteenth president Abraham Lincoln and cared for him when they were young.
Early life.
Sarah Lincoln was born in Elizabethtown, Kentucky to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln in 1807. After their mother's death in 1818, Sarah was in charge of taking care of the house while their father Thomas went off to look for a wife. She also cared for the boy Abe and their cousin Dennis Hanks, who was living with them. Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston in 1819 and brought her home to be a stepmother to his children.
Marriage and family.
In August 1826, Sarah Lincoln married Aaron Grigsby (1801–1831). Sarah died on January 20, 1828, while giving birth to a stillborn boy. Her brother, Abraham, blamed the death of his sister on the failure of Grigsby to send for a doctor. She is buried in a small cemetery next to the Little Pigeon Baptist Church, a Primitive Baptist Church.
The Lincoln family attended the church and the father, Thomas, was a trustee. The church and Sarah's gravesite are located within what is now Lincoln State Park in Indiana.

Fushun process

The Fushun process is an above-ground retorting technology for shale oil extraction. It is named after the main production site of Fushun, Liaoning province in northeastern China.
History.
The Fushun process was developed and utilized for the extraction of shale oil in China during the mid-1920s. The commercial-scale utilization of the process began in 1930 with the construction of "Refinery No. 1". After World War II, the shale oil production was ceased, but 100 Fushun-type oil shale retorts were restored in 1949. In 1950, total 266 retorts were in operation, each with the capacity of 100–200 tons of shale oil per day.
With the discovery of Daqing oil field in the 1960s, the shale oil production declined and Sinopec, an operator of shale oil production these times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant, using Fushun process technology, was established as a part of the Fushun Mining Group. It started production in 1992. In 2005, China became the largest shale oil producer in the world.
In 1985-1986, Sinopec used the Fushun process for a test processing of Jordan's oil shale from the El Lajjun deposit. Although the process was technically viable, the cooperation was halted due to high operation costs.
Technology.
The Fushun process is classified as an internal combustion technology but also includes external gas heating. It uses a vertical cylindrical type shaft retort, with outside steel plate lined with inner fire bricks. The retort has height over and its inner diameter is about . Raw oil shale particles with the size of are fed from the top of the retort. At the upper section of the retort oil shale is dried and heated by the ascending hot gases, which pass upward through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. The pyrolysis takes place at about . The produced oil vapor and gases exit from the top of the retort; hot gases and oil vapors move from the bottom to the top directly, and not diagonally like in Kiviter process. During the pyrolysis process, oil shale is decomposed to shale coke (char), which together with the ascending air-steam is burnt in the lower part of the retort to heat gases necessary for pyrolysis. These gases are recirculated; after leaving retort, they are cooled in a condensation system, where shale oil is condensed, and re-heated in a heating furnace about to before reinserting into the retort. The shale ash exits from a rotating water dish that acts as a seal and cooler at the bottom of the retort.
Retorts are operated in sets and have a heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single retort as in case of the Kiviter retort. Regenerative furnaces are located next to the retorts and they are operating in two cycles – the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to by combustion gases. After the combustion cycle, retort gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating. By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating retort gas. Twenty retorts typically share one condensation system and a set of heating furnaces.
Advantages of the Fushun process include small investment and stable operation. The process is characterized by the high thermal efficiency, but due to the addition of air into the retort, the nitrogen dilutes the pyrolysis gas. In addition, the excess oxygen in retort burns out a part of produced shale oil, which reduce the shale oil yield. The oil yield of the Fushun retort accounts for about 65% of Fischer Assay. Disadvantage of this process is a high water consumption amounting to 6–7 barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil, and great quantities of waste shale. It is not suitable of ores with small size and oil content lower than 5%.
As the capacity of single retort is limited, Fushun process is suitable for small-scale retorting plants, and for processing lean oil shale with low gas yield.
Commercial use.
Fushun process is used only in China. The Fushun Mining Group operates the largest by capacity shale oil plant in the world (Fushun Shale Oil Plant) consisting of 180 Fushun retorts. Each retort processes about 4 tonnes of oil shale per hour.

AlBeMet

AlBeMet is the trade name of the Materion Brush Beryllium & Composites (formerly known as Brush Wellman) company for a beryllium and aluminium composite material derived by a powder metallurgy process. AlBeMet is formed by hot consolidating gas atomized prealloyed powder. Each powder particle contains aluminium between beryllium dendrites producing a uniform microstructure. Since beryllium is the second least dense elemental metal, these alloys are significantly less dense than aluminium. 
Be-Al alloys are primarily of interest to the aerospace industry, due to the weight advantage they provide. They are used in satellites.
Due to the high toxicity of beryllium the machining has to be conducted with caution to prevent exposure of the workers.
Basic properties.
AlBeMet® has a density of 2.071 g/cm³ (0.07482 lb/in³).
Mechanical properties.
The mechanical properties of AM162 have been extensively characterized in all three-product forms. But a significant design database has been developed for the extruded product form. The extruded bar is fabricated by Cold Isostatic Pressing (CIPing) the isotropic spherical aluminum-beryllium powder into semi-dense billets and then canning the billet for subsequent extrusion with a minimum of a 4:1 reduction ratio. Mechanical properties are minimum values at room temperature. Wrought mechanical properties for extrusions are in the longitudinal direction. Transverse properties are generally lower. A number of standard extrusion dies are available. Rolled product is available in a thickness range of 0.063” to 0.313” x 25” (0.16 to 0.795 cm x 63.5 cm) length time’s width dependent on gauge. Mechanical properties for HIP’d, extruded, and/or rolled AlBe metal matrix composites are in the annealed condition.
Fatigue properties.
The fatigue properties of AlBeMet extruded material have been tested using the Krause rotating beam fatigue test utilizing fully reversed cycles with a R= +0.1. The fatigue limit, 1 x 10-7 cycles was about 207 MPa (30Ksi) in the longitudinal direction and 165 MPa (25 Ksi) in the transverse direction. This property is approximately 75% of the minimum RT yield strength, which is two times that of typical fatigue properties of 6061T6 aluminum.
Thermal Properties.
Most important fact in Surface Mount Technology (SMT) circuit board cores is coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).The better the CTE match, the less strain imposed on solder joints. Less strain translates into better fatigue life for solder joints and longer life for the board. Thermal management capabilities, characterized by the thermal conductivity and heat capacity, have also been found to be important factors.
Manufacture of AlBeMet components.
AlBeMet parts can be manufactured with the same techniques normally used for aluminium, meaning that special tools do not need to be developed. However, it's highly carcinogenic properties mean that special precautions must be taken to avoid exposure, although the material is safe to handle when not being worked on.

Frenchman Creek

Frenchman Creek is a spring-fed waterway that begins in Phillips County, Colorado, crosses Chase and Hayes counties in Nebraska and ends at its juncture with the Republican River in Hitchcock County, Nebraska. The length of the waterway is approximately .
History.
Various mills and irrigation works have been built on Frenchman Creek. A 100 barrel roller mill was built on the east side of the falls in Wauneta in 1887 by Blair and Polly. 
In 1888, Champion Mill was built on the Frenchman in the community of Champion by Thomas Scott; it operated commercially, grinding flour and feed grain, from 1888 to 1968. The last functional water-powered mill in Nebraska, it was purchased by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission in 1969 and is preserved as a state historical park.
Frenchman Creek flows into Enders Reservoir near the village of Enders, Nebraska . Enders Dam was built in 1947-1951 as part of the Missouri Basin Program of the Bureau of Reclamation. Water stored at Enders is diverted into the Frenchman-Cambridge Irrigation district. Enders Reservoir State Recreation Area is a popular location for fishing, hunting and other outdoor recreation activities.
Flows in the Frenchman, and associated releases from Enders Reservoir, have declined over the years. The primary cause is believed to be the lowering of water table levels due to groundwater irrigation in the Frenchman Basin. This has reduced the flows of springs that have historically fed the creek. In order to maintain the recreational and wildlife environments on the reservoir, irrigation releases were halted after 2002.

Golden Ticket (The Office)

"Golden Ticket" is the 19th episode of the fifth season of the television series "The Office", and the 91st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 12, 2009. 
In the episode, Michael excitedly starts a Willy Wonka-inspired promotional gimmick providing discounts to customers who receive golden tickets, then tries to blame the idea on Dwight when the promotion appears to cost the company a large amount of money. In a B story, Kevin receives conflicting romantic advice from Andy, Jim and Pam.
The episode was written by Mindy Kaling and directed by Randall Einhorn. It received mixed reviews from critics, and many commented on the selfishness and mean behavior of Michael Scott in the episode. According to Nielsen ratings, "Golden Ticket" was watched by 7.7 million overall viewers the week it aired. In addition to multiple references to "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "Golden Ticket" includes two knock knock jokes involving the KGB.
Plot summary.
Michael (Steve Carell), inspired by Willy Wonka, decides to put five "golden tickets" randomly into five different shipments of paper that will provide Dunder Mifflin clients with a ten percent discount for one year. Michael is initially excited about the promotional gimmick, which prompts him to dress and act like Wonka throughout the day. However, the golden tickets prove to be a problem when all five go to one of their biggest clients, the Blue Cross of Pennsylvania; because Michael did not specify "limit one per customer", the company is owed a fifty percent discount for a whole year. As a result, the Scranton branch is expected to lose a significant amount of revenue which could shut down the branch, making everyone in the office upset with Michael. When angry Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) demands to know who is responsible, Michael claims Dwight (Rainn Wilson) thought of the idea. Michael then tries to convince Dwight to take the fall, explaining that Michael needs the job more than Dwight and insisting it would allow Dwight to focus more energy on his beet farm.
Dwight remains unconvinced. However, when David Wallace comes to the Scranton branch, he explains that the client has decided to make the company their exclusive provider of office supplies due to the idea. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset, especially when the rest of the office plays along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulates Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing to be indifferent about the outcome.
Meanwhile, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) seeks advice from others in the office on how to start a relationship with Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt), the woman he socialized with at the Valentine's Day singles mixer at the office (from the previous episode, "Blood Drive"). Andy (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynne, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and take things slow. Pam (Jenna Fischer), on the other hand, suggests he ask her out immediately and not be afraid to express himself to her. When Lynne visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly he is thinking. He tells her that she has a nice smile and would like to take her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says "Nice...boobs", but Lynne seems flattered by the statement.
Production.
The official "The Office" website included three cut scenes from "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly also makes the remark, "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," to which Oscar replies, "Seriously." In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight to go on a stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping."
The NBC site also featured more than two minutes-worth of clips involving the subplot between Kevin and Lynne, including Andy discussing his new method of being mean to women while courting dates, in response to his recent failed engagement with Angela. Among the deleted scenes are Kevin telling Lynn he will be too busy for three weeks to talk to her and giving a backhanded compliment to her shirt, both at Andy's suggestion.
Cultural references.
The golden ticket promotional gimmick, from which the episode receives its title, is a reference to the golden tickets from the 1964 Roald Dahl novel, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", as well as the 1971 and 2005 film adaptations of the book. Throughout the first half of the episode, Michael wears a purple suit and top hat similar to Willy Wonka, the character responsible for the promotion from which this episode takes its name. Blue Cross of Pennsylvania, the Dunder Mifflin client who receives the Golden Tickets, is a real-life division of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an American health insurance company. After throwing away the Willy Wonka outfit, Michael wears a gray T-shirt advertising the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, a minor league arena football team. One of the excuses Michael uses to avoid David's phone calls is that he is attending an "Obama fashion show", a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.
Dwight Schrute makes knock knock jokes involving the KGB, the secret police and intelligence agency for the Soviet Union. Michael also makes a knock knock joke involving Buddha, with the punch-line that Pam "buttah" (butter, pronounced like Buddha) a slice of bread. Gautama Buddha was a spiritual teacher in the South Asian country Nepal who founded the religion Buddhism. During an office meeting in which Michael asks his employees to come up with other Golden Ticket-like ideas, Andy suggests the breakfast cereal brand Golden Grahams and American sitcom "The Golden Girls" before confessing he does not understand the assignment.
Reception.
In its original American broadcast on March 12, 2009, "Golden Ticket" was watched by 7.7 million overall viewers and received a Nielsen rating of 4.1 among adults aged between 18 and 49, despite directly competing with ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" and CBS's "". For the week of March 9–15, the episode ranked number 10 among adults 18–49, within two shares of the time-period lead in that age group. "Golden Ticket" was number four among all programs in adults 18–34, behind "Grey's Anatomy" and the Tuesday and Wednesday editions of "American Idol". In the 9 to 9:30 p.m. time-slot, the episode also ranked number one among men 18–34 and men 18–49, tied with "Grey's Anatomy" for number one among the broadcast networks in adults 18–34, and tied with "CSI" for number two among adults 18–49.
"Golden Ticket" received mixed reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the selfishness and mean behavior of Michael in the episode. In a "New York" magazine article entitled "Michael Finally Goes Too Far", Will Leitch describes it as "one of the funnier recent episodes", but found Michael's willingness to sell out Dwight unsettling: "Usually, when he’s about to do something over-the-top (like plant drugs on Toby), he backs off at the last second. This time, he's willing to go all the way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring." Leitch, however, said the sweetness of the subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's "Shoe-La-La" shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a "Horse Boat" invention and the KGB knock knock jokes.
Kona Gallagher, of "TV Squad", praised "Golden Ticket", especially the final act: "Between Michael's face and Dwight's conference call, the last ten minutes of this episode were absolutely golden." Gallagher said the episode returned to "season one levels of Michael Scott stupidity", and particularly liked the way Dwight so readily accepted credit once the golden ticket promotion proved to be a success. Nathan Rabin of "The A.V. Club" gave "Golden Ticket" an A- grade and particularly praised Steve Carell's Willy Wonka impression and the way Michael tried to distance himself after the promotional idea went bad. Rabin said, "Tonight’s episode lacked a certain gravity but it delivered the goods, comedy-wise." He also pointed out that the script was technically illogical in that Michael pretended he did not come up with the golden ticket idea despite the documentary camera crew filming his earlier discussions about it.
"Entertainment Weekly" writer Whitney Pastorek described the episode as "kind of cute tonight, and kind of flat in places, and kind of sad." Pastorek said one of the most interesting aspects of "Golden Ticket" was the relationship between Michael and Dwight: "After their respective failed romances with Holly and Angela, Michael and Dwight may be coming to the awkward realization that the most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another, and that may be causing a little tension." Travis Fickett of "IGN" said "Golden Ticket" was a "solid offering", but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into. Fickett said it was "fun to watch Michael squirm" both when he thought he was in trouble, and when he was robbed credit for his good idea; he also liked when Jim encouraged Dwight not to take the fall for Michael, and when the others in the office rallied around Dwight when David Wallace gave Dwight credit for the success.
Alan Sepinwall, television writer for "The Star-Ledger", said Michael acted so "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" that it made the episode unpleasant to watch: "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael could also be a monster." However, Sepinwall said he did think the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been for this story, I might have found 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." Dan Hopper of VH1's "Best Week Ever" strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' in the sense that the characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really frustrating to watch?'"
"Golden Ticket" was voted the eleventh highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite "OfficeTally"; the episode was rated 8.33 out of 10.

Diacamma

Diacamma is a genus of queenless ants belonging to the subfamily Ponerinae. It is distributed from India to Australia and contains about 24 species.
Biology.
A queen caste does not exist in "Diacamma". Unique to this genus, all workers emerge from cocoons with a pair of tiny innervated thoracic appendages ("gemmae") that are homologous with wings. Mutilation leads to a permanent change in lifetime trajectory, because workers lacking gemmae never mate. This is unlike other queenless ants where workers establish a dominance hierarchy to regulate reproduction. In "Diacamma" only one worker retains her gemmae in each colony, she is the gamergate (mated egglaying worker), and she bites off the gemmae of newly emerged workers. Mutilation causes the degeneration of the neuronal connections between the sensory hairs on the gemma's surface and the central nervous system, and this may explain the irreversibility of modifications in individual behaviour.

USS Edward Luckenbach (ID-1662)

USS "Edward Luckenbach" (ID-1662) was a cargo ship and troop transport that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
SS "Edward Luckenbach" was built as a commercial cargo ship in 1916 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation for Luckenbach Steamship Company of New York City. By 1918, she had come under control of the United States Shipping Board. The Shipping Board transferred her to the U.S. Navy for World War I service on 29 August 1918. Assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 1662, she was commissioned the same day as USS "Edward Luckenbach" with Lieutenant Commander A. C. Fickett, USNRF, in command.
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, "Edward Luckenbach" departed New York City on 18 September 1918 for Marseilles, France, carrying United States Army cargo. By the time she returned to New York on 22 November 1918, the war had been over for eleven days, so it was her only wartime voyage as a U.S. Navy ship.
On 18 December 1918, "Edward Luckenbach" was transferred to the Newport News Division of the Cruiser and Transport Force for postwar use as a troop transport. After conversion into a transport, she made three voyages in 1919 from New York and Newport News, Virginia, with cargo for St. Nazaire, France, returning with patients, convalescents, troops, and casuals to the United States.
"Edward Luckenbach" was unable to continue her fourth voyage to Europe — this time from Hampton Roads, Virginia — because of engine trouble. She was lying disabled in mid-ocean in the Atlantic on 15 July 1919 when troop transport USS "Arizonan" (ID-4542A) — herself four days outbound on a voyage from Brooklyn, New York, to St. Nazaire, France — encountered her. "Arizonan" towed her 425 nautical miles (787 kilometers) toward Boston, Massachusetts. The United States Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Ossipee" joined the two troop transports on the afternoon of 17 July 1919. On the morning of 19 July 1919, "Ossipee" took over the towing duty from "Arizonan", freeing "Arizonan" to continue on her voyage to France.
After arriving at Boston under tow, "Edward Luckenbach" was decommissioned on 6 August 1919 and delivered to the Shipping Board the same day for return to Luckenbach Steamship Company.
Once again SS "Edward Luckenbach", she resumed commercial service as a cargo ship, continuing in this role until 1 July 1942 when, during World War II, she mistakenly entered a defensive minefield north of Key West, Florida, struck two naval mines, and sank.
The shipwreck was salvaged to recover the large quantity of tungsten. The wreck was wire-dragged to prevent it from being a hazard to navigation. The wreck is scattered over a wide area in of water.

Drone attacks in Pakistan

Since 2004, the United States government has attacked hundreds of targets in Northwest Pakistan using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency's Special Activities Division. Most of these attacks are on targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Northwest Pakistan.
These strikes began during the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush, and have increased substantially under U.S. President Barack Obama. Some in the media have referred to the attacks as a "drone war". Until recently, the U.S. government had officially denied the extent of its policy; in May 2013 it acknowledged for the first time that four U.S. citizens, including Anwar Al-Awlaki, had been killed in the strikes. Surveys have shown that the strikes are deeply unpopular in Pakistan, where they have contributed to a negative perception of the United States.
There is a debate regarding the number of civilian and militant casualties. An estimated 286 to 890 civilians have been killed, including 168 to 197 children. Amnesty International found that a number of victims were unarmed and that some strikes could amount to war crimes.
Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, has repeatedly demanded an end to the strikes, stating: "The use of drones is not only a continual violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve and efforts at eliminating terrorism from our country". The Peshawar High Court has ruled that the attacks are illegal, inhumane, violate the UN charter on human rights and constitute a war crime. The Obama administration disagrees, contending that the attacks do not violate international law and that the method of attack is precise and effective.
Overview.
Pakistan's government publicly condemns these attacks. However, it also allegedly allowed the drones to operate from Shamsi Airfield in Pakistan until 21 April 2011. According to secret diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks, Pakistan's Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani not only tacitly agreed to the drone flights, but in 2008 requested that Americans increase them. However, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, "drone missiles cause collateral damage. A few militants are killed, but the majority of victims are innocent citizens." The strikes are often linked to anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and the growing questionability of the scope and extent of CIA activities in Pakistan.
Reports of the number of militant versus civilian casualties differ. In general, the CIA and other American agencies have claimed a high rate of militant killings, relying in part on a disputed estimation method that "counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants ... unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent". For instance, the CIA has claimed that strikes conducted between May 2010 and August 2011 killed over 600 militants without any civilian fatalities, a claim that many have disputed. The New America Foundation has estimated that 80 percent of those killed in the attacks were militants. On the other hand, several experts have stated that in reality, far fewer militants and many more civilians have been killed. In a 2009 opinion article, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution wrote that drone strikes may have killed "10 or so civilians" for every "mid- and high-ranking Qaeda and Taliban leader." The Pakistani military has stated that most of those killed were Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that 391 to 780 civilians were killed out of a total of 1,658 to 2,597, including 160 children. The Bureau also claimed that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in strikes on funerals and mourners, a practice condemned by legal experts.
Barbara Elias-Sanborn has also claimed that, "as much of the literature on drones suggests, such killings usually harden militants' determination to fight, stalling any potential negotiations and settlement." However, analysis by the RAND Corporation suggests that "drone strikes are associated with decreases in both the frequency and the lethality of militant attacks overall and in IED and suicide attacks specifically."
A motive that the 2010 Times Square car bomber Faisal Shahzad stated was the repeated CIA drone attacks in Pakistan, his native country.
Drone strikes were halted in November 2011 after NATO forces killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in the Salala incident. Shamsi Airfield was evacuated of Americans and taken over by the Pakistanis December 2011. The incident prompted an approximately two-month stop to the drone strikes, which resumed on 10 January 2012.
In March 2013, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations Special Rapporteur led a U.N. team that looked into civilian casualties from the U.S. drone attacks, and stated that the attacks are a violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan. Emmerson said government officials from the country clearly stated Pakistan does not agree to the drone attacks, which is contradicted by U.S. officials. In October 2013, Amnesty International brought out a detailed study of the impact of drone strikes that strongly condemned the strikes. The report stated that the number of arbitrary civilian deaths, the tactics used (such as follow-up attacks targeting individuals helping the wounded) and the violation of Pakistani sovereignty meant that the strikes could be considered war crimes.
In May 2014, the targeted killing program was described as "basically over," with no attack having occurred since December 2013. The lull in attacks coincided with a new Obama Administration policy requiring a "near certainty" that civilians would not be harmed, a reduced US military and CIA presence in Afghanistan, a reduced al-Qaida presence in Pakistan, and an increased military role (at the expense of the CIA) in the execution of drone strikes.
Statistics.
2) The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates the following cumulative statistics about US drone strikes:
<br>(As of January 2014)
It is stated in a Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) report that of all the drone attack victims since 2004, more than 76% of the dead fall in the legal grey zone, 22% are confirmed civilians (included 5% minors) and only the remaining 1.5% are high-profile targets. A classified Pakistani government report obtained in July 2013 by the BIJ shows details of 75 drone strikes that occurred between 2006-09. According to the 12-page report, in this period alone, 176 of the 746 reported dead were civilians, with a further 200 regarded as probable non-combatants.
U.S. viewpoint.
U.S. President George W. Bush vastly accelerated the drone strikes during the final year of his presidency. A list of the high-ranking victims of the drones was provided to Pakistan in 2009. Bush's successor, Obama, has broadened these attacks to include targets against groups seeking to destabilize Pakistani civilian government; the attacks of 14 and 16 February 2009 were against training camps run by Baitullah Mehsud. On 25 February 2009 Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, indicated the strikes will continue. On 4 March 2009 "The Washington Times" reported that the drones were targeting Baitullah Mehsud. Obama was reported in March 2009 as considering expanding these strikes to include Balochistan.
On 25 March 2010 US State Department legal advisor Harold Koh stated that the drone strikes were legal because of the right to self-defense. According to Koh, the US is involved in an armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their affiliates and therefore may use force consistent with self-defense under international law.
Former CIA officials state that the agency uses a careful screening process in making decisions on which individuals to kill via drone strikes. The process, carried out at the agency's counterterrorist center, involves up to 10 lawyers who write briefs justifying the targeting of specific individuals. According to the former officials, if the briefs' arguments are weak, the request to target the individual is denied. Since 2008 the CIA has relied less on its list of individuals and increasingly targeted "signatures," or suspect behavior. This change in tactics has resulted in fewer deaths of high-value targets and in more deaths of lower-level fighters, or "mere foot soldiers" as the one senior Pakistani official told the "Washington Post". Signature strikes there must be supported by two sources of corroborating intelligence. Sources of intel include information from a communication intercept, a visual of millitant training camps or intel from CIA assets on the ground. "Signature" targeting has been the source of controversy. Drone critics make the claim that regular citizen behaviors can easily be mistaken for militant signatures.
US officials stated in March 2009 that the Predator strikes had killed nine of al Qaeda's 20 top commanders. The officials added that many top Taliban and al Qaeda leaders, as a result of the strikes, had fled to Quetta or even further to Karachi.
Some US politicians and academics have condemned the drone strikes. US Congressman Dennis Kucinich asserted that the United States was violating international law by carrying out strikes against a country that never attacked the United States. Georgetown University professor Gary D. Solis asserts that since the drone operators at the CIA are civilians directly engaged in armed conflict, this makes them "unlawful combatants" and possibly subject to prosecution.
US military reports asserted that al Qaeda is being slowly but systematically routed because of these attacks, and that they have served to sow the seeds of uncertainty and discord among their ranks. They also claimed that the drone attacks have addled and confused the Taliban, and have led them to turn against each other. In July 2009 it was reported that (according to US officials) Osama Bin Laden's son Saad bin Laden was believed to have been killed in a drone attack earlier in the year.
During a protest against drone attacks, in an event sponsored by Nevada Desert Experience, Father Louie Vitale, Kathy Kelly, Stephen Kelly, SJ, Eve Tetaz, John Dear, and others were arrested outside Creech Air Force Base on Wednesday 9 April 2009.
In May 2009 it was reported that the US was sharing drone intelligence with Pakistan. Leon Panetta reiterated on 19 May 2009 that the US intended to continue the drone attacks.
In December 2009 expansion of the drone attacks was authorized by President Barack Obama to parallel the decision to send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan. Senior US officials are reportedly pushing for extending the strikes into Quetta in Balochistan against the Quetta Shura. Speaking at a news conference in Islamabad on 7 January 2010 Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman stated the drone attacks were effective and would continue but stated that US would make greater efforts to prevent collateral damage. In an effort to strengthen trust with Pakistan 'US sharing drone surveillance data with Pakistan, says Mike Mullen '
US defence budget for 2011 asked for a 75% increase in funds to enhance the drone operations.
The Associated Press (AP) noted that Barack Obama apparently expanded the scope and increased the aggressiveness of the drone campaign against militants in Pakistan after taking office. According to the news agency, the US increased strikes against the Pakistani Taliban, which earned favor from the Pakistani government, resulting in increased cooperation from Pakistani intelligence services. Also, the Obama administration toned down the US government's public rhetoric against Islamic terrorism, garnering better cooperation from other Islamic governments. Furthermore, with the drawdown of the war in Iraq, more drones, support personnel, and intelligence assets became available for the campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since Obama took office, according to the AP, the number of drones operated by the CIA over Afghanistan and Pakistan doubled.
According to some current and former counterterrorism officials, the Obama administration's increase in the use of drone strikes is an unintended consequence of the president's executive orders banning secret CIA detention centers and his attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and capturing prisoners has become a "less viable option". Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia alleged that, "Their policy is to take out high-value targets, versus capturing high-value targets... They are not going to advertise that, but that's what they are doing." Obama's aides argued that it is often impossible to capture targets in the tribal areas of Pakistan and Yemen, and that other targets are in foreign custody thanks to American tips. Obama's counter-terrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, said that, "The purpose of these actions is to mitigate threats to U.S. persons' lives," and continued, "It is the option of last recourse. So the president, and I think all of us here, don't like the fact that people have to die. And so he wants to make sure that we go through a rigorous checklist: The infeasibility of capture, the certainty of the intelligence base, the imminence of the threat, all of these things." In response to the concerns about the number of killings, Jeh C. Johnson stated, "We have to be vigilant to avoid a no-quarter, or take-no-prisoners policy."
A study called 'The Year of the Drone" published in February 2010 by the New America Foundation found that from a total of 114 drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and early 2010, approximately between 834 and 1,216 individuals had been killed. About two thirds of whom were thought to be militants and one third were civilians.
On 28 April 2011, president Barack Obama appointed General David Petraeus as director of the CIA overseeing the drone attacks. According to Pakistani and American officials this could further inflame relations between the two nations.
According to the "Washington Post", as of September 2011, around 30 Predator and Reaper drones were operating under CIA direction in the Afghanistan/Pakistan area of operations. The drones are flown by United States Air Force pilots located at an unnamed base in the United States. US Department of Defense armed drones, which also sometimes take part in strikes on terrorist targets, are flown by US Air Force pilots located at Creech Air Force Base and Holloman Air Force Base. The CIA drones are operated by an office called the Pakistan-Afghanistan Department, which operates under the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC), based at CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. As of September 2011, the CTC had about 2,000 people on staff.
US President Obama affirmed on 30 January 2012 that the US was conducting drone strikes in Pakistan. He stressed that civilian casualties in the strikes were low. In a February 2012 poll of 1,000 US adults, 83% of them (77% of the liberal Democrats) replied they support the drone strikes. The Obama administration offered its first extensive explanation on drone-strike policy in April 2012, concluding that it was "legal, ethical, and wise". The CIA's general counsel, Stephen Preston, in a speech entitled "CIA and the Rule of Law" at Harvard Law School on 10 April 2012, claimed the agency was not bound by the laws of war; in response, Human Rights Watch called for the strike program to be brought under the control of the US military. In May, the US began stepping up drone attacks after talks at the NATO summit in Chicago did not lead to the progress it desired regarding Pakistan's continued closure of its Afghan borders to the alliance's supply convoys.
In 2013, the sustained and growing criticism of his drone policy forced Obama to announce stricter conditions on executing drone strikes abroad, including an unspoken plan to partly shift the program from the CIA to the ostensibly more accountable Pentagon, In anticipation of his speech, Obama instructed Attorney General Eric Holder to divulge that four U.S. citizens had been killed by drones since 2009, and that only one of those men had been intentionally targeted. Following Obama's announcement, the United Nations' drone investigator, British lawyer Ben Emmerson, made clear his expectation of a "significant reduction" in the number of strikes over the 18 months to follow, although the period immediately after Obama's speech was "business as usual". Six months later, the CIA was still carrying out the "vast majority" of drone strikes. However, no attack has occurred since December 2013, and the drone war was described as "basically over" in May 2014.
At Senator Dianne Feinstein's insistence, beginning in early 2010 staffs of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence have begun reviewing each CIA drone strike. The staff members hold monthly meetings with CIA personnel involved with the drone campaign, review videos of each strike, and attempt to confirm that the strike was executed properly.
One of the leading critics of drones in the US Congress is Senator Rand Paul. In 2013, he performed a thirteen-hour filibuster to try to achieve a public admission from President Obama that he could not kill an American citizen with a drone on American soil, who was not actively engaged in combat. Attorney General Eric Holder responded soon after, confirming that the president had no authority to use drones for this purpose.

Blanchard, assistant professor of Political Science at Columbia University, notes that "the use of drones reflects several on-going historical military developments that, in turn, reflect the culture and values of American society..." In this, he alludes to technological idealism (the pursuit of a "decisive" technology to end war) and the need to seize the moral high ground, by delivering more "humane" approaches to warfare. Military support for the drones remains strong for a host of reasons: expansion of battlespace, extension of an individual soldiers capabilities, and a reduction of American casualties. Support has also been noted across the political spectrum as focus in the Middle East shifted from Stabilization (warfare)|stabilization]] in Afghanistan to antiterrorist strikes aimed at al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan.
Blanchard also points to a shift in how gender is viewed in terms of warfare with the advent of technology in place of human soldiers. Fighters often represent an idealized masculinity, portraying strength, bravery, and chivalry, but during the Gulf War of 1990-91 the focus had changed. The computer programmers, missile technologists, high-tech pilots, and other servicemen who were centred around technology were now the focal point of news coverage, removing the warrior-soldier from the conversation.
Feminist IR theory has critiqued the drone program, beginning with the language surrounding "technowar". Akin to the language used to defend potential nuclear warfare during the Cold War, drone attacks involved "smart" weapons launched by "intelligent" computers," a perspective given by the user, not of the victims of drone attacks. Victims do not enter the discourse of technowar, and rather the main discourse hopes to emphasize the lack of any human body in war itself, overlooking those victimized. The victims are thereby dehumanized, while the triumphs of "humanless" warfare are purported. In terms of military service, technowarfare has actually given women more opportunities in the military. By moving away from on-the-ground fighting to fighting with machines, debates about women not being strong enough to serve in ground forces have lost traction. This evolving "riskless" warfare also raises a number of other questions however. As society typically does not allow women to be considered "protectors." As the military becomes more "unmanned" with the continued use of drones, the role of women in the military becomes more unclear. Further, the practice of "riskless warfare" relies upon aerial bombings that primarily punish foreign noncombatants, which includes women and children. As what is considered "battlespace" continues to expand, the frontlines of war increasingly make their way into domestic space. Remote operators are susceptible to the same stresses and psychological problems frontline soldiers are faced with, and (typically female) care-givers on the homefront are left with more burdens, including an increased risk of domestic violence.
Pakistani position.

Pakistan has repeatedly protested these attacks as an infringement of its sovereignty and because civilian deaths have also resulted, including women and children, which has further angered the Pakistani government and people. General David Petraeus was told in November 2008 that these strikes were unhelpful. However on 4 October 2008 "The Washington Post" reported that there was a secret deal between the US and Pakistan allowing these drone attacks. US Senator Dianne Feinstein said in February 2009: "As I understand it, these are flown out of a Pakistani base." Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi denied that this was true.
On 8 September 2008, a spokesman for the Pakistani army condemned Washington's killing of Pakistani civilians and warned of retaliatory action: "Border violations by US-led forces in Afghanistan, which have killed scores of Pakistani civilians, would no longer be tolerated, and we have informed them that we reserve the right to self defense and that we will retaliate if the US continues cross-border attacks."
The drone attacks continue, despite repeated requests made by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari through different channels. Baitullah Mehsud, while claiming responsibility for the 2009 Lahore police academy attacks, stated that it was in retaliation for the drone attacks. According to "The Daily Telegraph", Pakistani intelligence has agreed to secretly provide information to the United States on Mehsud's and his militants' whereabouts while publicly the Pakistani government will continue to condemn the attacks.
On 28 April 2009 Pakistan's consul general to the US, Aqil Nadeem, asked the US to hand over control of its drones in Pakistan to his government. Said Nadeem, "Do we want to lose the war on terror or do we want to keep those weapons classified? If the American government insists on our true cooperation, then they should also be helping us in fighting those terrorists." President Zardari has also requested that Pakistan be given control over the drones, but this has been rejected by the US who are worried that Pakistanis will leak information about targets to militants. In December 2009 Pakistan's Defence minister Ahmad Mukhtar acknowledged that Americans were using Shamsi Airfield but stated that Pakistan was not satisfied with payments for using the facility.
In December 2010 the CIA's Station Chief in Islamabad operating under the alias Jonathan Banks was hastily pulled from the country. Lawsuits filed by families of victims of drone strikes had named Banks as a defendant, he had been receiving death threats, and a Pakistani journalist whose brother and son died in a drone strike called for prosecuting Banks for murder.
In March 2011 the General Officer Commanding of 7th division of Pakistani Army, Major General Ghayur Mehmood delivered a briefing "Myths and rumours about US predator strikes" in Miramshah. He said that most of those who were killed by the drone strikes were Al-qaeda and Taliban terrorists. Military's official paper on the attacks till 7 March 2011 said that between 2007 and 2011 about 164 predator strikes had been carried out and over 964 terrorists had been killed. Those killed included 793 locals and 171 foreigners. The foreigners included Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Chechens, Filipinos and Moroccans.
On 9 December 2011, Pakistan's Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani issued a directive to shoot down US drones. A senior Pakistani military official said, "Any object entering into our air space, including U.S. drones, will be treated as hostile and be shot down."
The daily Indian newspaper The Hindu reported that Pakistan reached a secret agreement with United States to readmit the attacks of guided airplanes on its soil. According to a high western official linked with the negotiations, the pact was signed by ISI chief Lieutenant General Shuja Ahmad Pasha, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency general David Petraeus during a meeting in Qatar January 2012. According to The Hindu, Lieutenant General Pasha also agreed to enlarge the CIA presence in Shahbaz air base, near the city of Abbottabad, where Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011.
According to unnamed US government officials, beginning in early 2011 the US would fax notifications to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) detailing the dates and general areas of future drone attack operations. The ISI would send a return fax acknowledging receipt, but not approving the operation. Nevertheless, it appeared that Pakistan would clear the airspace over the area and on the dates designated in the US fax. After the May 2011 raid that killed bin Laden, the ISI ceased acknowledging the US faxes, but Pakistani authorities have appeared to continue clearing the airspace in the areas where US drones are operating. According to an unnamed Pakistani government official, the Pakistan government believes that the US sends the faxes primarily to support legal justification for the drone attacks.
In May 2013, a Pakistani court ruled that CIA drone strikes in Pakistan were illegal. A Peshawar High Court judge said the Pakistani government must end drone strikes, using force if needed. Also at that time, an International Crisis Group report concluded that drone strikes were an "ineffective" way of combating militants in Pakistan. A week later, the Pakistani Taliban withdrew an offer of peace talks after a drone strike killed their deputy leader. The Pakistani Taliban's threat to "teach a lesson" to the US and Pakistan, after the aggressive American rejection of peace talks, resulted in the shooting of 10 foreign mountain climbers, as well as a mis-targeted bomb killing fourteen civilians, including four children, instead of security forces in Peshawar at the end of June 2013. In early June, it was reported that the CIA did not even know who it was killing in some drone strikes. A few days later, the freshly elected Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, called for an end to drone strikes in his country. Not long after, a US strike killed another nine people, an act that prompted Sharif to summon the US chargé d'affaires in protest and to demand, again, an "immediate halt" to the Anglo-American assassination programme. At the beginning of July 2013—as a drone strike killed another 17 people in Waziristan—the findings of a Center for Naval Analyses study, based on classified US military documents, were reported: American drones strikes were 10 times more likely to cause innocent casualties than bombs or missiles launched from planes.
In July 2013, it was reported that the US had drastically scaled back drone attacks in order to appease the Pakistani military, which was under growing pressure to move to end American "airspace violations". The CIA was instructed to be more "cautious" and limit the drone strikes to high-value targets, to cut down on so-called signature strikes (attacks that target a group of militants based purely on their behavior). Pakistani military officials had earlier stated that these drone attacks cannot continue at the tempo they are going at, and that civilian casualties in these strikes are spawning more militants.
On 1 November 2013, the US killed Hakimullah Mehsud. The expressions of anger in Pakistan about the continuance of drone strikes peaked again at the end of November as a political party announced publicly the alleged name of the CIA's station chief in Islamabad, and called for them and CIA director John Brennan to be tried for murder.
After a six-month break, June 2014 saw a drone strike kill 13 people; the attack was again condemned by Pakistan as a violation of its sovereignty.
Media reporting from other countries.
The British newspaper "The Times" stated on 18 February 2009 that the CIA was using Pakistan's Shamsi Airfield, southwest of Quetta and from the Afghan border, as its base for drone operations. Safar Khan, a journalist based in the area near Shamsi, told the "Times", "We can see the planes flying from the base. The area around the base is a high-security zone and no one is allowed there."
Top US officials confirmed to Fox News Channel that Shamsi Airfield had been used by the CIA to launch the drones since 2002.
Al Qaeda response.
Messages recovered from Osama bin Laden's home after his death in 2011, including one from then al Qaeda No. 3, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman reportedly, according to the Agence France-Presse and the "Washington Post", expressed frustration with the drone strikes in Pakistan. According to an unnamed U.S. Government official, in his message al-Rahman complained that drone-launched missiles were killing al Qaeda operatives faster than they could be replaced.
In June and July 2011, law enforcement authorities found messages on al Qaeda-linked websites calling for attacks against executives of drone aircraft manufacturer AeroVironment. Law enforcement believed that the messages were in response to calls for action against Americans by Adam Yahiye Gadahn.
United Nations human rights concerns.
On 3 June 2009, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) delivered a report sharply critical of US tactics. The report asserted that the US government has failed to keep track of civilian casualties of its military operations, including the drone attacks, and to provide means for citizens of affected nations to obtain information about the casualties and any legal inquests regarding them. Any such information held by the U.S. military is allegedly inaccessible to the public due to the high level of secrecy surrounding the drone attacks program. The US representative at UNHRC has argued that the UN investigator for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions does not have jurisdiction over US military actions, while another US diplomat claimed that the US military is investigating any wrongdoing and doing all it can to furnish information about the deaths.
On 27 October 2009 UNHRC investigator Philip Alston called on the US to demonstrate that it was not randomly killing people in violation of international law through its use of drones on the Afghan border. Alston criticized the US's refusal to respond to date to the UN's concerns. Said Alston, "Otherwise you have the really problematic bottom line, which is that the Central Intelligence Agency is running a program that is killing significant numbers of people and there is absolutely no accountability in terms of the relevant international laws."
On 2 June 2010 Alston's team released a report on its investigation into the drone strikes, criticizing the United States for being "the most prolific user of targeted killings" in the world. Alston, however, acknowledged that the drone attacks may be justified under the right to self-defense. He called on the US to be more open about the program. Alston's report was submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights the following day.
On 7 June 2012, after a four-day visit to Pakistan, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for a new investigation into US drone strikes in Pakistan, repeatedly referring to the attacks as "indiscriminate," and said that the attacks constitute human rights violations. In a report issued on 18 June 2012, Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, called on the US' Obama administration to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture al Qaeda or Taliban suspects.
Reactions from people in Waziristan.
According to a report by researchers at Stanford and New York University law schools in 2012,
Civilians in Waziristan interviewed for the report believed "that the US actively seeks to kill them simply for being Muslims, viewing the drone campaign as a part of a religious crusade against Islam." Many professionals working in Waziristan believe that drone strikes encourage terrorism. The report notes similar conclusions reached by reporters for "Der Spiegel", "The New York Times" and CNN.
According to ongoing surveys of public opinion conducted by the New America Foundation, 9 out of 10 of civilians in Waziristan "oppose the U.S. military pursuing al-Qaeda and the Taliban" and nearly 70% "want the Pakistani military alone to fight Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in the tribal areas."
According to a public opinion survey conducted between November 2008 and January 2009 by the Pakistani Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy, approximately half of the respondents considered drone strikes in Federally Administered Tribal Areas accurate and approximately the same number of respondents said that the strikes did not lead to anti-American sentiment and were effective in damaging the militants. The researchers concluded that "the popular notion outside the Pakhtun belt that a large majority of the local population supports the Taliban movement lacks substance." According to Farhat Taj a member of AIRRA the drones have never killed any civilians. Some people in Waziristan compare the drones to Ababils, the holy swallows sent by Allah to avenge Abraha, the invader of the Khana Kaaba. Irfan Husain, writing in "Dawn", agreed called for more drone attacks: "We need to wake up to the reality that the enemy has grown very strong in the years we temporized and tried to do deals with them. Clearly, we need allies in this fight. Howling at the moon is not going to get us the cooperation we so desperately need. A solid case can be made for more drone attacks, not less." In October 2013, the Economist found support among locals for the drone attacks as protection against the militants, claiming no civilians were killed this year.
The "Los Angeles Times" has reported that in North Waziristan a militant group called Khorasan Mujahedin targets people suspected of being informants. According to the report, the group kidnaps people from an area suspected of selling information that led to the strike, tortures and usually kills them, and sells videotapes of killings in street markets as warnings to others.
Civilian casualties.
According to unnamed counterterrorism officials, in 2009 or 2010 CIA drones began employing smaller missiles in airstrikes in Pakistan in order to reduce civilian casualties. The new missiles, called the Small Smart Weapon or Scorpion, are reportedly about the size of a violin case (21 inches long) and weigh 16 kg. The missiles are used in combination with new technology intended to increase accuracy and expand surveillance, including the use of small, unarmed surveillance drones to exactly pinpoint the location of targets. These "micro-UAVs" (unmanned aerial vehicles) can be roughly the size of a pizza platter and meant to monitor potential targets at close range, for hours or days at a time. One former U.S. official who worked with micro-UAVs said that they can be almost impossible to detect at night. "It can be outside your window and you won't hear a whisper," the official said. The drone operators also have changed to trying to target insurgents in vehicles rather than residences to reduce the chances of civilian casualties.
The New York Times reported in 2013 that the Obama Administration embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties, which in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants, giving partial explanation to the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths.
A January 2011 report by "Bloomberg" stated that civilian casualties in the strikes had apparently decreased. According to the report, the U.S. Government believed that 1,300 militants and only 30 civilians had been killed in drone strikes since mid-2008, with no civilians killed since August 2010.
On 14 July 2009, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution stated that although accurate data on the results of drone strikes is difficult to obtain, it seemed that ten civilians had died in the drone attacks for every militant killed. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America. He suggested that the real answer to halting al-Qaeda's activity in Pakistan will be long-term support of Pakistan's counterinsurgency efforts.
United States officials claim that interviews with locals do not provide accurate numbers of civilian casualties because relatives or acquaintances of the dead refuse to state that the victims were involved in militant activities.
The CIA reportedly passed up three chances to kill militant leaders, including Sirajuddin Haqqani, with drone missiles in 2010 because women and children were nearby. The New America Foundation believes that between zero and 18 civilians have been killed in drone strikes since 23 August 2010 and that overall civilian casualties have decreased from 25% of the total in prior years to an estimated 6% in 2010. The Foundation estimates that between 277 and 435 non-combatants have died since 2004, out of 1,374 to 2,189 total deaths.
According to a report of the Islamabad-based Conflict Monitoring Center (CMC), as of 2011, more than 2000 persons have been killed, and most of those deaths were civilians. The CMC termed the CIA drone strikes as an "assassination campaign turning out to be revenge campaign", and showed that 2010 was the deadliest year so far as regards casualties resulting from drone attacks, with 134 strikes inflicting over 900 deaths.
According to the "Long War Journal", as of mid-2011, the drone strikes in Pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians. The New America Foundation stated in mid-2011 that since 2004 2,551 people have been killed in the strikes, with 80% of those militants. The Foundation stated that 95% of those killed in 2010 were militants. and that, as of 2012, 15% of the total people killed by drone strikes were either civilians or unknown. The foundation also states that in 2012 the rate of civilian and unknown casualties was 2 percent, whereas the Bureau of Investigative Journalism say the rate of civilian casualties for 2012 is 9 percent.
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, based on extensive research in mid-2011, claims that at least 385 civilians were among the dead, including more than 160 children.
The CIA has claimed that the strikes conducted between May 2010 and August 2011 killed over 600 militants and did not result in any civilian fatalities; this assessment has been criticized by Bill Roggio from the "Long War Journal" and other commentators as being unrealistic. Unnamed American officials who spoke to the "New York Times" claimed that, as of August 2011, the drone campaign had killed over 2,000 militants and approximately 50 noncombatants.
An independent research site Pakistan Body Count run by Dr. Zeeshan-ul-hassan a Fulbright scholar keeping track of all the drone attacks claims that 2179 civilians were among the dead, out of which 12.4% were children and women. A report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, released 4 February 2012, stated that from under the Obama administration (2008–2011) drone strikes killed between 282 and 535 civilians, including 60 children.
The British human rights group Reprieve filed a case with the United Nations Human Rights Council, based on affidavits by 18 family members of civilians killed in the attacks – many of them children. They are calling on the UNHRC "to condemn the attacks as illegal human rights violations."
A February 2012 Associated Press investigation found that militants were the main victims of drone strikes in North Waziristan contrary to the "widespread perception in Pakistan that civilians... are the principal victims." The AP studied 10 drone strikes. Their reporters who spoke to about 80 villagers in North Waziristan were told that at least 194 people died in the ten attacks. According to the villagers 56 of those were either civilians or tribal police and 138 were militants, with 38 of the civilians dying in a single attack which took place on 17 March 2011. Villagers stated that one way to tell if civilians were killed was to observe how many funerals took place after a strike; the bodies of militants were usually taken elsewhere for burial, while civilians were usually buried immediately and locally.
A September 2012 report by researchers from Stanford University and New York University criticized the drone campaign, stating that it was killing a high number of civilians and turning the Pakistani public against the United States. The report, compiled by interviewing witnesses, drone-attack survivors, and others in Pakistan provided by a Pakistani human rights organization, Foundation for Fundamental Rights, concluded that only 2% of drone strike victims are "high-level" militant leaders. The report's authors did not estimate the numbers of total civilian casualties, but suggested that the February 2012 Bureau of Investigative Journalism report was more accurate than the "Long War Journal" report (both detailed above) on civilian casualties. The report also opined that the drone attacks were violations of international law, because the US government had not shown that the targets were direct threats to the US. The report further noted the US policy of considering all military-age males in a strike zone as militants following the air strike unless exonerating evidence proves otherwise. Media outlets were also urged to cease using the term "militant" when reporting on drone attacks without further explanation.
In an interview in October 2013, one former drone operator described events suggesting that child casualties may go unrecognized in some mission assessments. A week later, Pakistan's Ministry of Defense stated that 67 civilians had been among the 2,227 people killed in 317 drone strikes since 2008. The Ministry said that the remainder of those killed were Islamic militants.
Naming the Dead.
A UK-based independent group The Bureau of Investigative Journalism launched a project "Naming the Dead" on 24 September 2013, to prepare list of those individuals (civilians and militants) killed in the strikes. The work is based on the bureau's two years research and data collection on drone strikes and their casualties. At launch they published names of 550 people killed in those strikes. A dedicated website has been created that will contain the Names and bio-data of those who have been reported killed.
Waziristan Peace March.
Imran Khan, chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party in Pakistan, announced a Peace March to South Waziristan on 6–7 October 2012 to create global awareness about innocent civilian deaths in US drone attacks. He proposed to take a rally of 100,000 people from Islamabad to South Waziristan. The South Waziristan administration denied the group permission for the rally on the grounds that they can not provide security, but PTI has maintained that they will go ahead with the Peace March. Many International human rights activists and NGOs have shown their support to the Peace March, with former US colonel Anne Wright and British NGO Reprieve joining the Peace March. Pakistani Taliban have agreed to not attack the Peace rally and offered to provide security for the rally.

International Society for Neurochemistry

The International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) is a professional society for neurochemists and neuroscientists throughout the world.
History.
The idea of an organization like the ISN began in the mid-1950s as scientists began to devote more attention to the discipline of neurochemistry. As the field became more popular, scientists recognized that an international association would be useful in helping to propagate research among themselves. In 1962, Jordi Folch Pi and Heinrich Waelesch proposed the formation of a Provisional Organizing Committee to such a society. The committee eventually came into being in 1963 and had an international membership composed of scientists in the field. Preliminary statues were drafted in 1965 and finalized in 1967 as the Articles of Association of the ISN. At its creation, the society had 226 members.
The ISN began by organizing international and satellite meetings. In 1980, it began offering travel grants for young scientists to attend its meetings. Since that time, it has increased the number of awards it offers, funding travel grants as well as training programs, research in developing countries, and small, specialized medical conferences.
Mission statement.
The mission of the International Society for Neurochemistry is to:
Annual meeting.
The society holds a bi-annual meeting, which generally is organized in collaboration with a regional society, either the European Society for Neurochemistry, the American Society for Neurochemistry, or the Asian Pacific Society for Neurochemistry.
Publications.
The official journal of the ISN is the "Journal of Neurochemistry" currently published by Wiley-Blackwell.
Awards.
The ISN funds various efforts to improve scientists' understanding of neurochemistry. The Committee for Aid and Education in Neurochemistry (CAEN) supports research endeavours conducted by young scientists or scientists from countries which offer limited support for neurochemical research. In the past, the committee has funded proposals for a variety of purposes, including visits to other laboratories, purchase of research equipment, and participation in scientific workshops.
Awards to individuals are overseen by the Travel Grants Committee. The ISN Travel Award Program allows young scientists to attend the ISN Biennial Meeting. The Young Scientist Lectureship Awards allow up to two young scientists to attend the Biennial Meeting and present a thirty-minute lecture on a subject in their speciality.
The ISN also supports research symposia through the ISN Conference Committee (ISN-CC). The committee funds small medical conferences that focus on recent research topics and that have an international focus among their attendees. Also under the jurisdiction of the Conference Committee is the ISN Schools Initiative, which schools in different areas of the world that train neurochemists.

Today it is a grandiose building with a particularly grand entrance, retaining many of the Federalist architectural motifs it was built with. The hill it stands on continues to descend to the river, and the slope supports a residential area of colonial and nineteenth century buildings in good repair.
The school colors are "crimson and olde gold" as stated in the student handbook, The Clipper's Compass. The school emblem is a clipper ship and its official song is "All Hail to Our Alma Mater." The school has a student government for each class and it maintains a three-season athletic program, as well as an award-winning drama program.
Concerning accreditation the handbook says: "Newburyport High School is an accredited member of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and has met the evaluation requirements of the Commission on Public Secondary Schools."

LiLi Roquelin

LiLi Roquelin (born in Toulon, France) is a French-born American adult contemporary music, trip-hop and alternative rock singer, composer and songwriter from Astoria, Queens, New York City. Roquelin is most notable for her songs, "I Saw You", which won Best Music Video at several film festivals, "Blues Alone", "Should you get mad", "Renew", "Keep This For You", "Thank You", "The Only One".
Biography.
Roquelin grew up in the south of France, learning music from her multi-instrumentalist father when she was four years old. She played several gigs as a teenager, both solo and in various bands. She then left France to pursue a career in the United States when she felt the music education in France was too conservative for her and how the country’s music industry seemed to favor French DJs over live singer-songwriters. She first moved to Cleveland-Akron, Northeast Ohio area and fronted Phizzy Lager and then the hard-rock Kent, Ohio band Hate Dies Hard, and released an album with them entitled "Neverending Sundown" in 2006.
After the album’s release, Roquelin was introduced to producer Sean Bilovecky (Disengage), who helped to infuse the sounds of trip-hop with her piano compositions. They co-wrote the song, "I Saw You" together, which was later included in her self-titled EP and became a winner for Best Music Video at the Queens Film Festival in November 2008 and Best Music Video at the 2009 Indie Gathering Film Festival. Later that year, Roquelin moved to New York City.
Roquelin recruited Marc Urselli, a three-time Grammy Award winning engineer to mix and master the recordings from her EP and launched an online crowdfunding campaign to help cover the expenses of the EP, a recording of down-tempo, trip-hop songs with Roquelin moving between English and French accompanied by the piano. "Blues Alone" received an Honorable Mention at the 2009 John Lennon Songwriting Contest.
Roquelin released a full-length album "Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life?" and a music video for "Should you get mad" in February 2010. The video was directed by Arnaud Muller (U2) at RNO Pictures and was in the official selection of ZFF Film Festival (London, Miami, LA). It received the award of 2nd Place for Best Music Video in pop category at the 2010 Indie Gathering Film Festival and Convention. The album also includes a cover of Danny Elfman's “Sally’s Song” (from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) in French.
Her influences are The Beatles, Radiohead, Noel Gallagher, and Ingrid Michaelson; she has performed at One Penn Plaza in NYC for the 9-11 commemoration and has played various venues including The Bitter End in NYC. 
Lifetime (TV network)'s Show "Dance Moms" used Roquelin’s song "Renew" for a dance routine entitled "Sinful" (season 1, episode 9, first air-date 09/07/11). The show used another of her songs "Keep This For You" for a "Hunger Games" inspired dance routine called "The Huntress" on Dance Moms season 2 episode 17 - Lifetime (TV network) (first aired on 06/26/2012). At the end of June 2012, LiLi Roquelin was working on finishing up her 3rd solo studio album. Her previous records landed her diverse placements in documentaries and films.
LiLi Roquelin released a new album "Beautiful Sun" in December 2012. On January 31st 2013 she premiered the music video for her song “Thank You” which appeared on her YouTube page the next day. There is also a mini-documentary on the making of “Beautiful Sun.”.
As of March 2013 she had received over 500,000 hits on YouTube. Her music on "Beautiful sun" melds the two worlds of adult contemporary and exploratory pop. The songs are described as Blue, jazz-influenced trip-hop (title-track), gritty-guitar progressive arrangement ("Try to remember"), minor key pop song with inflections of the blues ("Don't wait"), recalling the works of Sarah Mclachlan, Kate Bush, Tori Amos. Some of the musicians on "Beautiful Sun" are cellist Christopher Marion, guitarist and bassist Askold Buk (Hayley Westenra, Hugh Masekela). 
She composed and arranged all of the music on the album and recruited Grammy winning mixing engineer Marc Urselli and Roman Vail, mastering engineer at JLM Mastering Studios (Moby, Sinead O’Connor, The Black Crowes).
Her song "Blues Alone", off her self-titled solo EP (2008), was her third featured track on Lifetime (TV network)'s show Dance Moms ("Return to Grace", season 3 episode 14, first-aired date April 2, 2013) for the main group dance routine. Dance Moms has a strong fan-base and ratings of 2 to 3 million viewers per episode. The album "Beautiful Sun" has gathered media attention, such as The Los Angeles Examiner and a whole page review in East Coast Paper The Aquarian Weekly with her name featured on the cover, and written by award winning music critics John Pfeiffer.
In September 2013 Roquelin was welcomed by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (The GRAMMYs) as a Voting Member. On September 26, 2013, LiLi Roquelin was invited to perform God Bless America at a corporate event at the elegant Terrace on the Park in New York City. Six-hundred people attended, including NY1, WNYW FOX5, New York Mayoral Candidate Joe Lhota and more.
On November 21, 2013 she premiered her new music video for "The Only One" at a Music & Film event that she presented. It is a One shot (music video) where Roquelin walks down a path while various men appear around her. At the end of the video, the guy she runs into turns out to be ‘The One’. It was directed by Kyle Lavore who has worked on films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Men in Black III. "The Only One" is Track number 5 on album "Beautiful Sun", a Rock song with alternative guitars, inspired in part by her past Rock music experience.
On May 2, 2014 she performed as the opening act for Bruce Sudano (producer for Michael Jackson, Dolly Parton and his wife Donna Summer) at The Bitter End.

Reinhold Röhricht

Gustav Reinhold Röhricht (November 18, 1842 – May 2, 1905) was a German historian of the crusades.
Biography.
He was born in Bunzlau in Silesia (now Bolesławiec, Poland), the third son of a miller. He studied at the Gymnasium in Sagan (now Żagań) from 1852 to 1862, and then attended the Berlin Theological School, where he obtained his licentiate in 1866. He then taught at the Berlin School of Religion, teaching Hebrew and German to the upperclassmen and Latin and Greek to the younger students. From 1867 to 1868 he taught at the Dorotheenstädtische Realgymnasium, then at the Luisenstädtische Realschule until 1875. From then until 1904 he taught at the Humboldtgymnasium, first as Oberlehrer and after 1882 as Professor. In 1904, due to poor health, the Prussian Ministry of Education forced him to retire with a pension. The pension was the same as that given to any other Gymnasium professor, and although it was surprising to others who were aware of Röhricht's fame and importance, he himself "ne sollicita point les hommages et ne rechercha pas les profitables honneures." He died the next year.
Crusade historian.
As Hans E. Mayer says, Röhricht was "an antiquarian rather than a historian", but nevertheless laid the "foundation of all modern crusade research." According to his obituary in The American Historical Review, "his most important work was almost wholly on the crusades, the eight main works published since 1874 comprising probably the most important contribution by any one scholar in this field." "Nul aujourd'hui", wrote the Revue de l'orient latin, "ne pourrait occuper avec les mêmes titres et la même autorité qui lui la grande place qu'il laissera vide dans le domaine spécial de nos études." His scholarly reputation was such that in 1940 American historian John L. La Monte described his "Geschichte des Königreichs Jerusalem" as "a masterful history which left little to be desired", although it was written in "ponderous German"; La Monte favoured it in comparison to the recently published French history by René Grousset. Although the "Geschichte" is now out of date, Röhricht's other "magnum opus", the "Regesta Regni Hierosolymitani", remains useful to modern crusade historians; it is a collection of over nine hundred charters and other documents issued from the royal chancery of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which, until edited and published by Röhricht, had remained scattered throughout dozens of other medieval cartularies. He was also the first historian to collect all the medieval material pertaining to the Fifth Crusade.

White Army, Black Baron

The Red Army is the Strongest (), popularly known as "White Army, Black Baron," is a marching song written by Pavel Grigorevich Gorinshtejn (1895–1961, a.k.a. Pavel Gorin, Pavel Grigorev) and composed by Samuil Pokrass (1897–1939). Written in 1920, during the Russian Civil War, the song was meant as a combat anthem for the Red Army.
History.
The immediate context of the song is the final Crimean offensive in the Russian Civil War by Pyotr Wrangel's troops in July 1920. The second verse refers to the call to a final effort in the Crimea published by the Revolutionary Military Council in "Pravda" on 10 July.
While the song has a separate refrain, the verses repeat the claim that "The Red Army is stronger than all", which came to be the song's conventional title.
The first verse of the song reads as follows:
"Black Baron" was a nickname of Wrangel's, from the alleged penchant of his for wearing (and dressing some of his elite units in) black uniforms. 
Wrangel's offensive was indeed halted by the Red Army, and Wrangel and his troops were forced to retreat to Crimea in November 1920, pursued by both Red and Black cavalry and infantry. Wrangel and the remains of his army were evacuated from Crimea to Constantinople on 14 November 1920.
The song became popular in the early Soviet Union. It was sung in 1923 at the rally in Leningrad against the Curzon Line, the "British seas" acquiring new significance in view of Lord Curzon's ultimatum. In a letter to a school for blind students in the Vologda region, Nadezhda Krupskaya named it as her favourite songs alongside "The Internationale". The phrase "from the taiga to the British Seas" became something of an idiomatic expression used by other authors, e.g. by V. A. Lugovsky in his poem Песни о ветре ("Song of the Wind", 1926).
In its early oral transmission during 1920–1925, the song underwent some variation.
Gorinshtejn later recalled that his original lyrics had four or five verses, and that his original refrain was slightly different from the received version (reading ).
The song was first printed in 1925, and subsequently published under the titles of ("From the Taiga to the British Seas"), ("Red Army") and (" of the Red Army"). It was not until 1937 that the conventional title had settled on ("The Red Army is the Strongest"). During the 1920s to 1940s, the song was reproduced without indication of its authors. It was only in the 1950s that musicologist A. Shilov established the authorship of Gorinshtejn and Pokrass.
The Russian song was adopted by the Chapaev Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War, and it was allegedly sung in a Nazi torture chamber by Czech communist Julius Fučík.
Alternative Russian lyrics were set to the tune during World War II, e.g. (Pyotr Belyi 1941 [http://a-pesni.org/ww2/oficial/vsemnam.htm]).
Even after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the tune is still played as a march during the military parades on Red Square.
Translations and variations.
The tune was also used for communist songs in other languages, including Weimar Germany in the 1920s by German Communists. An early German version with the incipit ("White riffraff, noble scum") was a free translation of the original lyrics:
A popular variant of the song, "Die Arbeiter von Wien," was written by Fritz Brügel in 1927. It became popular through its use by Austrian socialists (see also Republikanischer Schutzbund) who fought the Dollfuss regime in the short-lived Austrian Civil War in February 1934. The German version was further adapted in Turkish, as "Avusturya İşçi Marşı" ("Austrian Workers' March"). The first verse of Brügel's version reads:
New lyrics continue to be set to the tune, such as ("Mother Anarchy is Stronger than All"), reported in the early 2000s in the context of the anti-globalization movement, recorded as being sung in 2003 by one "Sasha of the Belorusian Anarchist Front" as he was mooning the guards on the Polish-Belorusian border.[http://a-pesni.org/novrev/mamaa.htm]

Demographics of New England

In terms of race and ethnicity, White Americans made up 84.9% of New England's population, of which 81.2% were whites of non-Hispanic origin. Black Americans composed 5.7% of the region's population, of which 5.3% were blacks of non-Hispanic origin. Native Americans made up 0.3% of the population, numbering 37,234. There were just over 500,000 Asian Americans residing in New England at the time of the survey, making up 3.5% of the region's population. There were 158,282 Chinese Americans, constituting 1.1% of the region's total population, and 119,140 Indian Americans (0.8%). Japanese Americans numbered 14,501 (0.1%).
Pacific Islander Americans numbered 4,194, 0.03% of the populace. There were 138 Samoan Americans residing in the region. Multiracial Americans made up 1.8% of New England's population. The largest mixed-race group comprised those of African and European descent; there were 84,143 people of black and white ancestry, making up 0.6% of the population. People of Native American and European American ancestry made up 0.4% of the population, and people of Asian and European heritage 0.3%.
Hispanic and Latino Americans are New England's largest minority, and they are the second-largest group in the region behind non-Hispanic European Americans. Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 7.9% of New England's population, and there were over 1.1 million Hispanic and Latino individuals reported in the survey. Puerto Ricans were the most numerous of the Hispanic and Latino subgroups. Over half a million (507,000) Puerto Ricans live in New England, forming 3.6% of the population. There are also just over 100,000 Mexican Americans. The Dominican population is more than 70,000. Americans of Cuban descent are scant in number; there were roughly 20,000 Cuban Americans in the region. People of other Hispanic and Latino ancestries, for example Salvadoran, Colombian, and Bolivian, formed 3.5% of New England's population, and numbered over 492,000.
New England's European American population is ethnically diverse. The majority of the Euro-American population is of Irish, Italian, English, French, and German descent. Smaller but significant populations of Poles, French Canadians, and Portuguese exist as well.
According to the 2006–2008 survey, the top ten largest European ancestries were the following:
English is, by far, the most common language spoken at home. Approximately 82.7% of all residents (11.1 million people) over the age of five spoke only English at home. Roughly 885,000 people (6.6% of the population) spoke Spanish at home, and roughly 1,023,000 people (7.6% of the population) spoke other Indo-European languages at home. Over 313,000 people (2.3% of the population) spoke an Asian or Pacific Island language at home. Slightly fewer (about 2%) spoke French at home, although this figure is above 20% in northern New England, which borders francophone Québec. Roughly 99,000 people (0.7% of the population) spoke languages other than these at home.
The vast majority of New England's inhabitants, roughly 12.3 million people or 86% of the population, were born in the U.S. This includes 2.2% of the population (315,000 people) who were born in Puerto Rico, in a U.S. territory, or abroad to American parents. Altogether, the native population totals roughly 12,630,000 people, or 88.5% of the population. The foreign-born population forms over ten percent (11.5%) of New England's total population. There are roughly 1.6 million foreigners residing in the region. Thirty-five percent of foreigners were born in Latin America, 27.9% were born in Europe, 24.5% were born in Asia, and 6.9% were born in Africa. People born in other parts of North America made up 5.3% of the foreign-born populace. Oceania-born residents formed 0.4% of the foreign population, just over 6,000. Of the 1.6 million foreigners, 47.7% were naturalized citizens of the U.S., and the majority (52.3%) were not U.S. citizens.
The six states of New England have the lowest birth rate in the U.S.
In 2005, the total population of New England was 14,239,724 people, roughly a 50% increase from its 1929 population of 9,813,000. The region's average population density is 221.66 inhabitants/sq mi (85.59/km²), although a great disparity exists between its northern and southern portions. The population density is much greater than that of the U.S. as a whole (79.56/sq mi) or even just the contiguous 48 states (94.48/sq mi).
Three-quarters of the population of New England, and most of the major cities, are in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Their combined population density is 786.83/sq mi, compared to northern New England's 63.56/sq mi (2000 census). The most populous state is Massachusetts, and the most populous city is Massachusetts' political and cultural capital, Boston.
The coastline is more urban than the western parts of the region, which are typically rural, even in urban states like Massachusetts. This is due mainly to historical factors; the original colonists settled mostly on the coastline of Massachusetts Bay. The only New England state without access to the Atlantic Ocean, Vermont, is also the least urbanized. After nearly 400 years, the region still maintains, for the most part, its historical population layout.
New England's coast is dotted with urban centers, such as Portland, Portsmouth, Boston, New Bedford, Fall River, Providence, New Haven, Bridgeport, and Stamford, as well as smaller cities such as Newburyport, Gloucester, Biddeford, Bath, Rockland, Newport, Westerly, and the small twin cities of Groton and New London in Connecticut.
Southern New England forms an integral part of the BosWash megalopolis, a conglomeration of urban centers that spans from Boston to Washington, D.C. The region includes three of the four most densely populated states in the U.S.; only New Jersey has a higher population density than the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.
Greater Boston, which includes parts of southern New Hampshire, has a total population of approximately 4.4 million, while over half the population of New England falls inside Boston's Combined Statistical Area of over 7.4 million.
In 2009, two New England states were among the five highest in the U.S. in divorce rates. Maine was second highest with 13.6% of people over the age of 15 divorced; Vermont was fifth with 12.6% divorced. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, on the other hand, have below-average divorce rates. Massachusetts is tied with Georgia with the lowest divorce rate in the U.S., at 2.4%.
Largest cities.
The most populous cities are as of the 2010 Census (metropolitan areas in parentheses):
During the 20th century, urban expansion in regions surrounding New York City has become an important economic influence on neighboring Connecticut, parts of which belong to the New York Metropolitan Area. The U.S. Census Bureau groups Fairfield, New Haven and Litchfield counties in western Connecticut together with New York City, and other parts of New York and New Jersey as a combined statistical area.
Health.
The six states of New England ranked within the top thirteen "healthiest states" of the U.S. in 2007. In 2008, they all placed within the top eleven states. New England also had the largest proportion of its population covered by health insurance.
For 2006, four states in the region, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, joined 12 others nationwide, where the number of deaths caused by drugs had overtaken traffic fatalities. This was due in part to declining traffic fatalities, and in part to increased deaths caused by prescription drugs.
Data from 2008 comparing national obesity rates by state, four of the six lowest obesity states were Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island. New Hampshire and Maine had the 15th and 18th lowest obesity rates, making New England the least overweight part of the U.S.
In 2008, three of New England's states had the least number of uninsured motorists (out of the top five states); Massachusetts – 1%, Maine – 4%, and Vermont – 6%.
In 2006, Massachusetts adopted health care reform that requires nearly all state residents obtain health insurance, which served as an important model for the federal 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Nursing home care can be expensive in the region. A private room in Connecticut averaged $125,925 annually. A one-bedroom in an assisted living facility averaged $55,137 in Massachusetts. Both are national highs.

<doc id="21539616" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21539616" title="Holy Trinity Church, Hoylake">
Holy Trinity Church, Hoylake

Holy Trinity Church was the most prominent Anglican church in the seaside town of Hoylake, Wirral, England, until its demolition in 1976. It was consecrated on 1 November 1833, and in 1860 it became the Parish Church of Hoose, Little Hoose and Great Hoose. During its lifetime, 2 one daughter churches were built, the nearby St. Hildeburgh's, probably the only dedication to that saint, which is now used as the parish church for Hoylake, and St John's, now the parish church for Meols.
A new second pipe organ was installed at St Hildeburgh's with the cost being raised by public subscription in the 1920s. This organ, built and installed by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool, specified by the organist, Norman Biller, comprised Swell, Great, Choir and Pedal organs with both the Choir and Swell organs being enclosed, instead of just the more usual swell organ only. The motor to power the bellows was replaced in 1970 at a cost of £10,000 and the organ was rebuilt in the 1960s.
Well known former choristers include, Heather Slade-Lipkin - harpsichordist, Pete Price - local radio presenter and DJ, and David Hale - judge.
Demolition.
All that remains of Holy Trinity church today is the graveyard, housing over 200 gravestones and memorials. They include the war graves of 23 Commonwealth service personnel, 11 of World War I and 12 of World War II.
Another interesting fact, Trinity Road was called Church Road, but they had to change the name so not to confuse with Church Road in nearby West Kirby.
The first Holy Trinity, was consecrated in 1834 but declared unsafe and closed in 1974 & demolished soon after, so St Hildeburgh’s became the parish church.

Tony Berti

Charles Anton Berti, Jr. (born June 21, 1972, in Rock Springs, Wyoming) is a former professional American football player who played offensive lineman for four seasons for the San Diego Chargers. Starting at guard and tackle in 1996 and 1997, Tony was an integral member of the Chargers' offensive line. A shoulder injury during training camp in 1998, put Tony on the IR list for most of the season. With a significant number of starters injured and limited maneuverability under the salary cap, the Chargers reluctantly traded Tony to the play-off bound Seattle Seahawks with only five weeks remaining in the season. In 1999, Tony was one of only two free-agents signed by the two-time Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. However, another shoulder injury and subsequent surgery during training training camp sidelined him again for the 1999 season. Tony signed with the Green Bay Packers in 2000. Days into training camp he abruptly announced his retirement.
In 2001, joining former teammates San Diego Charger Kurt Goveau and Denver Bronco Dave Diaz-Infante, Tony was named the starting right tackle for the start-up XFL's Las Vegas Outlaws.

<doc id="21539714" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21539714" title="Northern Ireland Youth Forum">
Northern Ireland Youth Forum

The Northern Ireland Youth Forum (NIYF) is a youth organisation in the United Kingdom, consisting of volunteer members aged between 11 and 25. Winners of the very first MTV voices award in 2011.
NIYF.
The NIYF is a youth led organisation that lobbies, advocates, promotes and fights for the rights of young people in Northern Ireland. The primary aim is to build the confidence and awareness of all young people so that they can assert their rights as listed by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
History.
The Northern Ireland Youth Forum was created by the Department of Education in 1979 to ensure that young people’s opinions were heard and valued by government. As part of the Youth Sector, the Youth Forum was asked to help young people engage in decision-making about the delivery of services such as youth clubs, local youth councils, as well as in wider society.
Today the Youth Forum’s mantra is "‘promoting the voice of young people’", and it works with young people across Northern Ireland to ensure they are able to fully participate in making decisions within their community.
Membership.
The Youth Forum is a member-based organisation, which means that it gets its direction and focus from the young people it is created to work for. Membership is open to all young people living in Northern Ireland aged between 11 and 25 who support the core values and aims of the Youth Forum.
Members are encouraged to take an active role in the life of the organisation, including standing for election to the Executive Committee. Members also receive our monthly email newsletter ‘eBumpfh’ that contains information about current work, training opportunities, and exciting events.
Members are encouraged to keep in touch with the Membership Development Worker to inform them of the work that they are doing in their local area or youth club. Through the online discussion forum Members can talk about issues that they care about, feed into ongoing consultations that are managed by the Youth Forum, and make friends with other Members.
Areas of focus.
The forum lists five main focal points of its work, detailed below.
Executive committee.
The Executive Committee set the strategic direction of the organisation, and are elected every two years from within the membership. It is composed of 15 prominent members of the organisation. They work with staff at an annual strategic planning residential to create the work plan for the following year. The Executive then meet with members twice each year to inform them of the key work of the organisation, including at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting.
The Annual General Meeting is the organisation's largest regular conference, which all members are invited to attend. It gives the membership a chance to consult with the executive committee on the direction which the forum will be taking in the year ahead.
Subgroups.
In order to facilitate the work done by the forum, subgroups are created thus giving a greater sense of focus to members. Each subgroup contains one or more members of the executive committee who feed back information at executive meetings to strengthen internal communications. Current subgroups include:
UK Youth Parliament.
The NIYF also fills the position of a regional body of the UK Youth Parliament; as such it remains involved in national and local campaigns. Currently the forum holds positions on the Procedures group and Board of Trustees of the UKYP.

<doc id="21539762" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21539762" title="Erna Hanfstaengl">
Erna Hanfstaengl

Erna Hanfstaengl (1885–1981) was the elder sister of Ernst ("Putzi") Hanfstaengl and was an acquaintance of Adolf Hitler. She also befriended Unity Mitford, who lived with Erna for a period.
Romantic involvement with Hitler.
Hitler may have been romantically involved with Erna, who was reported to have been beautiful, charming, cultured and intelligent. In the days following the failed Beer Hall putsch, it was rumored that Hitler and Erna had sex while the former was hiding at a country house in Uffing.
Rumors circulated in Munich in 1923 that Hitler and Erna were to be engaged; in the spring of 1923, the most widely read newspaper in Munich, the "Münchener Neuste Nachrichten", published a story to this effect.
It appears that the "tall and stately" Erna had simply been polite to Hitler and had shown courtesy to her brother's friend at their initial meeting in the early 1920s, and Hitler misinterpreted this as romantic affection. Gross claims that Hitler was in love with Erna, but that she considered the whole business to be a joke, and that she was amused at his attempts to court her. According to Gross, she was teased by her society friends about the unwanted affections shown by her "suitor" and made sure that she was never alone with him.
In any event it appears that during the period 1922-23, Erna assisted her brother in his aspirations to become one of Hitler's inner circle, by furthering Hitler's introduction to people of wealth and social standing in Munich.
Several writers claim that, years later, Geli Raubal, Hitler's niece (and possibly his lover for a period, although many authorities doubt their relationship was consummated) was jealous of Hitler's association with Erna.
Plot against Hitler.
According to Heinrich Himmler's Chief of Staff, Walter Schellenberg, Erna was also involved in a plot to overthrow Hitler and to sue for peace with the Allies.
Erna owned a shop in Munich in 1943, and Schellenberg made her acquaintance in March 1943 at Himmler's suggestion. Himmler's wife and Erna were acquainted, and Frau Himmler had suggested to her husband that Erna would be a suitable person to conduct peace negotiations with the English, perhaps because she knew "people of influence" such as Randolph Churchill.
Her peace plan consisted of having Himmler (with the aid of the Waffen SS) abduct Hitler to the Obersalzberg, where he would be held in SS detention. This would allow for the use of the cover story that Hitler was still in control of the government, since he spent much time at Obersalzberg anyway. A Council of Twelve would then constitute the "de facto" government, with Himmler at the head. Erna would then open an art shop in Paris and proceed to open secret negotiations with persons of influence in England, such as Randolph Churchill, whom she claimed to know.
Erna traveled to Paris twice in support of this plan and made contacts, including a former commandant of the French police. Schellenberg and Erna met several times during 1943. He advanced her 500,000 French francs to establish her art-shop cover in Paris, which she did. Nothing, however, came of the plot, and Schellenberg claimed that he himself would not have engaged an agent such as Erna Hanfstaengl, save for the insistence of Himmler.
In May 1944, at Himmler's direction, Schellenberg ceased any further usage of Erna Hanfstaengl as a possible agent for peace negotiations. Schellenberg reportedly objected to her termination as an agent and argued with Himmler for a half-hour over the decision, but to no avail.

Work with colour.
In the 1980s Patrick Baty produced a range of paint colours based on those offered by a Scottish house-painter in 1807, this sparked off the present wave of historically-themed paint ranges which are still seen today. In April 2000, Homes & Gardens described him as being “Undoubtedly the most influential of our (paint) experts…whose breadth and depth of knowledge is unrivalled.” In recent years, on two separate occasions, he has been employed by ICI (Dulux) and The Little Greene to develop ranges of traditional paint colours for English Heritage. Colour ranges have also been produced for the French and German markets. The colours traditionally employed on the exteriors of buildings in Bath, Edinburgh, Penzance and in Gloucester have been investigated for the local planning authorities and guidelines produced for them. The colours used on the exteriors of Chelsea houses in the 19th century have also been identified and an article published for the Chelsea Society. He has recently finished work on a range of exterior colours based on regional use in France. A similar project looking at regional colour in the United Kingdom is in progress.
In 2007 His company, Papers and Paints, was awarded a Royal Warrant for his work with colour.
Personal life.
He is married with a daughter and two sons.
Patrick Baty is the great grandson of the artists Robert Bevan and Stanisława de Karłowska. Sir Philip Hendy, Director of the National Gallery (1946–1967), commented that Bevan was perhaps the first Englishman to use pure colour in the 20th Century.
Lecturing and Writing.
Baty lectures often on the general subject of paint and colour of the 18th and 19th centuries. The audiences range widely from the staff of the national amenity organisations, to preservation enthusiasts. He has been a frequent lecturer on graduate and postgraduate courses at several universities, to architects on Continuing Professional Development courses, and to conservation officers. He has spoken at a number of international symposia in Europe, and lectured and run courses along the East coast of the United States.
His published works are listed here and he has also contributed to and edited various other books on the subject of paint and colour.

<doc id="21539809" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21539809" title="Blackburn Nautilus">
Blackburn Nautilus

The Blackburn 2F.1 Nautilus was a British single-engine two-seat biplane spotter/fighter built in 1929. Only one was completed.
Development.
The company designation, 2F.1, meant that the Nautilus was Blackburn's first two-seat fighter, though it was really intended as a carrier-based fleet spotter with interception capability. It was designed to Air Ministry Specification O.22/26. Though issued in June 1926, this specification did not reach a decision on the final engine to be used until October 1927; prototype contracts were only placed in January 1928, and the four chosen manufacturers did not produce prototypes for trial until 1929. These were the eventual winners, the navalised Hawker Hart first prototype later produced as the Hawker Osprey plus the Fairey Fleetwing, the Short Gurnard and the Blackburn Nautilus. All these were powered by the V-12 water-cooled Rolls-Royce F.XIIMS - later known as the Kestrel IIMS - which produced 525 hp (391 kW) and had a small cross-sectional area.
The slim power unit encouraged the design of slender, well-streamlined fuselages, and the nose of the Nautilus was longer and more pointed even than that of the Ripon III, which used a larger area W-12 Napier Lion engine. The wooden propeller was two-bladed with a diameter of 11 ft (3.35 m). Like most of Blackburn's aircraft of the time, the fuselage was built up around four steel longerons; it was duralumin covered from nose to just aft of the rear observer/gunner's cockpit, the rest fabric covered. The pilot's cockpit was immediately in front of the observer's, under an upper trailing edge cut-out. A braced, rather rectangular tailplane was carried at the top of the fuselage. There was fixed fin surface both above and below the fuselage and the rudder with its horn balance was proud of the upper fin and extended down to the lower part. Both the tailplane incidence and (more unusually) the alignment of the upper part of the fin could be adjusted in flight via trimming wheels. The robust undercarriage was a broad, split-axle type with main wheels fitted with disc brakes. As a seaplane, it could be fitted either with a two-float arrangement or with a single central float, the latter intended to give a better field of view to the observer.
The slim fuselage of the Nautilus did not have its keel aligned with the lower wing, as on most biplanes; rather, the centre line was at mid gap. Blackburn used the gap between keel and wing to insert a faired radiator with a shutter-controlled front intake. This rather enhanced the Nautilus' pointed appearance. The wings were of two-bay construction with parallel struts, staggered and swept. Only the lower wing had dihedral. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The wings were foldable for carrier storage.
Operational history.
The Nautilus was first flown at Brough Aerodrome in May 1929, by T. Neville Stack and testing lead to some changes to the radiator and elevators. It went on to flight trials at RAF Martlesham Heath that August. With the Gurnard eliminated, the other competitors with the Nautilus went to sea on in January 1930. Unsuccessful in the trials, the Nautilus was remodelled as a ship to shore communicator after removal of the Scarff ring from the rear seat. In 1931, it went back to Martlesham and was used for a couple of years as a cross country communications aircraft.

Gordon "Gymie" McMillan (born c. 1927) is a former ice hockey player who was a member of the Michigan Wolverines team that won the first NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey championship in 1948. He played four years of hockey at Michigan from 1946-1949 and broke the school's scoring record with 210 career points.
Moose Jaw Monarchs.
McMillan grew up in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where he played center for the Moose Jaw Monarchs. In April 1945, the Monarchs traveled to Lethbridge, Alberta to play the Lethbridge Native Sons for the western Canada juvenile hockey championship. McMillan, described as the team's "star centre" and a "starry redhead who is the mainspring of the Moose Jaw attack," was left behind in Moose Jaw because his father was seriously ill. However, he arrived in Lethbridge by plane on the morning of the first game, and scored four goals and an assist, as his heads-up hockey and "fast break-aways kept the crowd in a dither." The Monarchs won the series in two games, and McMillan was the high scorer with six goals and an assist. One month after the championship, McMillan's 42-year-old father, a hockey coach who had been recently discharged from the Royal Canadian Air Force, died in Moose Jaw.
University of Michigan.
In the fall of 1945, McMillan enrolled at the University of Michigan to play hockey for Wolverines' coach Vic Heyliger. McMillan played four years of hockey at Michigan, from 1946-1949, and was the team's leading scorer all four years. As a freshman in January 1946, McMillan and teammate Wally Grant both scored hat tricks in a game against McMaster University from Hamilton, Ontario.
As a junior in 1948, McMillan broke Michigan's all-time scoring record, which had been set by the team's coach, Vic Heyliger, with 116 points. McMillan, who would exceed the record by nearly 100 points by the time he was finished, broke the record with Heyliger on the bench as coach in a February 1948 game against Michigan Tech; McMillan earned six points on four goals and two assists in the game. The 1948 team led by McMillan, Wally Grant, Wally Gacek and Al Renfrew won the first NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey championship. Four teams were selected to play in the first NCAA ice hockey championship, held at the Broadmoor Hotel Ice Palace in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The four teams to play in the inaugural Frozen Four were Michigan, Boston College, Dartmouth and Colorado College. In the championship game against Dartmouth, McMillan scored two goals, as Michigan won 8-4. McMillan and teammate Wally Gacek scored goals five seconds apart in the third period against Dartmouth, which remains a record for the fastest consecutive goals in the championship round. The hockey title capped off a year in which Michigan had also won the Rose Bowl and the conference basketball championship.
As a senior in 1949, McMillan had career highs with 36 assists and 60 points. (His career-high in goals was 30 in 1948.) Though Michigan did not repeat as NCAA champions in 1949, they did advance to the Frozen Four. They were beaten by Dartmouth 4-2 in a semi-final game. In his final game in a Michigan jersey, the Frozen Four consolation game in March 1949, McMillan scored a hat trick, earning five points on three goals and two assists.
McMillan's four-year scoring record at Michigan was as follows:
Professional hockey.
McMillan played professional hockey briefly in the 1949-1950 season for the Ryan-Sarnia-Hettche team in the International Hockey League. He played in 12 games and scored 3 goals and 6 assists.

Arizona Robbins

Arizona Robbins, M.D. is a fictional character on the ABC television series "Grey's Anatomy", portrayed by Jessica Capshaw. She was introduced in the show's fifth season as an attending surgeon and the new chief of pediatric surgery. Originally contracted to appear in three episodes, Capshaw's contract was extended to the remainder of the fifth season, with her becoming a series regular in the sixth season.
Robbins has been characterized as "quirky", and is well known for wearing roller skates and a Holly Hobbie pink scrub cap, designed to appeal to her younger patients. She was established as a love-interest for orthopedic resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Series creator Shonda Rhimes was in contrast pleased with the chemistry between Robbins and Torres, citing the addition of Capshaw to the cast as an element of the season of which she was most proud. Initial media reaction to the character was positive. Matt Mitovich of "TV Guide" described her as a "fan favorite", and Chris Monfette for IGN praised the addition of "fresh, new characters", such as Robbins over the course of the season.
Storylines.
Following the death of Dr. Jordan Kenley (John Sloman), Chief Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) replaces his head of pediatric surgery with Dr. Arizona Robbins, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Robbins has a romantic interest in orthopedic attending Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and kisses her. The two embark on a relationship, but when Torres' father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), learns of the relationship, he threatens to cut her off financially unless she returns home with him. When Torres' father returns to Seattle and continues to reject his daughter's sexuality, Robbins is able to convince him to reconsider. She tells Mr. Torres that her father was able to accept her own sexuality, as she promised him she was still the "good man in a storm" he raised her to be, and that Torres is still the same person he raised. Torres is dismayed to learn that Robbins doesn't want children, and the two come to a conclusion that they cannot continue their relationship, since they both want different things. However after a shooter enters Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), they are in lockdown together, and the two reconcile.
Robbins receives word that she has been given a grant to go to Malawi, and become a doctor there. In the end, Torres is shown to have accepted this as well and has decided to leave with Robbins. However, a fight at the airport results in Robbins leaving for Malawi without Torres, ending their relationship. She returns, hoping to rekindle her relationship with Torres, but is initially rejected. Eventually, Torres reveals that she is pregnant with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s baby. Robbins accepts the situation, and she and Torres restart their relationship. Torres gifts Robbins with a weekend getaway, and Robbins proposes to Torres. After proposing, the two get in a car crash leaving Torres in critical condition. A series of surgeries follows, including the delivery of her premature baby, along with emotional breakdowns of both Sloan and Robbins. Upon the awakening of Torres, she accepts her marriage proposal, and the two are married by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). As the fifth year residents are coming close to the end of their residency, Robbins urges Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) to work under her, and is hurt badly in a plane crash, resulting in her left leg being amputated. In the aftermath of the plane accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey, the hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim including Shepherd, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), and herself must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. Those doctors and Callie buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Robbins is initially cold towards Callie because she was the one who decided for an amputation but they slowly reconcile as Robbins tries to adapt to her new life. Afterwards, when a new doctor Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton) arrives to the hospital to reconstruct the face of baby, Robbins feels attracted to her and has a one-night-stand with her. This effectively puts both Robbins and Torres on bad terms as they both let out their true feelings about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt.
After finding out that Arizona cheating on her with Lauren, Callie kicked Arizona out of their apartment. Callie initially agreed to couples therapy, but she showed up at the office only to tell Arizona that she wasn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for some laughs while Callie is at the fundraiser telling people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together when all they did was have a dance party and made grilled cheese sandwiches and watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cut ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. Callie and Arizona are currently working on their relationship. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she'd developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing, if something goes poorly, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position, so they agreed to postpone their plans to have another baby.However in the season finale of season 10 slight implications have been that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate.
Development.
Casting and creation.
It was first reported in December 2008 that Capshaw would be joining the cast of "Grey's Anatomy" as pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins, for a multi-episode arc. Initially scheduled to appear in three episodes of the show's fifth season, series creator Shonda Rhimes later extended Capshaw's contract to appear in all of the season's remaining episodes, becoming a series regular in the sixth season. Speaking of the new addition, Rhimes said:
This promotion saw Robbins become the only lesbian series regular on primetime TV. Robbins is described as "quirky perky" by "TV Guide" Matt Mitovich, and "a clear and rational surgeon who is not ruled by her emotions" by Kris De Leon of "BuddyTV". William Harper, writer of the episode "Beat Your Heart Out" in which Robbins and Torres kiss for the first time, has deemed Robbins: "genuinely, positively interested in people, in the most selfless way." Commenting on Robbins' confidence, Capshaw commented: "she never thinks she's wrong and you don't hate her for it. There's no ego though, she just always thinks she's right and she is." She is portrayed as having "wacky tendencies", including wearing roller shoes to work.
Characterization.
The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Robbins as "confident", "ambitious", and "cheerful". Shortly after her arrival in the show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The relationship between the two is referred to by fans by the portmanteau "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of "Grey's Anatomy" in 2008, due to a lack of chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: "They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them." Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that she wished she could have found Callie a love interest that "sparkled" sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins. 
When Robbins turned Torres down in the episode "An Honest Mistake" due to her inexperience with women, series writer Peter Nowalk offered the insight:
Although the characters go on to begin a relationship, the show's one-hundredth episode "What a Difference a Day Makes" sees them experience difficulties as a result of Torres' father rejecting her for her sexuality. Rhimes commented on their ultimate reconciliation: "I love with Arizona. [... I like that they make me feel hopeful about love." Rhimes has said of their relationship in the sixth season: "I would like to see Callie happily in a long-term relationship. We have so much to explore with them, because we barely know anything about ." Capshaw has characterized the relationship as "incredibly understanding and compassionate and sensitive". She described the sixth season as being about: "cementing a very mature and grounded relationship and taking it forward. This is a drama, of course; there will be conflict, but for the time being, they're enjoying being in a relationship that seems stable." 
Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: "There's probably a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're going to get married just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing."
Reception.
Robbins ranked seventh in a top ten list of gay characters on TV compiled by Jane Boursaw of TV Squad. Boursaw wrote: "She's a mix of ironies - a pediatrician who glides around the hospital on wheelies, impulsively kisses Callie, then tells her she doesn't have time to teach a newbie how to be gay. Still, she's more interesting than the other gays on this show, which are dwindling in numbers since Erica left for parts unknown." Commenting on Hahn's abrupt departure from the show, Dorothy Snarker, writing for LGBT website AfterEllen.com observed of Robbins and Torres' relationship: "I [...] can't help but be wary of how the "Grey's" writers will handle this relationship. Jessica has proven lovely and likable in her brief screen time so far. But it's not how the romance starts, but what happens next that really matters." AfterEllen.com also included Robbins in their poll of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 3 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters, placing her at No. 2.
Matt Mitovich of "TV Guide" noted that Robbins "quickly established herself as a fan favorite", describing her as: "a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace." Chris Monfette for IGN has opinionated that the fifth season of "Grey's Anatomy" was an improvement on the previous two seasons, attributing this in part to the introduction of "fresh, new characters" Robbins and Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Monfette wrote that Arizona's ultimate contribution to the season was "introducing the element of childcare to Seattle Grace", which in turn gave Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) "a great arc". Jennifer Godwin for E! Online approved of Arizona's season six promotion to a series regular, particularly as it meant the continuation of her relationship with Callie.
The "Los Angeles Times" Carina MacKenzie wrote of the sixth season episode "Invasion": "By far the best moment in this episode was Robbins' scene with Torres' father, Carlos. Jessica Capshaw has an incredible ability to take even the most melodramatic of "Grey's" speeches and deliver them with a subtlety and an honesty that makes them come off as sincere instead of overwrought. "I was named for a battleship," she said, and in the powerful monologue that followed, she calmly and carefully explained that Torres was still the woman Carlos raised.

Overnight market

The overnight market is the component of the money market involving the shortest term loan. Lenders agree to lend borrowers funds only "overnight" i.e. the borrower must repay the borrowed funds plus interest at the start of business the next day. Given the short period of the loan, the interest rate charged in the overnight market, known as the overnight rate is, generally speaking, the lowest rate at which banks lend money.
Most of the activity in the so-called overnight market in fact occurs in the morning immediately after the start of business for the day. The typical day at a cash management group for a deposit-taking financial institution begins with forecasting the institution's clients' liquidity needs over the course of that day. If this projection is that the institutions' clients will need more money over the course of the day than the institution has on hand, the institution will borrow money on the overnight market that day. On the other hand, if the analyst projects that the institution will have surplus money on hand beyond that needed by its clients that day, then it will lend money on the overnight market that day.
The bulk of trading occurs in the morning and is based on these projections. If, however, over the course of the day, the actual amount of money required by the institution's clients departs from that projected in the morning, it may become necessary for the institution to borrow money on the overnight market to meet this unexpected demand from its clients; conversely, if the institution finds itself with more funds on hand than it anticipated late in the day, it will then lend those funds on the overnight market. 
The overnight rate fluctuates over the course of a business day, depending on the amount of money demanded from and supplied to the overnight market over the course of the day. The rate quoted as the "overnight rate" may be the rate at the end of the day, or an average of the rate over the course of the day. 
Banks are the largest participant in the overnight market, although some other large financial institutions, e.g. mutual funds, also buy and sell on the overnight market as a way to manage unanticipated cash needs or as a temporary haven for money until the institution can decide on where to invest that money.

Chamaelirium

Chamaelirium is a genus of flowering plants containing the single species Chamaelirium luteum, commonly known as Blazing-Star, Devil's Bit, False Unicorn, Fairy Wand, and Helonias root . It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It can be found in a variety of habitats, including wet meadows and deciduous woodlands. 
"Chamaelirium luteum" has a basal rosette of around six 8–15 cm leaves, from which a single spike-like raceme inflorescence (1–1.5 cm diameter, 8–30 cm length) emerges. The plants are generally dioecious, with male-biased gender ratios in a given population. This is due to higher mortality of female plants, and the tendency of female plants to flower less frequently. Female stalks tend to be taller, giving a total maximum plant height of about 1.2 m, but also tend to have about ten times fewer flowers. 
"C. luteum" is the only member of its monotypic genus, and is quite rare at the fringes of its range.
"C. luteum" is used as ornamental or medical plant. The root contains high valuable substances, which have already been used as medicine by native Americans a long time ago.
Distribution.
"Chamaelirium luteum" can be found in temperate North America, USA and Canada. It occurs in the east of the Mississippi and it is historically known from southern Ontario.
Etymology.
The etymology of "Chamaelirium luteum" comes from the Greek and means: Chamai = "on the ground", leirion = "lilly", lutes = "yellow" 
Cultivation.
Because "Chamaelirium luteum" is normally collected wild, it is at risk of extinction. Cultivation techniques are still under development to satisfy the demand from the market.
Site selection.
"Chamaelirium luteum" prefers moist, well drained and acidic soil (pH: 4.5 - 6) with a high humus content. In open fields it should be shaded by a shading structure, to protect it from the direct radiation of the sun. For forest cultivation it should be preferably planted in an area with tall hardwood trees.
Planting.
"Chamaelirium luteum" can be propagated through seeds or root division. 
For propagation through root division the rhizomes can be divided by cutting them into pieces of 1/4 inch (6mm). This disc-shaped pieces should be left to callus over night and can be planted in pots on the next day. The soil should be kept moist and shaded until the plants emerge. Young plants can be transplanted in a well prepared growing bed with a high organic matter in a planting distance of 6-10 inch (15–25 cm). To support the plants with nutrients, pine needles, rotted conifer-derived sawdust or bark mulch should be added to the top soil. 
For propagation through seeds, the seeds should be sown in late Fall or early Winter to a depth of 1/8 inch (3 mm) in breeding beds with high humus content. For a good germination the seed should go through stratification. The plants grow best in soil mixture of peat moss and decomposed pine needles. When the young plants emerge they should be left in undisturbed at least for one growing season. Then they can be transplanted as for the propagation method through root division.
Maintenance.
The plant should be moist and shaded and protected from herbivory by snails and slugs or deer in woods. Weeds should always be removed.
Harvesting.
The plants are ready for harvest after a growing time of six years. Only the rhizomes are used as crop. Collecting them occurs by digging the rhizome out with a garden fork or a small dinging tool. This should be done in Fall after collecting the mature seeds.
After removing the soil and the roots from other plants, the rhizome should be stored unwashed until the further processing. It should be prevented from drying out and also from too high moisture, which could lead to mold infestation. Before processing, the rhizome should be washed carefully.
Processing.
1. Step: Drying the clean root in a warm places with adequate airflow. The drying process should be conduct carefully. The root should be dried on the first day with low temperature of 70°F (20°C) and high air flow. 
2. Step: Dried the root thoroughly with a higher temperature up to 100°F (35°C). Once it is completely dry, it can be stored in a cool, dark and dry location for up to three years.
3. Step: Milling the dried root with a mill or by a kitchen blender.
Uses.
"C. luteum" is used as ornamental or medical herb. Historically it has been used by the Natives of America. It has the reputation, to have been one of the most widely used in North America. 
It was traditionally used to prevent miscarriages and it has the reputation of improving fertility.
Nowadays it is used to treat different problems as menstrual problems, pregnancy complaints, fertility issues, ovarian cysts
and diuretic 
Bioactive components.
The bioactive components are a mixture of steroidal saponins, including chamaelirin and aglycone diosgenin. These bioactive substances act as an emmenagogue, diuretic and emetic.

Rhina, Hesse

Rhina is a village in eastern Hesse, Germany, belonging to the Haunetal municipality within the district of Hersfeld-Rotenburg. In 2004, the population of Rhina consisted of 509 residents.
History.
The village was first mentioned in documents in 1003. However, the first traces of humans in the area are from the early Paleolithic Era and Middle Stone Age from the years 10000 to 6000BC. Settlement during the Middle Ages occurred mainly in the area around the German abbey at Fulda, although sovereignty over the area would be widely established by German knights. From the late Middle Ages on, the families from Trubenbach (today Truembach), Bimbach, Buchenau, and Haune in Rhina were considerably wealthy. In the 15th century, the Landgraviate of Hesse succeeded in acquiring rights to the estate of Rhina. During the time of the Reformation, this led to violent conflicts between Hesse and the noble families over rights to the village.
The church of Rhina was originally consecrated in the name of St. Nicholas. In 1529 and 1530, it was reformed. During the Reformation, the local production of pottery developed in the village. The first evidence of the presence of Jews in the village is documented from 1631 during the Thirty Years War. From the 18th century especially, the Jewish community grew at a regular rate, the first synagogue being erected in 1782. In 1806, Rhina came under the rule of the Kingdom of Westphalia. The neighboring village of Werdha was the seat of the nobility and Rhina belonged to the canton of Holzheim. The church of Rhina was re-built in 1814. In 1821, Rhina was incorporated into the Hünfeld district of the Hessian province of Fulda. Rhina's synagogue was rebuilt from 1831 to 1832. In 1835, the first village-wide local elections were held. A Jewish cemetery was created in 1837. The residents of the villages of Wehrda, Rhina, Schletzenrod, and Wetzlos rebelled against the noble lordship of the region in the Revolution of 1848. In the course of the conflict, attacks were also carried out against Rhina's Jews. In 1862, following a great increase in the Jewish population of Rhinda, a Jewish grade school was opened. Rhina received its first telephone in 1902, and in 1912 developed water and plumbing infrastructure. In 1933, following an order by the NSDAP district leadership as well as the office of the regional administration, the Jewish members of the municipal council were forced to resign from their posts. From 1934, assaults on Jewish property and against those of Jewish faith began to occur. In 1935, those attending the synagogue were beaten up. In 1937, a catastrophic storm befell the village. On the 10th of November, 1938, Rhina's large, integrated Jewish school was burnt to the ground. Rhina's mayor declared the village "judenfrei" (free of Jews) on March 1, 1939. 49 people were deported by train to ghettos and murdered in death camps. Beginning in 1949, reparations were made to surviving Jews and to the JRSO (Jewish Restitution Successor Organization) within the American occupation zone. In 1965, a village community center was dedicated on the former site of Rhina's synagogue. Rhina was greatly affected by floods after an overflowing of the Haune River in 1966. In 1971, within the framework of a redistricting act in Hesse, Rhina was incorporated into the community of Haunetal.

Hillingdon Cycle Circuit

Hillingdon Cycle Circuit is a purpose-built road cycling circuit situated in Minet Country Park, Hayes in West London. The 0.93 mile long, 6 metre wide circuit is used for year-round racing, training and leisure riding.
History.
Chas Messenger, the local British Cycling Facilities Officer, organised cycle racing on the unopened Hayes Bypass for several years in the 1990s. Triple Olympic champion and Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins started his racing career on this prototype circuit as a schoolboy.
Once the bypass opened to traffic, Messenger and Bill Bannister began searching for another closed road circuit in the area. After some abortive suggestions had been investigated, Minet Park emerged as a possible solution. What is now the park had been used to dump waste earth from the construction of the bypass. The area was, however, zoned for sports activities and community use.
Paul Barker, a member of the Westerley Cycling Club and a London Borough of Hillingdon councillor was a key figure in steering plans for the circuit to a successful completion.
The circuit was designed by Don Wiseman as a fast, easy to ride course: it is possible to pedal all the way round the circuit's corners. The circuit opened to riders in 1997.
The early circuit headquarters were temporary huts. There are now permanent storage facilities (part funded by the Kenton Road Club) and in 2010 a clubhouse was opened beside the track with meeting and catering facilities and a classroom. 
Barker suggested to local cycling coaches Brian Wright and Ray Kelly that a children's club be started. The Prime Coaching organisation, together with others and the parents of the children created and developed the Hillingdon Slipstreamers. The group still meet at the circuit every Saturday morning. Bradley Wiggins is now the Slipstreamers' president.
Usage.
The circuit is used regularly for racing and hosts an annual round of the national circuit race championship. There is a regular Winter series running from December to February. During the season there are races on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings and most weekends.
There are formal and informal training sessions three or four days per week.
A women only leisure cycling group meet at the circuit on Friday afternoons.
Duathlon events are run on the circuit on selected Mondays from April to August.
The circuit is also used by the London Region Nordic Ski Club, for roller skiing events, for Human Powered Vehicle races, and for charity fun rides.

Chaldia

Chaldia (, "Khaldia") was a historical region located in mountainous interior of the eastern Black Sea, northeast Anatolia (modern Turkey). Its name was derived from a people called the "Chaldoi" (or "Chalybes") that inhabited the region in Antiquity. Chaldia was used throughout the Byzantine period and was established as a formal theme, known as the Theme of Chaldia (Greek: θέμα Χαλδίας), by 840. During the late Middle Ages, it formed the core of the Empire of Trebizond until its fall to the Ottomans in 1461.
Anthony Bryer traces the origin of its name not to Chaldea, as Constantine VII had done, but to the Urartian language, for whose speakers Ḫaldi was the Sun God. Bryer notes at the time of his writing that a number of villages in the Of district were still known as "Halt".
Geography.
Initially, the name Chaldia was consigned to the highland region around Gümüşhane, in northeast Anatolia but in middle Byzantine period, the name was extended to include the coastal areas, and thus the entire province around Trapezus (Trebizond, modern Trabzon). Forming the easternmost area of the Pontic Alps, Chaldia was bounded to the north by the Black Sea, to the east by Lazica, the westernmost part of Caucasian Iberia, to the south by Erzinjan, Erzurum and what the Romans and Byzantines called Armenia Minor, and to the west by the western half of Pontus. Its main cities were the two ancient Greek colonies, Kerasus (modern Giresun) and Trapezus, situated in the coastal lowlands. The mountainous interior to the south, known as "Mesochaldia" ("Middle Chaldia"), was more sparsely inhabited and described by the 6th-century historian Procopius as "inaccessible", but rich in mineral deposits, especially lead, but also silver and gold. The mines of the region gave the name "Argyropolis" ("silver town", modern Gümüşhane) to the principal settlement .
History.
The first local inhabitants, the "Chalybes", were counted among the earliest ironsmith nations by Classical writers. Indeed, the Greek name for steel is "chalybas" (Greek: χάλυβας), possibly deriving from them. The first Greek colony was that of Trapezus, founded by Greek traders from Miletus, traditionally dated to 756 BC. Greek colonization was restricted to the coast, and in later ages Roman control remained likewise only nominal over the tribes of the interior. 
The coastal regions, however, belonged to the Roman province of "Pontus Polemoniacus". Only during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) were the warlike tribes, the "Sannoi" or "Tzannoi", subdued, Christianized, and brought under central rule. Justinian included the entire region in the newly constituted province of "Armenia I Magna" with Trapezus as its capital (under Emperor Maurice, it was renamed "Armenia III"). 
In the second half of the 7th century, with the establishment of the theme system, the region (Pontus Polemoniacus with the portion of Armenia I known as Keltzene) became part of the Armeniac Theme, initially as the "tourma" (division) of Chaldia, and later as a semi-distinct duchy ("doukaton") or archontate. By 840, and perhaps as early as 824, it was constituted as a theme in its own right. Arab geographers of the 9th and 10th centuries report differently on the theme: Ibn Khordadbeh reports that it counted six fortified places, Qudama ibn Ja'far that its troops numbered 4,000, while Ibn al-Faqih writes that its governing "strategos" commanded 10,000 men (certainly exaggerated) and had tow subordinate "tourmarchai". According to 10th-century documents, the "strategos" of Chaldia received twenty pounds of gold as an annual salary, of which half was paid by the state treasury and the rest came from the tax proceeds of his province, including the "kommerkion" tax on the important trade routes from the East that converged on Trapezus. In the early 10th century, the theme's southern portion, the district of Keltzene, was detached and added to the newly established theme of Mesopotamia.
Until the eastern gains in the latter 10th century, Chaldia remained the northeastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire. During the periods 1091/1095–1098 and 1126–1140, the theme was practically autonomous from the Byzantine government. During the first period, under its "doux", Theodore Gabras, the region had been cut off from the remaining Byzantine territories by the Seljuk Turks, while during the second period, "doux" Constantine Gabras had rebelled against Emperor John II Komnenos. Following the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the region became part of the new Empire of Trebizond. Indeed, by the 14th century, the Empire was reduced practically to the territory of the old theme. The Empire of Trebizond managed to survive through successive upheavals by a combination of its inaccessible location, a small but capable army, and a sound diplomacy based on marriage alliances, before finally falling to the Ottomans in 1461. Even thereafter, isolated fortresses in the interior continued to resist. Only in 1479 was the region subdued, when the castle of Golacha, the last remaining Christian stronghold in Asia Minor, fell. Significant numbers of Pontic Greeks remained in the region throughout the Ottoman period, until the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Van Trump Creek

Van Trump Creek, also called Van Trump Falls Creek or the Van Trump Fork of the Nisqually River, is a creek in Pierce County, Washington. It is a tributary of the Nisqually River, joining the river just above the mouth of the Paradise River. The creek is known for having several well known waterfalls along its course.
Course.
The creek originates at the toe of the Van Trump Glacier and flows south. Just west of Mildred Point, the creek drops over small Upper Comet Falls. Shortly below that, the creek drops over the largest and best known of the falls on the creek, Comet Falls. Shortly below Comet Falls, Falls Creek joins Van Trump Creek. The creek drops over another major waterfall just below the mouth of Falls Creek, Van Trump Falls. After dropping over the falls, the creek enters a deep canyon, which extends almost all the way to its mouth. About halfway through the gorge, the creek drops over dangerous-to-access Lower Van Trump Falls before exiting the canyon by dropping over majorly altered Christine Falls. The creek then continues south to where it meets the Nisqually.
Debris Flows of 2001.
On August 14, 2001, a ton of debris washed down from the Kautz Glacier and flowed down the creek, turning the creek into a raging torrent of mud and other debris. Amazingly, most of the waterfalls on the creek were not majorly harmed. The mudflows took out the bridge above Comet Falls and even today the bridge is still out. The mudflows scoured the creeks banks clean of any plant life and replaced it with dead vegetation.
Floods of 2003 and 2006.
In 2003 and 2006, Van Trump Creek and Falls Creek experienced major floods. The floods brought huge amounts of water down, large enough to take out all the dead vegetation, left by the 2001 mudflows, lining the creek in many places and replace them with gigantic boulders in some areas, especially below Upper Comet Falls. It altered several of the falls on the creek.

Edith Collier

Edith Marion Collier (28 March 1885 – 12 December 1964) was an early modern painter from New Zealand. She came from Wanganui. Her work is largely unknown at home and overseas.
Edith Collier's contribution to New Zealand art as an innovator, modernist and expatriate painter placed her in a most distinguished group, but her achievements have been eclipsed by the very company she kept - such as Frances Hodgkins and Margaret Preston.
After a thorough although conservative art education at the Technical School in Wanganui, Edith Collier left New Zealand in 1913 for St John's Wood Art School in London. She was then aged 27. Rapidly disillusioned, and feeling marginalised as an expatriate woman painter, she became more influenced by other expatriates in London, and was to enjoy greater success through exhibiting with the Society of Women Artists and Women's International Art Club - venues outside the art establishment - and became a significant Modernist painter.
Collier returned to New Zealand in 1922 as an experienced artist with innovative ideas, but as a spinster in provincial Wanganui received harsh treatment, including what Drayton describes as savage, critical assessment and negative response from her own community. In a well-known incident her father burned many of her best paintings, including her nudes. She died in 1964.

<doc id="21540218" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21540218" title="Citizens' Alliance">
Citizens' Alliance

Citizens' Alliances were state and local anti-trade union organizations prominent in the United States of America during the first decade of the 20th century. The Citizen's Alliances were closely related to employers' associations but allowed participation of a broad range of sympathetic citizens in addition to those employers apt to be affected by strikes. Originating in the American state of Ohio as the "Modern Order of Bees," the Citizens' Alliance movement spread westwards, playing a particularly important role in labor relations in the states of Colorado and California. Citizens' Alliance groups often worked in tandem with smaller but better financed employers' organizations interested in establishing or maintaining open shop labor conditions, including the Mine Owners' Associations (MOA) or the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
Organizational history.
General outline.
The Citizens' Alliance movement originated in Dayton, Ohio circa 1900 as a secret society called the "Modern Order of Bees," also known colloquially as the "Hooly-Goolies." The group was viewed as an adjunct of a local employers' association, with membership open not only to the narrow circle of employers, but also to any citizen who was not a member of a trade union.
The term "Citizens' Alliance" was adopted from the name of a political organization established more than a decade earlier. The populist National Citizens' Industrial Alliance of 1891 sought to bolster the rights of working people; the employers' Citizens' Alliance of 1903 sought to curtail union power.
If the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) represented the large industrialists, the Citizens' Alliance groups were composed of smaller local associations. These entities were united in the belief that organized labor was "evil and un-American." 
Within three years it was perceived that the "educational campaigns" of the NAM and the CIA had reversed public opinion and ended the growth of unionism. At the 1906 CIA convention Charles W. Post, the breakfast cereal manufacturer, declared that,
"Two years ago the press and pulpit were delivering platitudes about the oppression of the working man. Now this has all been changed since it has been discovered that the enormous Labor Trust is the heaviest oppressor of the independent workingman as well as the common American Citizen."
Methods.
Citizens' Alliance groups also sometimes conducted boycotts in an attempt to isolate and influence employers who sought labor peace through the recognition of unions and collective bargaining. By way of example, in May 1903 representatives of the Denver Citizens' Alliance and the local manufacturer's association conducted an organized campaign to visit local employers with unionized work-forces in order to force them to abrogate their labor contracts. Deadlines were issued and boycotts threatened to be visited upon those firms failing to heed to Citizens' Alliance's warnings.
Such hardball tactics drew condemnation in the local press, with the "Denver Post" opining:
"The Citizens' Alliance and the employers' association have adopted one of the very methods of unionism that they condemn so vehemently — the submit or be destroyed method — to bring offending employers in line. They certainly can no longer wonder where laboring men get their ideas for pushing strikes and boycotts. If these steps had been taken by unions, all the better class, so-called, in the city would be loud in denouncing them."
Boycotts imposed by local Citizens' Alliance groups hit both sides of the production chain, including both organized refusals to sell components to and organized refusals to buy finished products from subject firms.
National organization.
The various locally-organized Citizens' Alliances and employers' associations were joined into a unified national organization by a convention held in October 1903 in Chicago, which launched the Citizens' Industrial Association of America.
State-level activities.
Colorado.
Denver.
James C. Craig became president of the Citizens' Alliance of Denver, which enrolled nearly 3,000 individual and corporate members within three weeks after its creation. It had a war chest of nearly $20,000. The organization had a "clandestine character", and all the inner workings of the organization were enshrouded "in deep secrecy", raising the possibility that "the group might take extralegal action against all organized labor." 
Membership was restricted to persons, firms, associations, or corporations owning property, or engaged in business in Colorado, with members of labor organizations specifically excluded. Local Citizens' Alliance organizations throughout Colorado made up the Colorado Citizens' Alliance, which formed a close partnership with the Mine Owners' Association and with the Colorado National Guard. Together, these groups engaged in widespread extra-legal activities in the Cripple Creek gold mining district, where the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) had declared a strike. The Colorado Citizens' Alliance:
"...claimed its purpose was for protection and to resist the unlawful demands of the unions, with 'unlawful' meaning anything the unions requested. The thinly veiled objective was the eradication of the Miners' Union and, on the state level, the obliteration of the entire WFM."
Telluride.
During the 1903 strike in Telluride, the San Miguel County Citizens' Alliance circulated a petition accusing union leaders of the murder of William J. Barney, an out-of-town worker who had walked away from his job as a mine guard after only a week. A grand jury had concluded there was no evidence a crime had been committed, but members of the Alliance ignored that conclusion. When the alleged victim appeared in court seeking a divorce one year after he'd disappeared, at least two Alliance members discovered he was still alive. That knowledge didn't serve their purpose so they ignored it.
Accusations that the strikers were a threat to mines, mills, power stations, reservoirs, train trestles, power lines, and trams were used to justify occupation by the national guard. The real purpose was protection of strikebreakers. The Citizens' Alliance helped to decide who was arrested and who walked free, and union sympathies were the determining factor. Some union arrestees were brutally treated, with pistol blows to the head and rifle blows to the body. But generally, union men in Telluride were too well-behaved, and new criminal offenses had to be invented. For example, men simply standing together were guilty of conspiracy. "Offensive carriage" became a crime when union men "disturbed the peace and quiet" by the way they stood and walked. Undercover Pinkerton spy George W. Riddell was arrested on such a charge with a group of strikers and determined during incarceration, perhaps to no one's real surprise, that the miners had no plans of the sort with which they'd been accused.
The Alliance in Telluride advertised that there was no strike, and, with the militia, they "acted as a fortified employment agency for the mines." Meanwhile, union miners could have pockets stuffed with money, but were still found guilty of vagrancy and expelled. Finally, the Citizens' Alliance in Telluride acted as a vigilante mob, issuing itself national guard rifles and rounding up the remaining sixty-five union men and supporters late on an icy night. Some of the detainees were without shoes and shirt, most without coats or hats. About fourteen of them were injured, at least one was robbed, and all were forced out of town.
Cripple Creek.
In Cripple Creek the Citizens' Alliance organizations of Colorado willingly participated in the suspension of the Bill of Rights by the National Guard. To crush the union, its leaders were arrested without cause and either thrown in bullpens, or banished. Prisoners who won habeas corpus cases were released in court and then immediately re-arrested. A local newspaper was placed under military censorship, with all union-friendly information prohibited. Freedom of assembly was not allowed. The right to bear arms was suspended—citizens were required to give up their firearms and their ammunition. Even "loitering or strolling about" was criminalized in an effort to crush the union. After spasms of violence — some of them brutal crimes that were never properly investigated — the Citizens' Alliance and their allies wrecked union halls throughout the district, and looted four union cooperative stores. Ultimately, many died and many families were torn apart in the successful effort to expel the union by force of arms.
The struggle between employers and employees was viewed as a relationship imbued with class interests. Craig declared that one purpose of the Denver Citizens' Alliance was "correcting and preventing pernicious class legislation." And the Cripple Creek District Citizens' Alliance delivered resolutions to the Colorado Governor which starkly expressed their goal of "controlling the lawless classes."
Craig wrote that the Citizens' Alliance movement "has completely counteracted the terror and influence of the boycott, the unlawful and un-American weapon of the unions." In order to accomplish the goal of counteracting union boycotts, the Citizens' Alliance in Colorado used boycotts of its own. In hiring, they arranged for employers to boycott union members. They arranged for the Denver Advertisers' Association to boycott newspapers that expressed disapproval of the Citizens' Alliance and the Mine Owners' Association. They arranged for Cripple Creek newspapers to refuse to advertise the store of the Interstate Mercantile Company, which had bought out the stock of goods in a Western Federation of Miners store that had been ransacked by a mob.
California.
San Francisco.
The year 1900 saw dramatic growth of trade unionism in San Francisco, then the largest city in the state of California. By the middle of that year the California Bureau of Labor Statistics counted no fewer than 90 trade unions in the city of San Francisco and an additional 24 in neighboring Alameda County on the East side of San Francisco Bay. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated a total union membership of 20,000 for San Francisco — a significant percentage of the city's approximately 340,000 residents — as well as 3,000 more in Oakland and Berkeley of the East Bay. Moreover, while these mid-year figures may have represented something of an overcount due to methodological errors by the BLS, the trade union movement was unquestionably experiencing rapid growth and may well have exceeded these estimates by the end of the year. 
The demands of these growing unions for a shorter working day and higher wages put pressure upon local employers. A series of strikes swept the city, the most bitter of which being a battle between the San Francisco Building Trades Council and Bay Area planing-mill employers attempting to establish the 8-hour day. A newly unified Bakers' Union won a six-day work week, retail clerks unionized and campaigned for 6 pm closings, and unionized electrical workers and longshoremen won wage gains as the result of strike actions. Local garment workers of the Cloakmakers' Union conducted an effective boycott against three local manufacturers, gaining the cooperation of retail stores and maintaining pickets against the involved companies.
Many employers, interested in maintaining the status quo in terms of hours and wages, sought to organize themselves against their increasingly organized workers. This took concrete form in April 1901 when there was established the Employers' Association of San Francisco. This organization maintained strict secrecy as to its size, membership composition, financing, and goals, but it emerged before the public eye in May, when it first attempted to exert organized opposition in San Francisco labor disputes.
The secrecy employed by the Employers' Association created public image of a mysterious and omnipotent force; in reality the group included only a small minority of San Francisco's employers. Those which did participate, however, were among the city's largest and best-financed, and new members were required to post financial guarantees of their observance of the policies advanced by the organization. It was estimated that even by May 1901 a war chest of $150,000 had been amassed for the organized fight against trade unionism — a total which union leaders believed to have doubled or tripled by the end of that first summer. A series of increasingly bitter strikes followed, with labor further pushing the envelope with the establishment of the Union Labor Party that same year, followed by the electoral capture of City Hall.
It was in this context that the Citizens' Alliance movement emerged in California, as a component of the anti-union reaction to growth of organized labor in the state's urban center of San Francisco. The first branch of the Citizens' Alliance was established in the city sometime in the winter of 1903-04. The organization, which worked hand-in-glove with the Employers' Association of San Francisco, was the local reflection of a national campaign on behalf of the open shop and drew active interest and support from the National Association of Manufacturers and other industrial leaders eager to see organized labor's West coast stronghold deconstructed.
At the time of the establishment of San Francisco Citizens' Alliance a critical strategic decision was made: rather than making use of well-connected local employers to staff the organization, professional anti-union functionaries were imported. The organization also made the determination to engage in political action in an attempt to wrench the city administration of San Francisco from the hands of the Union Labor Party. Although not initially clear at the time, these two decisions had the unanticipated effect of increasing the unity of the labor movement and thereby helping to assure a third term of ULP control in the election of 1905.
The San Francisco Citizens' Alliance branch claimed to have a membership of 16,000 in the fall of 1904. As such, it was the largest branch of the organization in the state. Membership in the organization was bolstered by pressure said to have been exerted by employers on their managerial staff to join the group. Additionally, local offices of the Chamber of Commerce made efforts to drum up support for the group among their membership.
Other cities.
In addition to its San Francisco branch, the Citizens' Alliance also maintained local organizations in Los Angeles (purportedly the largest group in the nation relative to size of the city); Stockton and Bakersfield in the Central Valley; Oakland, San Jose, and Palo Alto in the Bay Area; and Fort Bragg on the North Coast.
The Los Angeles Citizens' Alliance branch was notably headed by Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the "Los Angeles Times" and well known as one of the most bitter opponents of organized labor in the state.
Minnesota.
In his book "A Union Against Unions: The Minneapolis Citizens Alliance and Its Fight Against Organized Labor", William Millikan writes that David M. Parry stated "the true nature of the United States business community's drive against union labor" when he addressed the Minneapolis Commercial Club in 1903:
"I believe we should endeavor to strike at the root of the matter, and that is to be found in the wide spread socialistic sentiment among certain classes of people."
Parry later became the first president of the Citizens' Industrial Alliance.
Members of the Commercial Club, Minneapolis business leaders and their supporters who would sponsor the local Citizens' Alliance, responded favorably to the demand, declaring "Law and order must be enforced and...class domination over industry is not going to be tolerated."
In Minnesota, Citizens' Alliance leaders focused on defeating organized labor by establishing anti-union policies and legislation at the city, state, and federal levels. They sought to accomplish this, in part, by helping to incorporate the Minnesota Employers' Association (MEA).
Millikan observes that Parry let slip in a moment of candor what the Minneapolis Citizens' Alliance would seek to keep secret for three decades: this was "a war between the owners of American industry and the working class."
Alabama.
A Citizens' Alliance group was formed in Birmingham, Alabama in August 1903.

Sŏngbul-sa is a Korean Buddhist temple in Sariwŏn, North Hwanghae Province, North Korea. It is located within the castle on Mt. Jŏngbang and was founded in 898 AD. The temple consists of six buildings, some of which are among the oldest wooden buildings in North Korea.
Rebuilt in 1374, this pavilion sits on a raised stone platform and features delicate paintings, cow-tongue eaves, and doors with carved flower grilles. A Koryo period five-story stone pagoda stands in front of it. 
Rebuilt in 1327, Ungjin Shrine is one of the oldest wooden buildings in North Korea. The long, spacious hall sits on a raised platform, and is a paradigm of Koryo architecture.

Korg DW-6000

The Korg DW-6000 is a six note polyphonic hybrid synthesizer with two digital wave cycle waveform oscillators (no samples) and one analogue lowpass filter per voice. Its eight basic waveforms were originally generated through additive synthesis (DWGS in Korg's nomenclature), but there is no facility for editing their harmonic content by the user. 
Patch editing is performed by the typical (for the time) method of selecting a parameter then using a single data slider to increment or decrement the value. Curiously, the factory patch names are written on the front panel, a trait more apt to be found on consumer keyboards rather than professional synthesizers. Another trait that belies the DW-6000's "budget" role, relative to its more capable and expensive fellow Korg unit Korg DW-8000, is the lack of velocity sensitivity or aftertouch capabilities. 
Korg DW-6000 has some killer waveforms making the synth more raw analog than DW-8000.

<doc id="21540285" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21540285" title="The Bodyguard World Tour">
The Bodyguard World Tour

The Bodyguard World Tour was a concert tour by American recording R&B/pop singer Whitney Houston in support of her smash "multi-platinum" album "". It was Houston's fourth world tour and her most extensive. The worldwide tour kicked off on July 5, 1993 in Miami, Florida. Spanning two years, Houston played North America twice, Europe, Japan, and made her first appearances in South America and South Africa.
History.
With the enormous success of "The Bodyguard" movie and soundtrack, Houston went on an extensive world tour to support her projects. The opening date was in Miami on July 5, 1993. Houston received a lot of flak for showing up late and then telling a fan who wanted an autograph to sit down. Houston played five nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and then played six nights at the Sands Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City. Most of the shows during this 1993 US leg were in theaters because Houston wanted an intimate setting. During the US leg, Houston took a break to fly over to Europe to accompany husband Bobby Brown on his tour. Gospel act Angie & Debbie Winans were the opening act for the 1993 US leg. During the second North American leg in 1994, Houston performed at the opening ceremony of the 1994 FIFA World Cup at the Rose Bowl Stadium. During that time, the singer had throat ailments and had to cancel eight shows during that time, all of which were rescheduled a month later. The tour was a big success. Many shows were among the highest grossing shows of their week. The grossings helped Houston make Forbes Magazine's Richest Entertainers list. Houston earned over $33 million during 1993 and 1994, the third highest for a female entertainer.
The show.
During the first North American leg, gospel act Angie and Debbie Winans were the opening acts. Smoothe Sylk was the opening act during the second North American leg. Unlike her previous tour, this tour did not focus as much on the entertainment aspect. Houston borrowed some of then-husband Bobby Brown's own concert dancers for some of the concerts. However, the show was about "The Voice."
As always, the concerts allowed Houston to arrange her material into more informal settings than the original recordings. During her first Radio City performance, Stephen Holden of the "New York Times" wrote that "her stylistic trademarks -- shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration -- infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning." At one of her Atlantic City dates, Kevin L. Carter of the "Philadelphia Inquirer" wrote that Houston handled her songs "with subdued emotionalism and the intelligence that only a gifted musician can bring to a song.
"Saving All My Love for You" was turned into a "smoky saloon-style ballad". Many critics noted that the highlight of the show was when Houston took on "And I Am Telling You" from Dreamgirls, and "I Loves You Porgy" from Porgy and Bess. Stephen Holden wrote of the medley that "her voice conveyed authority, power, determination and just enough vulnerability to give a sense of dramatic intention". As always, Houston included gospel songs. She introduced her band while performing 'Revelation.' Houston spoke about the Lord before going into 'Jesus Loves Me' which was often accompanied with complete silence from the mesmerized crowd." During the last couple of years, since her marriage to Brown, the tabloids generated many stories about Houston and Brown. "The New York Post" created a rumor that the singer had overdosed on diet pills, leading to a lawsuit filed by Houston. During her shows, while performing her love medley, Houston often denied tabloid rumors. Houston often brought her husband and baby to the stage with her to prove that they are a happy family and that the tabloids are wrong. Many critics felt that these tabloid stories helped her sing with more conviction and emotion. According to some critics, Brown's presence made "All the Man That I Need" a more stirring performance leading up the emotional high of "I Have Nothing", while others felt they were unnecessary, cheesy moments. Many critics praised her Aretha Franklin medley that she performed at certain shows. Houston performed "Ain't No Way", "(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman" and "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man". According to Jon Beam of the "Minneapolis Star Tribune", the Aretha Franklin medley was a triumph of substance over style. He wrote that "She seemed a natural instead of a studied singer doing "A Natural Woman," and "Do Right Woman" was a right-on, soulful country-blues song, with a traditional call-and-response between Houston and her backup singers."

1925 Milwaukee Badgers season

The 1925 Milwaukee Badgers season was their fourth in the National Football League. The team failed to improve on their previous league record of 5–8, losing all their games. They tied for sixteenth place in the league.
The end of the Badgers season was centered on a team scandal with the Chicago Cardinals. The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players to play for the Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. When NFL President Joseph Carr learned high school players had been used in a league game, he told reporters the 59–0 Cardinals win would be stricken from the record. However, the league had never got around to removing it and the game is still a part of the NFL records. Cardinals' owner Chris O'Brien was also fined $1,000 by Carr for allowing his team play a game against high schoolers, even though O'Brien claimed that he was unaware of the players' status. Finally Badgers' owner, Ambrose McGuirk, was ordered to sell his Milwaukee franchise within 90 days. Folz, for his role, was barred from football for life.
However by the summer of 1926, the $1,000 fine against O'Brien was rescinded, probably since the amount would have put the Cardinals out of business. McGuirk though had already sold his Badgers franchise to Johnny Bryan, a fullback with the Chicago Bears. Two of the high school football players used in scandal even earned high school all-star recognition at the end of their season. Art Folz reportedly told the high schoolers that the game was a "practice game" and would in no part affect their amateur status.
The scandal did have implications for the 1925 NFL Championship, when the Pottsville Maroons had their title removed by the NFL for playing in an unsanctioned game against the Notre Dame All-Stars. To this day, Pottsville residents and supporters still demand to know why Chicago was awarded the title even though they too were found by Carr to have violated the NFL's rules.

Namdaemun (Kaesong)

The Kaesong Namdaemun is the south gate of the old walled city of Kaesong, North Korea. Constructed between 1391 and 1393, it is the only one of the original seven citadel gates to survive mostly intact into the present. Started at the end of the Koryo period in 1391, it was completed three years later under the succeeding Joseon dynasty. It features a stone base topped by a wooden pavilion; however, the pavilion seen today is a 1954 reconstruction as the original was destroyed in 1950 by American bombing during the Korean War. The gate houses the Yŏnbok Bell (), cast in 1346 and weighing 14 tonnes. Recovered from Yŏnbok Temple when it was destroyed by fire in 1563, the bell was used to call out the hours until the early 20th century.
The gate is one of the National treasures of North Korea.

List of places of worship in Crawley

The borough of Crawley, in West Sussex, England, has 43 churches, chapels and other buildings used specifically for worship. Other religious communities meet in community centres, schools and other buildings whose primary function is secular. Three other former places of worship are no longer used by their original congregation, although only one of these has fallen out of use entirely. The borough covers the New Town of Crawley, whose development began in the late 1940s, and Gatwick Airport—an international airport which has two multi-faith chapels of its own. The New Town absorbed three villages with a long history of Christian worship, and later extensions to the boundary have brought other churches into the borough.
Crawley has a majority Christian population, but it has a much larger proportion of Muslim and Hindu residents than England overall. There are two Hindu temples and a Hindu centre (Swaminarayan Manor), a Sikh gurdwara and three mosques. A Quaker meeting house in the Ifield area is one of the oldest in the world.
Several churches have listed status in view of their architectural and historical importance, but most places of worship date from the postwar era when the New Town was developed, and are of modest architectural merit: Nikolaus Pevsner stated in 1965 that those built up to that time were "either entirely uneventful or more often mannered and contorted, with odd spikes and curvy roofs".
History and development.
Most of the borough's area is covered by Crawley New Town. The area around the villages of Three Bridges, Crawley and Ifield was selected by the British Government as the site for one of the developments proposed in the New Towns Act 1946. The Government set up a Development Corporation, headed by Sir Thomas Bennett, to coordinate the work. Anthony Minoprio designed the plans, and building work started in the late 1940s and continued until the late 1980s. The New Town consisted of self-contained neighbourhoods, each of which had at least one Anglican church. The Development Corporation's intention was for one to be placed at the centre of each neighbourhood, and for churches of other Christian denominations to occupy sites where they could serve a larger area covering several neighbourhoods. This plan was followed as far as practicable. The Corporation provided the freehold of the land on which churches were built at 25% of the price that applied for residential land use.
Two mosques were established in the town in the mid-1980s, and the Ahmadiyya community founded a third in the former Elim Pentecostal church in Langley Green in 2012. A Gurjar Hindu community became established in Crawley in 1968 and opened a mandir (temple) and community centre in a building in West Green in 1998. A new temple in the Ifield area was expected to open in December 2009, but construction was delayed and it opened on 23 May 2010. It is the largest such temple in South East England, at , and also has a community centre, offices, gardens and sports facilities. There is no synagogue in Crawley, although a small Jewish community—followers of the Liberal form of Progressive Judaism—meet regularly. Planning permission for a synagogue had been granted in 1964, but it was never built. There is a small Sikh gurdwara in West Green; in January 2009 planning permission was granted for its demolition and replacement with a larger two-storey structure, but as of no work has started.
The old villages of Three Bridges, Crawley and Ifield lay within the ancient parishes of Crawley and Ifield. Both of their 13th-century parish churches are still used for Anglican worship. Expansion of the borough's boundary has brought more churches into Crawley, including the early 11th-century church at Worth—formerly an isolated Wealden village at the centre of its own large parish. Ifield was a centre of Nonconformism in the 17th century: its Friends Meeting House was built in 1676, when more than 25% of the village's residents were Dissenters.
Listed status.
English Heritage has awarded listed status to seven church buildings in the district. A building is defined as "listed" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest" in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of "exceptional interest"; Grade II* is used for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest"; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of "special interest". As of February 2001, there were three Grade I-listed buildings, 12 with Grade II* status and 80 Grade II-listed buildings in the borough of Crawley. Additionally, Crawley Borough Council grants locally listed building status to buildings which have historical or architectural interest at a local level, but which are not of sufficient quality to merit listing at a national level. As of November 2010, five churches in the borough were on the local list.
Religious affiliation in Crawley.
According to the 2001 United Kingdom Census, 99,744 people lived in Crawley. Of these, 67.3% identified themselves as Christian, 4.4% were Muslim, 3.4% were Hindu, 0.7% were Sikh, 0.2% were Buddhist, 0.1% were Jewish, 0.3% followed another religion, 16.8% claimed no religious affiliation and 6.8% did not state their religion. The proportion of Christians is lower than the 71.7% in England as a whole, whereas there are more Muslims and Hindus in Crawley than in England overall: 3.1% of people in England are Muslim, and 1.1% are Hindu.
Communities with no dedicated building.
There are several communities in Crawley that do not worship at a building used solely for religious purposes. The non-denominational Crawley Family Church uses Waterfield Primary School, which opened in 1985 in Bewbush. Also in Bewbush, an Elim Pentecostal congregation meets weekly at Bewbush Community Primary School; regular prayer meetings, study groups and other social activities take place elsewhere in the neighbourhood. The congregation was established in May 2005. This church is associated with the Elim church in Langley Green. The Crawley Gatwick Church of Christ, an independent, non-denominational congregation formed in 1996, meets at the community centre in Gossops Green. The Salvation Army established a barracks in 1902 in West Green, but the Crawley branch is now based in Ifield: worship takes place at the neighbourhood's community centre. The Kingdom Faith church, affiliated with a group of churches based in nearby Horsham, meets at Oriel High School in the Maidenbower neighbourhood and at Roffey Place, just over the borough boundary at Faygate. In 2006, a Pentecostalist community founded the Exodus Pentecostal Church, which worships at Tree House—Crawley's ancient manor house, now owned by the Borough Council. The weekly services cater especially for residents from Diego Garcia and Mauritius. Also in the town centre, the Potter's House Church uses the church hall of St John the Baptist's Church. It is part of the London Fellowship of Potter's House Christian Fellowship churches. The Solution International Christian Centre, a non-denominational fellowship founded in January 2009, is based at Northgate Community Centre. The Vine Christian Fellowship meets in a hotel in Southgate and holds joint services in the New Life and Green Fields Baptist churches. The Powerhouse Revival Centre meets for worship at the community centre on Ifield Drive in the Ifield neighbourhood.
Gatwick Airport.
One of London's international airports, Gatwick Airport, was moved into the Borough of Crawley in 1974. A year earlier, a multi-faith chaplaincy had been established in the terminal building (now the South Terminal). The chaplaincy is coordinated by the Anglican minister, whose licence was renewed in November 2008. Roman Catholic and Free Church ministers are also on site. When the North Terminal was built, a similar chapel was provided there. Both chapels are open at all times for prayer and meditation, and offer regular services throughout the week.

Archeological Sites at Kawela

Archeological Sites at Kawela are a number of archeological sites at or near the settlement of Kawela on the southern coast of Molokai, the northernmost of the islands of Maui County, Hawaii. It was the site of two battles in Hawaiian history.
Early history.
"Ka Wela" means "the heat" in the Hawaiian language. It was the name of a traditional land division ("ahupuaa") of ancient Hawaii, but the name is also used on several other islands.
It is located about east of the town of Kaunakakai.
A "heiau" is visible at on a ridge between the forks of Kawela glutch.
This is generally thought to be the place of refuge ("Puuhonua") where the soldiers of Kapiioho o kalani fled during a great battle of about 1737.
In about February 1795, women and children escaped to Molokai when Kamehameha I had just conquered Maui. In pursuit, the vast fleet of war canoes stretched all along the coast from Kawela past Kaunakakai to the area known as Kalamaula. The army met little resistance this time. Queen Kalola was asked if the two kingdoms could be united by marrying off her daughter Keōpūolani, who was considered to have the best royal family background, and thus would be suitable as a mother of future rulers. Her sons and grandsons would rule the Kingdom of Hawaii as the House of Kamehameha.
In the late 19th century it was part of the vast Molokai Ranch owned by King Kamehameha V and managed by the family of Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer.
Recent history.
The area now has a few vacation homes along the shore, and one subdivision of 120 lots that are zoned for agriculture on the hills. Wadsworth Y. H. Yee, in the Hawaii Senate from the Republican Party of Hawaii proposed the development in the 1970s. Ground was broken on December 20, 1980.
Wetlands and an ancient fishpond near the shore are preserved in the Kakahaia National Wildlife Refuge and Kakahaia park administered by Maui County.
There are 21 which are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The names used in the NRHP all start with the words "Archeological Site" and then an optional list of site numbers from a survey done by the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum when the development was proposed with a letter "T" followed by a dash, and then a state site identifier which four numbers separated with dashes, starting with "50-60" indicating the 50th state of Hawaii and the county of Maui County, a map quadrant, and site within the state registry. 
The sites are scattered through the area, and are located on private property so generally not accessible to the public.

Nunavik Peninsula

Nunavik Peninsula () is a large peninsula in northwestern Greenland. It separates two cultural and geographical regions of northwestern Greenland: Uummannaq Fjord region in the southeast, and Upernavik Archipelago in the north.
Geography.
The peninsula extends to the south-west from mainland Greenland (). The waters around the peninsula are that of Baffin Bay. To the south and southeast the peninsula is bounded by the Uummannaq Fjord system, an inlet of Baffin Bay. Ukkusissat Fjord carves deeply into the terrain, running south to north-east-north around the eastern part of the peninsula covered with the Sermikavasak glacier.
Inner fjords.
Several fjords cut deep into the peninsula. Running from the western shore inland to then turn north, Sullua (4x50km) is the main waterway, cutting the peninsula into two parts, northwestern being the smaller. Parallel Umiiviup Kangerlua (4x8km) and Kangiusap Imaa (3x7km) fjord bays cut into the southeastern shore, branching off the Uummannaq Fjord system.
Settlements.
The peninsula is administered as part of the Qaasuitsup municipality. It is largely uninhabited − permanent settlements are located in the Upernavik Archipelago off the north-west-northern coast of the peninsula, including Upernavik Kujalleq, Kangersuatsiaq, Upernavik town, and Aappilattoq. There are several settlements on the islands off the southwestern coast, including Nuugaatsiaq and Illorsuit in the Uummannaq Fjord system. Ukkusissat is the only mainland settlement in the vicinity, located on the smaller, Ukkusissat Peninsula.
Geology.
Rocks and sediments on Nunavik Peninsula are of Cretaceous and Paleocene origin, with further layers deposited during the movement of Greenland towards the North Pole. Similarly to the Uummannaq area, ancient volcanic basalts are exposed throughout the peninsula.

Walnut Park Historic District

The Walnut Park Historic District is located in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse, New York, adjacent to the Syracuse University campus. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Walnut Park.
The park was deeded to the city in 1870 by prominent citizen George Comstock. Walnut Park is itself a three-block long park. The long sides of the park are bordered on the west by Walnut Place, on the east by Walnut Avenue. Cross streets are Harrison Street, Adams Street, Marshall Street, and Waverly Avenue from north to south. The park was originally landscaped with shade trees, but the Dutch Elm disease wiped out that overall effect in the 1950s. In 1972, new trees were planted. These trees have reached maturity and restored some of the original atmosphere to the park.
Establishment of the Neighborhood.
The neighborhood surrounding Walnut Park was originally established by some of the social elite of Syracuse. Community leader and banker George Comstock, after donating the property for the park, chose carefully the people to whom he sold building lots. 
George H. Bond had the house at 304 Walnut Place built in 1899. He was Onondaga County District Attorney, and founder of the still existent law firm of Bond, Schoeneck and King. The house reflects elements of both the Queen Anne style popular up to that time and the Georgian Revival style becoming popular. The house was later owned by Syracuse University and known as "Blackwell Cottage". It is now the home of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.
The house at 701 Walnut Place is now owned by Syracuse University and known as the "Chancellor's Residence". It was built for attorney William Nottingham in 1901. The house was designed in the Jacobethan Revival style by architects Brockway and Benson of New York City. Leather lines the library walls. The living room ceiling is decorated with Gothic tracery. The central staircase is carved. A ballroom graces the third floor.
The Chateauesque house next door at 703 Walnut Avenue was built for Crucible Steel owner and president Horace Wilkinson in 1905. Gaggin and Gaggin architects of Syracuse designed it. The interior woodworking is various and impressive. Theodore Roosevelt, while engaged in the Barnes-Roosevelt libel case, stayed here as a guest of the family for a month. The house now belongs to Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, of which American radio and television personality Dick Clark was a member. 
Other notable Syracusans that built their homes here included clergyman and archbishop the Reverend Huntington, A.E. Nettleton of the Nettleton Shoe Company and Paragon Plaster, and the Denison family.
Fraternity/Sorority Row.
In 1915 the Alpha Phi sorority bought the house at 308 Walnut Place. Around 1921 the houses at 208 and 210 Walnut Place and the one at 901 Walnut Avenue all became sorority or fraternity houses. In 1923 house at 300 Walnut Place was sold to the Delta Delta Delta sorority. The house at 310 Walnut Place was built around 1925 for the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the house at 803 Walnut Avenue was built for Gamma Phi Beta sorority. In 1928, Kappa Alpha Theta sorority had local architect Marjorie Wright design their Tudor style house at 306 Walnut Place. In 1937 the house at 907 Walnut Avenue also became a "Greek" house. Over the following decades, more fraternities and sororities moved in, making the area the Fraternity/Sorority Row of Syracuse University.
Block Party.
Walnut Park was the traditional home of Syracuse University's "Block Party", an event celebrating the coming of spring with live entertainment in an outdoor setting. In 1993, amid concerns of over-crowding and excessive drinking, the University moved the event to a more readily controllable indoor venue.

The Department of Labour deals with Labour related issues through its divisions which are the labour relations division, labour research & economics division, international relations division, registration process division and the national employment services division. The Department of Social Services (DSS), which is the main focal point of the assignment, is responsible for finance and administration, rehabilitation, family and child welfare, and policy and programming.
DSS, like many other government departments, was enormously affected by the economic decline, caused by the high Inflation rate which had peaked to 231 million per cent, characterized by high prices and unemployment which left 1.5 million households in poverty, homes to some 3.5 million children. (National Action Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable Children II 2011). 
As economic growth declined in Zimbabwe, so did the labour absorptive capacity of the economy such that by 2004, four out of every five jobs in Zimbabwe were informalised, resulting in massive decent work deficits. Unemployment rates had remained below 10 per cent between 1982 and 2004 (CSO, LFS, 2004). However, during the same period there was a decline in formal employment (from 1.1 million in 1993 to 990 000 in 2002), and a corresponding increase in informal employment. (UN Country analysis Report 2010)The high unemployment rate which estimated to led to the lack of professional expertise in different organisations following the exodus of qualified social workers as well as other professionals in search of greener pastures in neighbouring countries and abroad. Over 70% people migrating to South Africa, had economic purpose for migrating. (Tevera and Zinyama 2002).

Walter Potter

Walter Potter (2 July 1835 – 21 May 1918) was an English taxidermist noted for his anthropomorphic dioramas featuring mounted animals mimicking human life, which he displayed at his museum in Bramber, Sussex, England. The exhibition was a well-known and popular example of "Victorian whimsy" for many years, even after Potter's death; however enthusiasm for such entertainments waned in the twentieth century, and his collection was finally dispersed in 2003.
Early life and popularity.
Potter's family ran The White Lion pub in Bramber, and as a teenager, his first attempt at taxidermy was to preserve the body of his own pet canary. At the age of 19, inspired by his sister, Jane, who showed him an illustrated book of nursery rhymes, Potter produced what was to become the centrepiece of his museum, a diorama of "The Death and Burial of Cock Robin", which included 98 species of British birds. This was so well-received that in 1861, he opened a separate display in the summer house of the pub. While satisfying the Victorian demand for traditional stuffed animals to earn a living, Potter continued creating his dioramas and expanded into new premises in 1866, and again in 1880. As his museum expanded, Potter married a local girl, Ann Stringer Muzzell, and they had three children, Walter, Annie and Minnie.
Amongst his scenes were "a rats' den being raided by the local police rats ... village school ... featuring 48 little rabbits busy writing on tiny slates, while the Kittens' Tea Party displayed feline etiquette and a game of croquet. A guinea pigs' cricket match was in progress, and 20 kittens attended a wedding, wearing little morning suits or brocade dresses, with a feline vicar in white surplice." Potter's attention to detail in these scenes has been noted, to the extent that "The kittens even wear frilly knickers under their formal attire!" Apart from the simulations of human situations, he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two-headed lambs and four-legged chickens.
Potter's collection, billed as ""Mr Potter's Museum of Curiosities"" was to build into a "world-famous example of Victorian whimsy", with special coach trips from Brighton being arranged; and the village and Potter's museum were so popular that an extension was built to the platform at Bramber railway station.
Later life, death and decline of the museum.
Potter suffered a stroke in 1914, from which he never fully recovered, and died at the age of 82; he was buried in Bramber churchyard. His museum, which by that time contained about 10,000 specimens, was taken over by his daughter and grandson. The Victorian enthusiasm for stuffed animals had waned by the museum's later days, and it deflected claims of animal cruelty by displaying notices stating that all the animals had died naturally and that "in any case, they were all over 100 years old". The "Kittens' Wedding" scene, the last created by Potter in 1890, was shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2001 as part of "The Victorian Vision" exhibition.
Sale of the collection.
The museum closed in the 1970s, and, after having been moved to Brighton and then to Arundel, was sold in 1984 to the owners of Jamaica Inn, Bolventor, Cornwall, where it attracted more than 30,000 visitors each year. The death of their taxidermist and economic considerations sapped the venture of its viability, and, when a buyer to maintain the collection intact did not come forward, it was auctioned by Bonhams in 2003, realizing over £500,000. "The Kittens' Wedding" was sold for £21,150, and "The Death and Burial of Cock Robin" was the highest-selling item of the sale, raising £23,500. Present at the auction were Peter Blake, Harry Hill and David Bailey. 
A bid of £1m offered by Damien Hirst for the entire collection had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to "The Guardian" citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying "You can see he knew very little about anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher" He also showed appreciation for the displays: "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on "Wind in the Willows". And a group of hamsters playing cricket." About the auction, Hirst said, "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy."
The White Lion pub, home of Potter's collection, has now been renamed The Castle Hotel.

Phillip Musica

Philip Mariano Fausto Musica (1877–1938), also known as F. Donald Coster, was a swindler whose criminal career spanned parts of three decades. His various crimes included tax fraud, bank fraud and bootlegging. However, he is best known as the mastermind of the McKesson & Robbins scandal of 1938, one of the largest financial scandals ever perpetuated by a single person.
Early life.
Musica was born in 1877 in Naples to Antonio and Maria Musica. He moved to New York City at the age of seven and grew up in Mulberry's Bend, a rough neighborhood in Little Italy. Philip would eventually have three brothers and a sister. As a boy, Musica admired Theodore Roosevelt, at the time the city's hard-charging police commissioner.
First convictions for fraud.
A. Musica and Son.
Musica dropped out of school at the age of 14 to help out at his father's small grocery store, A. Musica and Son. Within two years, he was running the store. He soon left day-to-day operations to his younger brother Arthur while turning his own attention to building an import-export operation. By importing cheese, olive oil and spices directly from Italy (as opposed to using a middleman), he was able to underprice his competitors. Within a few years, A. Musica and Son was one of the largest importers of Italian food in New York, grossing a half-million dollars a year. The Musicas moved to a home in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and became leaders of the city's Italian community. 
There was a dark secret to the store's success, however. Musica bribed dock officials to replace the real bills of lading with phony ones listing the weights of their shipments as substantially lighter than they really were. The unpaid tariffs grew to astronomical proportions when the Musicas increased their orders. Combined with the lower prices they paid for importing directly, they substantially outsold all their competitors in Little Italy.
However, in 1909 Mayor George McClellan, Jr. began a drive to clean up the East River waterfront. Police soon discovered the fraud, and Philip and Antonio Musica were arrested for tax evasion, tax fraud and bribery. Musica pleaded guilty in return for having the charges against his father dropped (even though his father had signed several of the phony invoices) and served a year in jail. However, President William Howard Taft pardoned him after only six months.
U.S. Hair.
Not long after getting out of jail, Musica founded the United States Hair Company, ostensibly to sell hairpieces that fashionable women of the day used to create elaborate hairstyles. Good-quality hair sold for as much as $80 a pound. Musica had his mother gather up nearly worthless sweepings from barbershop floors. He then put them in crates with a layer of expensive hair on top. The money was soon rolling in again, and Musica moved his family to a larger house in Bay Ridge. He also bought a suite at the Knickerbocker Hotel.
Musica sent his mother to Italy with the ostensible purpose of getting loans to finance the shipment of long strands of human hair across the Atlantic. The bankers bought the story, and Musica soon set up satellite offices around the world. However, these were nothing more than maildrops for the paper trail to support the existence of the company's nonexistent inventory. In July 1912, U.S. Hair was capitalized at $2 million, with $600,000 in assets—mostly human hair located abroad. Three months later, Musica took the company public, and it was listed on the Curb Exchange. The original price of $2 a share jumped to $10, making Musica an instant millionaire.
Then just as fast as Musica rose, he fell—and this time almost as ignobly as he had three years before. By the time U.S. Hair went public, it was $500,000 in arrears to several banks. Two British banks got suspicious of U.S. Hair's financing and refused to honor some company drafts, sending U.S. Hair stock into a tailspin. In order to get as much money as possible out of the company before being unmasked, Musica sought a $370,000 loan from Bank of Manhattan (now part of JPMorgan Chase), pledging 216 crates of hair as collateral. However, a bank clerk discovered a bill of lading for Musica's collateral had been altered. Suspicious bank representatives went to the piers to inspect the hair, and discovered the crates held only a small layer of valuable hair. The rest of the contents were nearly worthless ends and short pieces. The total value of the contents in the warehouse was about $250. 
Musica got word that the bank had alerted federal authorities, and proceeded to strip his Bay Ridge home of virtually everything of value. The Musica family fled to various cities on the East Coast before meeting in New Orleans. They got on a ship intending to escape to Panama, but private detective William J. Burns was able to track them down by following a $12 steamer trunk Philip had bought at the Knickerbocker. Musica pleaded guilty in return for the dismissal of all charges against his family, claiming he'd been bilked by two European firms. Although the banks only recovered $70,000 of the $600,000 he'd swindled from them, he was able to curry favor with the authorities by informing on other inmates at The Tombs. Finally, in 1916, he was given a suspended sentence and released. 
He was then hired as a special investigator with the New York State Attorney General's office under the alias William Johnson. He spent most of the next three years chasing down suspected German spies and draft dodgers. However, his career ended when he tried to implicate William Randolph Hearst as a German collaborator. Musica was apparently trying to get back at Hearst for his unflattering coverage of the U.S. Hair scandal.
First bootlegging venture.
In 1920, after briefly going into the poultry business, Musica founded the Adelphi Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company, under the alias Frank D. Costa, with Joseph Brandino as his partner. Its nominal business was the manufacture of a hair tonic called "Dandrofuge" and cosmetics. In truth, it was a front for a bootlegging venture. In those days, hair tonic and cosmetics used large quantities of alcohol. Under the Prohibition laws, access to alcohol was strictly controlled, and Musica/Costa obtained a permit to draw 5,000 gallons of raw alcohol per month. 
Unlike U.S. Hair, Adelphi's business was very real. However, the great majority of his profits came from bootleggers who bought his tonic in large quantities and distilled out the alcohol to make beer and liquor. With the high premiums earned from the bootleggers, Musica was once again rolling in money. He kept two sets of books--a phony one showing sales at the normal competitive price, and a real one to account for the sales to bootleggers.
Adelphi was shut down in 1923 after telling the Treasury that Brandino had been abusing the permit. Three years earlier, he'd turned state's evidence against Brandino after the two were arrested for a Prohibition violation.
McKesson & Robbins scam.
Girard & Co..
Using the proceeds from Adelphi, Musica moved to the tiny suburb of Mount Vernon, New York in 1923, where he set up Girard & Co., another company that made Dandrofuge tonic. He also legally changed his name to Frank Donald Coster, or F. Donald Coster. He billed himself as a native of Washington, D.C. with an M.D. and Ph.D. from the University of Heidelberg. He claimed to have only practiced medicine for three years before going into business.
Like Adelphi, Girard's hair tonic business was very real, but most of its profits were generated from bootleggers who simply bought Coster's tonic in large quantities and distilled out the alcohol to make booze. The bootleggers paid far higher premiums than the drugstores that made up Girard's legitimate customer base. One of his biggest customers was Dutch Schultz. 
As in the past, Coster brought his family in on this latest scam. He claimed to be running the company for the widow and sister of Horace Girard—roles played by his mother and sister Grace, respectively. His brother Arthur, under the alias George Vernard, set up W.W. Smith & Co. On paper, it was a sales agency that handled a large volume of Girard orders. In truth, it was nothing more than a "letter-writing plant" which generated fake purchase orders and mailed them to Girard. Another brother, Robert, under the alias Robert Dietrich, was Girard's head of shipping. He forged the necessary documents to make it look like the inventory had actually been shipped out. Another brother, George, under the alias George Dietrich, served as company treasurer and moved money between accounts to make it look like the "customers" had paid for the "orders."
To lend his scheme greater legitimacy, Coster asked Price Waterhouse to audit Girard & Co. In those days, auditors didn't check inventories, but only checked a company's books and supporting documents. Relying entirely on fraudulent documents provided by Girard, Price Waterhouse listed the company as having $1.1 million in sales, profits of $250,000 and assets of $295,000. When it examined W. W. Smith & Co., Girard's biggest customer, Price Waterhouse relied on the faked purchase orders as well as a forged report from Dun & Company (now part of Dun & Bradstreet) stating that W. W. Smith was worth $7 million.
The scheme succeeded with flying colors, and Coster soon moved the company to Fairfield, Connecticut. Also, he and his wife Carol (whom he had married after wrecking her previous marriage to a business associate) moved to an 18-room, seven-acre estate in Fairfield. While it was an open secret that Girard was really a bootlegging operation—in fact, it was the biggest bootleg distributor on the East Coast—Coster's ties to Connecticut politics and business, as well as his talent for bribery, kept any investigations from going anywhere.
Buying McKesson.
Coster wanted to become a major player on Wall Street, and saw his chance when he found out that McKesson & Robbins, a well-respected drugmaker and distributor, was up for sale. He also wanted to avert any suspicion of his real activities. In 1926, he merged Girard & Co. with McKesson for $1 million, and Musica became the merged company's president.
The McKesson purchase gave Coster an even larger front for his bootlegging operation. However, he also pumped up McKesson's legitimate business, and led a drive to open up several foreign markets. During his first full year as company president, 1927, he incorporated a Canadian subsidiary to trade in crude drugs. Unlike the rest of the company, only Coster and George Dietrich—better known as George Musica—had access to the accounts of this new division. That year, the company turned a $600,000 profit. 
Coster grew even richer, buying a 28-room mansion in Fairfield, a yacht, racing horses, and a stable of cars. His machine continued to roll through the Great Depression until by 1937, McKesson was the third-largest drug company in the world. However, he remained an intensely private man, in part out of fear of being unmasked. For instance, he turned down an offer to run for president in 1936 on the Republican ticket.
Collapse.
Coster's downfall began in 1937, when McKesson board ordered him to convert $2 million of his crude drugs into cash to build up profits and reduce outstanding debt. Coster responded with a demand that the firm obtain a $3 million loan "for improvements."
Julian Thompson, the company's treasurer, was puzzled by this demand. He figured a firm as successful as McKesson shouldn't need to obtain an outside loan. Several aspects of the company's arrangement with W. W. Smith and Co. also troubled him. On a hunch, he contacted Dun & Bradstreet, who informed him W. W. Smith's report was a forgery. He also discovered that the crude-drug division was more or less nonexistent, and that in 1929 Coster had looted the division of $640,000 to cover losses on the stock market. Altogether, Thompson discovered Coster had stolen $3 million from McKesson over the years. 
When Thompson confronted Coster with his findings, Coster accused him of "trying to wreck this company." He then tried to place the company in equity receivership in order to throw Thompson off the scent long enough to cover up the fraud. However, Thompson countered by having the board file for bankruptcy protection under the Chandler Act. After an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coster, Vernard, and George Dietrich were arrested and released on bail on December 13.
An investigator with the New York state attorney general's office thought he recognized Coster's face as that of former investigator William Johnson—the alias Musica had used after his release from The Tombs. A check revealed Coster's fingerprints to be an exact match to those of Musica. At a midnight press conference on December 15, officials dropped a bombshell—F. Donald Coster, the now-disgraced drug tycoon, was really two-time convicted fraudster Philip Musica. 
Musica got word that he'd been unmasked, and that federal marshals were on their way to arrest him. Unwilling to face almost certain conviction and a long prison term, he locked himself in the bathroom and shot himself in the head on the morning of December 16. He was careful to stand in a way that when he fell into a large marble bathtub, none of his blood stained the carpet on the floor.
Nazi Propaganda.
Muscia was mentioned in the 1938 Nazi pamphlet Roosevelt verrät Amerika! (Roosevelt Betrays America!) by Dr. Robert Ley. He wrote "The Coster-Musica scandal aroused considerable excitement in the American business world at the end of 1938. Coster-Musica had carried out swindles on a widespread scale, including drug smuggling, weapons sales, and crooked dealings, and was a member of many prominent clubs. Coster-Musica had been in jail for fraud as yearly as 1906. He was convicted in a huge financial scandal in 1913. Given his connections to “high society,” he did not serve time in prison. His company collapsed when the fraud was discovered. 13,500 stockholders lost over $100 million. He committed suicide because he feared his well-placed friends were no longer able to protect him from the wrath of those he had cheated."

Sturm-Infanteriegeschütz 33B

The Sturm-Infanteriegeschütz 33B was a German self-propelled heavy infantry gun used during World War II. A new, fully enclosed, and heavily armored boxy casemate superstructure was built on the chassis of the Sturmgeschütz III. It mounted the improved sIG 33/1 infantry gun, offset to the right side, for which 30 rounds were carried. It could only traverse 3° left and right, elevate 25°, and depress 6°. A Maschinengewehr 34 machine-gun was fitted in a ball mount on the left side of the superstructure with 600 rounds. Its traverse limits were 15° left and 20° right, and it could elevate 20° and depress 10°.
Sources differ as to the development history. Chamberlain and Doyle say that Alkett was ordered in July 1941 to convert a dozen Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. E chassis and that these were finished in December 1941 and January 1942 - but not issued. On 20 September 1942, another dozen Sturmgeschutz IIIs were ordered to be converted, and the existing vehicles were rebuilt. Trojca and Jaugitz contend that all twenty-four were built by Alkett starting in September 1942 from repaired Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. B, C, D and E chassis.
The first dozen were delivered by the end of October 1942 and assigned to Sturmgeschütz-Abteilungen (Assault Gun Battalions) 177 and 244, then fighting in Stalingrad. The remaining dozen vehicles could not be delivered to Sturmgeschütz-Abteilungen 243 and 245, also fighting in Stalingrad, after the Soviets surrounded the German 6th Army on 21 November. Instead, the vehicles were formed into Sturm-Infanterie-Geschütz-Batterie/Lehr-Bataillon (Assault Infantry Gun Batterie/Demonstration Battalion) XVII. The battalion was assigned to the 22nd Panzer Division as the Germans attempted to relieve the trapped 6th Army. The Division was virtually wiped out in the fighting and the battery was assigned to the 23rd Panzer Division where it became the Sturm-Infanterie-Geschütz-Batterie/Panzer-Regiment 201 (also known as 9. Kompanie/Panzer-Regiment 201) for the rest of the war. The last strength report to mention them lists five remaining in September 1944.Only one survived at the Kubinka NIIBT Research Collection at Russia.

Kate Dennison

Kate Dennison (born 7 May 1984) is an English pole vaulter. She is a former British record holder both indoors and out, before both of her records were surpassed by Holly Bleasdale in 2011.
Born in Durban, South Africa, Dennison came from a sporting family and moved to Alsager, England, when she was four years old. She first became interested in athletics through gymnastics. Dennison was selected to compete at national and international levels, finishing fourth in the British Championships, but did not feel passionate about the sport and changed to pole vault in 2000. She became the first British junior athlete to jump 4.00 metres, as she finished seventh at the 2002 World Junior Championships in Kingston, Jamaica.
She competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and was the top English performer, finishing seventh overall. Dennison completed a degree in psychology at Staffordshire University and turned professional, committing herself full-time to the sport. Following graduation, she moved to be trained by Steven Rippon at the centre of excellence in Loughborough.
Dennison won two outdoor tournaments and five indoor titles in the 2007 athletics season. She competed at her first Olympic Games at Beijing 2008 and was knocked out in seventh place in the second heats but set a new outdoor personal best of 4.40 m. Following this she had surgery on both her Achilles, but this did not affect her form in the next season – she broke the national indoor record, beating Janine Whitlock's seven-year-old record, with a jump of 4.45 m at the 2009 UK Indoor Championships in Sheffield, and bettered that mark by another centimetre at the Birmingham Games a week later.
Following a successful indoor season, Dennison broke the British record in June with a vault of 4.51 m at the Memorial Josefa Odlozila meeting in Prague. Despite the achievement she felt confident of further improvement, setting her eyes on a place in the final at the Berlin World Championships. Another personal best of 4.55 m brought her fourth place in the European Team Championships 2009. After a win at the UK national championships with 4.57 m, she noted the difficulty of the competition she faced in Berlin: a number of athletes from Germany, Poland, and Russia, including reigning champion Yelena Isinbayeva, were in the running for a medal.
She recorded 4.55 m in the World Championships final, finishing in sixth place overall. A 4.60 m clearance for third place at the Pedros Cup brought an end to a successful season for the Briton, which had seen her beat the national record nine times over the course of eight months.
At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, Dennison won a bronze medal in the women's pole vault.
Personal bests.
Dennison is the British record holder in pole vault indoors, and she previously held the outdoor record. She beat Janine Whitlock's 4.47 m outdoor record in June 2009. She broke the British record nine times in 2009. Her own outdoor record of 4.60m was beaten by Holly Bleasdale in June 2011, with a jump of 4.70m.

Gerald Neugebauer

Gerald "Gerry" Neugebauer (born 3 September 1932) is an American astronomer known for his pioneering work in infrared astronomy.
Neugebauer was born in Göttingen, Germany and is the son of Otto Neugebauer, an Austrian-American mathematician and historian of science, and Grete Bruck. After moving to the United States at age seven, he received his A.B. in physics from Cornell University in 1954 and his Ph.D. in physics from Caltech in 1960, with a thesis on the photoproduction of negative and positive pions from deuterium.
During his military service with the U.S. Army he was stationed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and worked for the Ordnance Corps until 1962. He joined the Caltech faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor, becoming a full professor of physics in 1970. He was named Howard Hughes Professor in 1985 and Chairman of the Division of Physics, Math and Astronomy in 1988. He is currently the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Physics, Emeritus.
Neugebauer served as the director of the Palomar Observatory from 1980 to 1994.
Neugebauer is internationally recognized as a pioneer in infrared astronomy, and played a leading role in infrared studies of the planets. In addition—and largely through his activities with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)—he led both ground- and space-based infrared studies of the stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies. Observations by him and his colleagues at Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories revealed thousands of infrared sources in the sky, and afforded the first infrared view of the galactic center. Together with Robert B. Leighton, he completed the Two-Micron Sky Survey, the first infrared survey of the sky, which cataloged more than 5,000 infrared sources. Together with Eric Becklin, he discovered the Becklin-Neugebauer Object, an intense source of infrared radiation in the Orion Nebula that is (except for the Sun) the brightest object in the sky at wavelengths less than 10 micrometres.
Neugebauer played a major role in the design and construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Among Neugebauer's numerous awards are two NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medals (1972, 1984), the 1985 Space Science Award of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the 1985 Richmyer Lecture Award, the 1986 Rumford Prize, the 1996 Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, the 1998 Herschel Medal, and the 2010 Bruce Medal. He was named California Scientist of the Year for 1986 by the California Museum of Science and Industry, and he was elected to the National Academy of the Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Astronomical Society.
Neugebauer is married to the geophysicist Marcia Neugebauer, a pioneer in solar wind research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Both are retired and live in Tucson, Arizona.

<doc id="21540760" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21540760" title="Listicle">
Listicle

In journalism and blogging, a listicle is a short-form of writing that uses a list as its thematic structure, but is fleshed out with sufficient copy to be published as an article. A typical listicle will prominently feature a cardinal number in its title, such as "10 Ways to Warm Up Your Bedroom in Winter", "The 5 Most Badass Presidents of All-Time", or "25 Hairstyles of the Last Hundred Years", with subsequent subheadings within the text itself reflecting this schema. The word is a portmanteau derived from "list" and "article".
Types.
Ranked.
A "ranked" listicle (such as Rolling Stone's "The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years") implies a qualitative judgement, conveyed by the order of the topics within the text. These are often presented in countdown order, with the "Number One" item actually being the last in the sequence.
Thematic.
A "thematic" listicle imparts no such values, instead presenting the topics in whatever order the writer and/or editor deems appropriate.
Random.
A "random" listicle reflects no structure whatsoever; instead, it embraces an eclectic aesthetic, inviting the reader to assemble one's own conclusions from an array of disparate facts.
Media.
While conventional reportage and essay writing often require the careful crafting of narrative flow, the building-block nature of the listicle lends itself to more rapid production. It can also be a means of "recycling" information, as often it is the context, not the content, that is original. For example, a listicle of "Letterman’s 9 Most Hilariously Awkward Moments" can be constructed by adding captions to YouTube clips. For these reasons the form has come under criticism as a “kind of cheap content-creation”:
It's so easy you wonder why everyone doesn't do it until you realize that now it's all they do: Come up with an idea ("Top 10 Worst on the L train ride to the office that morning, [and slap together 10 (or 25, or 100) cultural artifacts ripe for the kind of snarky working over that won't actually tax you at all as a writer/thinker.
Digg and delicious and the rest are littered with Top 10s and geek equivalents of Cosmo coverlines. It's not long until we get "21 Ubuntu Install Tips That Will Drive Him Crazy In Bed!" 
Nevertheless, the form remains a mainstay of the newsstand and the web. The covers of magazines such as "Cosmopolitan" and "Men’s Journal" regularly sport at least one, if not several listicles" (see image above)". In 2009, postings in the format “25 Random Things About Me" became an internet phenomenon, starting on Facebook but spreading to the broader web, attracting considerable media coverage in the process. The website Gawker uses "Listicle" as a regular content category. Some websites are devoted almost entirely to the listicle format.
Collaborative.
Recently online platforms have embraced opening collaborative user generation of lists to the general public. Such sites include Demolistic, List.ly, Listicle, Listoid, Listphile, Lystee, Listgeeks, Unspun, and others.

USS Frederick Luckenbach (1888)

USS "Frederick Luckenbach" was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
"Frederick Luckenbach" was built as a commercial cargo ship in 1888 at South Shields, England, by J. Readhead and Company. She operated under the names SS "Charters Towers" and SS "San Mateo", and by the time the U.S. Navy acquired her at Cardiff, Wales, for World War I service on 2 October 1918 she was named SS "Frederick Luckenbach". On 5 October 1918 she was commissioned as USS "Frederick Luckenbach" with Lieutenant Commander H. A. Lewell, USNRF, in command.
"Frederick Luckenbach" carried coal for use by the United States Army from Cardiff and Belfast, Ireland, to French ports until 20 March 1919, when she sailed from Cardiff for New York City. She was decommissioned at New York on 7 May 1919 and returned to her owner.
Unlike most commercial ships commissioned into U.S. Navy service during World War I, "Frederick Luckenbach" never received a naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.).

Hellenic Seaways

Hellenic Seaways is a Greek shipping company operating passenger and freight ferry services in the Aegean and Adriatic Seas. The company is owned by Minoan Lines, which currently controls the majority stake.
History.
Hellenic Seaways was created in 2005 following the consolidation of Minoan Flying Dolphins and its subsidiaries Hellas Flying Dolphins, Hellas Ferries Saronikos Ferries and Sporades Ferries.
It is the biggest Greek shipping Company, which operates 24 vessels, 10 conventional, 12 high-speed and 2 RO-RO, servicing more than 35 ports in the Cyclades, North East Aegean, South East Aegean, Crete, Argosaronikos and Sporades.
In August 2009 Hellenic Seaways purchased the single-ship, budget cruise line easyCruise from founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
In January 2011 Minoan Lines (Heraklion) cancelled the sale of it´s 33,35% stake in Hellenic Seaways to ANEK and try to find a new buyer for it.
Fleet.
Hellenic Seaways operate a large fleet of high speed craft, conventional ferries and RO/RO freight ferries.
Terminated Routes.
Hellenic Seaways covered itineraries to Chania in Crete island in the summer periods from 2004-2006 with the highspeed vessel "Highspeed 4" in 4 hours and 30 minutes, and in summer 2007 with the passenger ferry "Ariadne". The company also launched routes from Piraeus to Rethymno port, in Crete with Highspeed 5 in summer 2008. In the summer season of 2010 Hellenic Seaways launched for the first time itineraries from Piraeus to Dodecanese islands, Kos and Rhodes, (through Paros) with the passenger ferry "Nissos Rodos" but after an unsuccessful period they cancelled them.
Bonus & Miles.
Bonus & Miles is the frequent program of Hellenic Seaways. For every 1000 miles a member collects, the company refunds them with 10% of the total price of the tickets they have purchased. Upon completion of 3000 miles, the members are upgraded to the "Gold Member" status and enjoy additional privileges on board.
Saronikos Joint Venture.
In late 2013 Hellenic Seaways formed a joint venture with rivals "Nova Ferries" and "2Way Ferries". Created to offer better schedules and better prices for the consumers, the joint venture marketed as "Saronic Ferries" uses four vessels and covers a total of four destinations.
Awards.
In 2007 Hellenic Seaways was awarded by "Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards" as "The Best Passenger Line of the Year 2007" and their, then new-building vessel, Nissos Chios, was awarded with the prize of "The Best Ship of the Year 2007".

List of Cyathus species

"Cyathus" is a genus of fungi in the family Nidulariaceae. Along with the genera "Crucibulum", "Mycocalia", "Nidula" and "Nidularia", they are known collectively as the bird's nest fungi due to their small nest-like fruiting bodies containing egg-shaped peridioles. The genus "Cyathus" was monographed by mycologist Lloyd (1906), and later Brodie (1975, 1984), and their species concepts, especially those of Brodie (1975), are followed by most mycologists.
Taxonomic characters.
The differentiation of "Cyathus" species is based on observable characters, such as fruiting body shape, coverings and plications of peridia, and microscopic characteristics such as the anatomy of peridioles, and the size and shape of basidiospores. The following characters are used to help identify "Cyathus" species:

Species.
The following list of species is compiled from Brodie's monograph (1975) and subsequent revision (1984), as well as articles written since then describing new species or reducing others to synonymy.

Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009

The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (, ) is a law passed in the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2009.
Legislative history.
110th Congress.
On June 26, 2008, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico introduced the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2008 (). Although the bill had some support from both Democrats and Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate never voted on the measure due to threats by Senator Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma) to filibuster the bill.
111th Congress.
S. 22.
On January 7, 2009, Bingaman introduced the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (), a new bill which incorporated 159 bills that had been considered by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during the 110th Congress and, in some cases, earlier Congresses. 
Despite vehement opposition from Coburn and some other Republicans, the Senate passed a cloture motion on January 11 by a vote of 66-12 and then passed the bill on January 15 by a vote of 73-21, with four members not voting.
The bill was then sent to the House of Representatives, where it was expected to pass by a wide margin.
The bill was held at the desk instead of being sent to a committee.
On March 11, 2009, the House considered the bill under suspension of the rules, meaning that a two-thirds vote would be required for passage. Those voting in favor of the bill (predominantly Democrats) fell two votes short of a two-thirds majority, 282-144. 34 Republicans voted in favor of the bill, while three Democrats voted against it: Dan Boren of Oklahoma, Jim Marshall of Georgia, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota.
House Democrats could then have brought the bill back to the floor under regular procedure, which would have allowed Republicans to submit amendments to the bill. 
The bill, as voted on by the House, had been amended by Jason Altmire (D-Pennsylvania), to prohibit the closing of the lands described in the bill to hunting and fishing, presumably to persuade sportsmen and hunters to vote for the bill.
H.R. 146.
On March 3, 2009, the House of Representatives passed a bill under suspension of the rules, the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield Protection Act (), 394-13. On March 12, one day after the House failed to pass the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, Reid announced that he would file cloture on H.R. 146. While in the Senate, the bill was amended to include a majority of the text in S. 22. The Senate voted 73-21 for cloture and 77-20 to pass the bill. The House agreed to the Senate amendments, 285-140, on March 25.
President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on March 30, 2009, declaring one provision unconstitutional in his signing statement.
Components.
Title I.
Title I of the bill designates two million acres (8,000 km²) of wilderness in nine states (California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia) for protection through addition to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Among these lands are:
Title II.
Title II establishes a National Landscape Conservation System, to include Bureau of Land Management-administered National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, components of the National Trails System, components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
Title II also designates four new National Conservation Areas (Fort Stanton – Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area, Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area in Washington County, Utah, and Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area) and one new National Monument (the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument in the Robledo Mountains of New Mexico). It also transfers lands in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Washington to federal control.
Title III.
Title III authorizes the United States Secretary of Agriculture to, through the Chief of the United States Forest Service, conduct studies in the interest of preserving open space in southern Colorado and deliver "an annual report on the wildland firefighter safety practices...including training programs and activities for wildland fire suppression, prescribed burning, and wildland fire use, during the preceding calendar year." Title III also prohibits further oil and gas leasing, geothermal leasing, and mining patents in a stretch of the Bridger-Teton National Forest; this provision was based on a bill being crafted by Senator Craig L. Thomas of Wyoming before his death.
Title IV.
Title IV authorizes the Chief of the Forest Service to solicit (from regional foresters) nominations of forest landscapes of at least , primarily consisting of national forest lands, which are in need of "active ecosystem restoration," for the carrying out of ecological restoration treatments. The Chief, acting on behalf of the Secretary of Agriculture, then may select up to ten of these proposals, aided by a fifteen-member advisory board, to be funded in any given fiscal year. For each proposal selected, 50% of the expenditures of the execution and monitoring of ecological restoration treatments would be paid for by a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund in the United States Treasury. However, each proposal's expenditures are limited to $4 million per year.
Title V.
Title V designates thousands of miles of new additions to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. It also adds six trails to the National Trails System: the Arizona National Scenic Trail, the New England National Scenic Trail, the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail, the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail, the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.
Title VI.
Title VI creates a number of new United States Department of the Interior programs. One of these programs, the Wolf Livestock Loss Demonstration Project, gives states and Indian tribes federal grants to help livestock producers to reduce livestock loss due to predation by wolves in non-lethal ways, as well as for the purpose of compensating livestock producers for their loss of livestock due to predation by wolves. 
Another part of Title VI, the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, was originally a Senate bill introduced in 2007 by Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii). This provision establishes stronger penalties than previously required for nonpermitted removal of scientifically significant fossils from federal lands. The provision was endorsed and strongly supported by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, an international association of professional and amateur vertebrate paleontologists. In contrast, the Association of Applied Paleontological Sciences, an association of commercial fossil dealers, opposed the measure.
Title VII.
Title VII makes three additions to the National Park System and expands current National Park designations. It also authorizes an American Battlefield Protection Program, a Preserve America program, a Save America's Treasures Program, and a Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program, all to be carried out by the National Park Service.
New National Park System components would include:
Title VIII.
Title VIII designates ten new National Heritage Areas at the cost of $103.5 million:
Title IX.
Title IX authorizes three new studies to examine new reclamation projects under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation. It also creates 15 new water and endangered fish projects in four states. Furthermore, Title IX puts some federal water reclamation facilities under local control and funds conservation efforts.
Title X.
Title X codifies the settlements of three water disputes in California, Nevada, and New Mexico, in an effort to resolve decades of litigation.
Title XI.
Title XI reauthorizes the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 at a cost of $64 million per year through the year 2018. It furthermore authorizes groundwater surveys in New Mexico, also by the U.S. Geological Survey.
Title XII.
Title XII creates five new oceanic observation, research, and exploration programs at a cost of $2.6 billion, including programs for undersea research, undersea and coastal mapping, acidification research, and ocean conservation. One provision, the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act, would "establish a national integrated System of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems, Federal and non-Federal components coordinated at the national level by the National Ocean Research Leadership Council" in order to "support national defense, marine commerce, navigation safety, weather, climate, and marine forecasting, energy siting and production, economic development, ecosystem-based marine, coastal, and Great Lakes resource management, public safety, and public outreach training and education."
Title XIII.
Title XIII deals with miscellaneous bills, including one that funds the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii and another that increases the number of Assistant Energy Secretaries in the United States Department of Energy to eight. Title XIII also amends the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000 and the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act.
Title XIV.
Title XIV, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, provides $105 million over five years for coordinated paralysis research by the National Institutes of Health.
Title XV.
Title XV grants the Smithsonian Institution $69 million for laboratory and greenhouse construction at three Smithsonian facilities.
Acts amended.
The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 amended the following acts of Congress, in order of first appearance:

<doc id="21541014" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21541014" title="Photoprotein">
Photoprotein

Photoprotein refers to broadly to a type of protein from bioluminescent organisms. The term was first used to describe the unusual chemistry of the Chaetopterus luminescent system. This was meant to distinguish them from other light-producing proteins because these do not exhibit a luciferin-luciferase reaction, that is, a normal enzyme-substrate reaction. That is to say that they do not display typical enzyme kinetics as seen in luciferases.
Instead, these proteins display luminescence proportional to the amount of the protein. For example, the photoprotein aequorin will produce a flash of light when calcium is added rather than a prolonged glow that is seen for luciferases when luciferin is added. In this respect, it may appear that photoproteins are not enzymes, when in fact they do catalyze their bioluminescence reactions. This is due to a fast catalyic step, which produces the light, and a slow regeneration step, where the oxyluciferin is freed and another molecule of the luciferin will bind to the enzyme. Because of the kinetically slow step, each protein molecule must "recharge" with another molecule of luciferin before it can emit light again, and this makes it appear as though it is not behaving as a typical enzyme.
This can be considered analogous to flash bulbs for photograph used during the mid-20th century. During use, the magnesium filaments in each bulb would heat up to make a single flash (fast step), then the operator had to wait for the bulb to cool and exchange it out with a new bulb (slow step).
Such proteins are stable as a luciferin-photoprotein complex, often until the addition of another required factor such as Ca2+ for the photoprotein aequorin.

Prodesis

Prodesis was a development project in the Lacandon region of Chiapas, Mexico, that ran from 2004 to 2008.
The aim of the project was to reduce pressure on the rainforest and combat poverty among its inhabitants, most of them being Mayan Indians and subsistence peasants.
Plan and objectives.
Prodesis is an abbreviation of the Spanish name for the programme:
"Proyecto de Desarrollo Social Integrado y Sostenible, Chiapas, Mexico"
("Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project, Chiapas, Mexico").
Its overall objectives were:[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx/?Plan_Global_y_Planes_Operativos_Anuales]
These goals should stimulate a sense of citizenship, and enhance the relation between the Chiapas government and the 155,000 inhabitants of the 830 communities located around the protected area of the Lacandon Jungle: the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. This population, which is mainly indigenous and rural, has the highest levels of poverty and marginalization in the State of Chiapas, and of Mexico as a whole.
"Prodesis" was a continuation the "Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Selva Lacandon Forest" (PIDSS), which in turn was a continuation of Plan Cañadas.
As re-formulated on start-up in 2003, "Prodesis" focussed on 16 of the 34 micro-regions identified by PIDSS. These "micro-regions" were defined by suitability for particular approaches to social and economic development and included Agua Azul, Avellanal, Amador Hernández, Betania, Benemerito de las Américas, Carmen Villaflores, Comunidad Lacandona, Damasco, Francisco I Madero, Maravilla Tenejapa, Marqués de Comillas, Nahá, Nuevo Francisco León, Nuevo Huixtán, Rio Blanco, and Santo Domingo.
Financing, organization, implementation & evaluation.
The project was a cooperation between the state of Chiapas and the European Union (EU), and was budgeted for €31.000.000, of which €16.000.000 was invested by the state of Chiapas. The EU contributed €15.000.000 through EuropeAid. The European project (or agreement) code is ALA/B7-310/2003/5756.
The history of PRODESIS stretches back to 1996 when a mission of 4 consultants visited Mexico and carried out an area appraisal to prepare a proposal for a Euro 5 million project to be carried out between SEMARNAP and the EC (Teyssier, Capietto and de Agostini, 1996). In late 1998 SEMARNAP responded to a set of key issues that had been raised by the EC Delegation in 1997, presented a reformulated proposal and requested that renewed consideration be given to the Project.
The 1996 proposal was appraised by a further mission, carried out in September 1999, made up of Dr. Alastair White (anthropologist & socioeconomist) and Torsten Mark Kowal (rural development forester and climate/environmental scientist), working for LTS Consultants, Scotland, UK. They reported on the ongoing feasibility of the Project as designed in 1996 through: (i) fact-finding to identify substantive changes in the socio-economic and political context; (ii) analysis of the logic and applicability of the original approach; (iii) appraisal of the probability of fulfilment of basic conditions, identified in 1996 as prerequisites for successful project implementation. The re-designed project was proposed to EU Aide Attaches in Sept 1999 and to EuropeAid in Brussels. The main points in the re-design were to require local project-orientated planning processes within all components to supersede the ambitious participatory planning component proposed in 1996; and emphasis was placed on defining options for achievable changes in land-use, for training specific groups in the alternative land use and microenterprises options, and for linking up community-level projects with credit and other funding sources. 
From 2000 to 2003 the project then awaited improvements in the social and political context, as well as due process by the EC and the Mexican Government. The go-ahead for Prodesis was agreed in 2001. Preparations and consultations started in 2002, and the final contract was signed December 2003. 
Following formal approval, given all the elapsed time, it was necessary to re-design the project yet again, and this was done by Dieter Paas and Arturo Arreola, once the project was tendered for European Technical Assistance in 2003.[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx] However, it is unclear how far the White/Kowal recommendations were accepted; nor is it evident how many of the changes proposed in 1999 to the 1996 proposal were then taken on board during the 2003 re-design once the project formally started up. No internet references exist that describe these inputs and their role. 
The project started in 2004 and initially was expected to run until 2007, but due to delays related to modifications of the project plan and financial issues between the EU and Mexico, the project then continued for an extra year until September 2008.
Prodesis was carried out by SeDeSol (Secretariat of Social Development of the State of Chiapas), and its director was Rodolfo Diaz Sarvide.
Christian Bouteille was the (European) head of the International Technical Assistance. The European Delegation in Mexico-City [http://www.delmex.ec.europa.eu/] was responsible for the European involvement in the project.
Despite some progress and the benefits resulting from the Prodesis investment,in 2008 a classified evaluation report, ordered by the European Commission, and conducted by IBF International Consulting in collaboration with B.A.a Consultors (Piero Di Giacinto, Jan Karremans, Thomas Pijnenburg) concluded that Prodesis had not achieved all its objectives. 
These strong criticisms were summarised by independent sources and can be read here or here [http://eljustoreclamo.blogspot.com/2008/01/chiapas-operacin-fracaso-comunidades.html. A further clear set of criticisms are summarised here [http://www.rmalc.org.mx/documentos/libros/libro%20EU-boell.pdf] that take Prodesis as a case study.
On the 13th and 14 October 2008 the 8th meeting of the Joint Committee (established Under the EU-Mexico Economic Partnership) Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement (Global Agreement) was held in Mexico City. Regarding the session on cooperation it was stated that:
"Both parties took note of the progress achieved in current projects in the fields of social development, economic cooperation and science and technology. The parties furthermore underlined the positive results of PRODESIS implementation and agreed to explore the possibility of continuing it with a second phase in the 2007-2013 Cooperation Programme."[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st14/st14478.en08.pdf]
In early 2009 it was decided that Prodesis was not going to be continued with a second phase in the Cooperation Programme.
Historical background of European involvement.
Prodesis was signed within the framework of the Free Trade Agreement and Association Agreement between the European Union and Mexico:[http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/mexico/index_en.htm]
"The new agreement should lead to liberalization of trade and investment between Mexico and the EU [...but also to...] greater social equality and a political system that is genuinely democratic and pluralist and respects human rights. [...] This agreement opens the door to a wide range of potential cooperation activities between the parties, and will allow the EU to provide Mexico with financial and technical assistance for such social programmes as action against poverty, regional development, and cooperation in the field of human rights and protection of indigenous communities. [...] With regard to the current political context in Mexico, the discussions on the new agreement are going hand-in-hand in Mexico with a complex internal political process of democratization and reform. [...] The process of reform currently underway is also being hindered by a range of other factors such as [...] the conflict in Chiapas, the activities of guerilla movements in a number of other areas and the human rights situation, one of the most dramatic recent examples being the massacre which occurred in Acteal on 22 December 1997 and which was strongly condemned by Parliament in its resolution of 15 January 1998. [...] The 1997 agreements [...] include a democracy clause or human rights clause as an essential component. This was a stumbling block to the signing of the framework agreement in 1991. Nevertheless, the difficulties which have arisen in the context of the transition process in Mexico have highlighted the importance of the "democracy clause". [...] Parliament therefore considered it vital that the "democracy clause" be included in the new agreement and that the applicability of the agreement would be conditional on strict respect for that clause."[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A4-1998-0156+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN]
Criticism of Prodesis.
On January 23, 2004 an article in the Mexican newspaper "La Jornada"reported that in the community of Nuevo San Rafael in the Lacandon forest, 23 houses were burned down and that the victims were chased into the jungle. February 3 Mexican news magazine Proceso suggested a link with a cooperation programme between Mexico and the EU.[http://www.proceso.com.mx/noticias_articulo.php?articulo=21506 On several Indymedia-sites [http://www.indymedia.org/it/2004/01/110358.shtml] and other news and community sites around the world it was soon suggested that the violence was perpetrated by the Mexican Army against the Zapatista Ch'ol tribe, and that the EU was involved in relation to Plan Puebla Panamá. Before the project even got started Prodesis was already accused of being a counter-insurgency project aimed at getting rid of the local population to gain control over the regions' natural resources.
Based on this information Member of the European Parliament Erik Meijer posed a question (E-0546/04, 26-2-2004) to the European Commission (see below).
Later it turned out that the perpetrators were local Indians themselves, intimidating newcomers who had settled in the abandoned houses of previous settlers. By chasing them off into the jungle and burning the houses they hoped to prevent future occupations by other competing peasants looking for a piece of land to live on. By sheer conspiracy thinking a land related conflict between rivaling indigenous groups had turned into a story of state terrorism and imperialism. None of the media reporting on the attack ever rectified their story.
Since early 2004 numerous critical articles (varying in factuality) about Prodesis have been published in Mexican newspapers (mainly La Jornada), magazines (Proceso Contralínea [http://www.contralinea.com.mx/), and on websites of local and international NGO's.
On the 9th of February 2007 58 representants of communities in the Lacandon region signed the Declaration of Moxviquil in which they demanded the project to be suspended. The most important reasons stated in the document were that they were not properly informed about the project, which is a violation of ILO convention 169 [http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169] and the Mexican Constitution (art.2). Another reason was that they did not see any serious effort in real social development, only some subsidies for cement, tin roofs, chickens and crops. After they had offered the declaration to the director of Prodesis and the head of the European Delegation in Mexico-City, some of those who signed the declaration were threatened by Prodesis staff: if they would stand by their signature, they would not receive any kind of government support anymore (like "opportunidades" or "procampo").
Historical background & previous development projects.
Also please see more about the socio-political context in the Lacandon region, and the predecessor-projects of Prodesis, Chiapas conflict.
Until the 1950s, the Selva Lacandona covered an area of about 1.3 million hectares (13,000 km2). By the mid-1990s the pristine forest had been reduced to about 400,000 or at most 450,000 ha. The Lacandón Indians, who until the 1950s were the still the only inhabitants of the Selva Lacandona, were then only about 600 persons, having been reduced from much larger numbers by the diseases brought in the late nineteenth century to which they had no immunity, brought by the mahogany cutters who first penetrated the area. The Lacandones by late last century numbered about 800. Due to demographic pressure, since the late 1950s and especially in the 1970s, about 80,000 other Indians originating in the highlands of Chiapas have occupied parts of the forest area. They are mainly Tzeltals (56% of the present population), with some Tojolabales (17%), Chols (11%) and Tzotzils (2%). 
The small Maya Lacandón communities were outside the monetary economy until recent decades and their main monetary income today comes from the sale of craft items. In 1972, as part of a state government manoeuvre in relation to timber extraction, the Lacandones were granted formal ownership of the 614,000 hectares of the ‘Bienes Comunales Lacandones’ then established, but in 1978 were obliged to share this with some 15,000 Tzeltal and Chol settlers then granted communal rights. The majority of Lacandones do not possess cattle so have little negative impact on the forest, whereas in all the other communities, a better-off part of the population owns some beef-cattle, constituting an important form of saving and investment. Cattle are managed extensively, each head requiring about a hectare of land, and forest areas are frequently converted to pasture.
Marqués de Comillas, previously part of the Selva Lacandona forest, began to be settled by the same Indian groups in the 1970s. Then it was colonised in 1974-86 by settlers coming largely from other Mexican states, though the ejidos that were then formed absorbed the already-settled Tzeltal and other Chiapas Indian groups. Some 10-15% of the total population of the Selva Lacandona area are now mestizos (non-Indians) concentrated in Marqués de Comillas. At the time of settlement, the only communications were by river and by air, and some of the settlers left in the early years finding themselves unsuited to the pioneer life. As a result of the early unattractiveness of the area, the generation of settlers was able to obtain larger areas of land than the 20 hectares usually available to ejidatarios (heads of family on land distributed under the Mexican agrarian reform laws) elsewhere, with 50 hectares a common allocation. However, the interior of the Marqués de Comillas triangle remains poorly served by roads, and this has affected the growth of the communities where substantial concentrations of poverty are still found. 
Between about 1958 and 1986, both the Chiapas State and Federal governments either actively or passively favoured migration to “undeveloped” forest-land. The Chiapas state government looked favourably upon the migration of Indians to the Selva Lacandona, as it tended to reduce the pressure on land and particularly the demands for land reforms in parts of Chiapas where a latifundio system predominated. In the early 1960s and in 1974-86 two periods of federal government-sponsored colonisation occurred, the latter focused on Marqués de Comillas. This was a question of relieving pressures on the land elsewhere in the country.
Until 1986, government policy was by no means clearly oriented to protecting the forest. State-led exploitation of the forest’s precious woods was managed by COFOLASA/CORFO during the 1970s and 80s (cedar and particularly mahogany), as against private companies with largely North American capital who first entered the region in the 1850s. Valuable timber was extracted in this period from areas within the areas formally owned by the Comunidad Lacandona, as well as from Marqués de Comillas, as COFOLASA/CORFO was most active during the period of maximum conversion of forest for agriculture as colonisation proceeded.
Between the mid-1970s and 1986 agricultural and forestry policies continued to be inconsistent. Government statements and actions included both support for maintaining the forest (e.g. the proclamation of the Biosphere Reserve of Montes Azules in 1978); and support for activities which would have the opposite effect (e.g. legalisation of landholdings on the western side of the forest, and the opening-up of Marqués de Comillas with credit support for cattle, as well as state-sponsored oil exploration). Efforts to promote sustainable timber production in Marqués de Comillas began in 1987 and, after a Chiapas State ban on timber extraction from 1990 to 1994, restarted in 1995.
Since 1987 there has been an overall consistent policy of discouraging, if not preventing new settlement. The negotiated departure has been sought of those settled within the Biosphere Reserve post-1978 without land-rights. 
Government policy, as executed by a variety of state and federal authorities since the early 90s, has broadly sought to encourage a shift to sustainable agriculture so as not to make further inroads into the forest, but without great success due to weaknesses in conception and implementation - including the lack of participatory agricultural extension as proposed should be the methods used by PRODESIS. 
During the mid-1990s, SEMARNAP had established environmentally-orientated subsidies for maize cultivation (termed ‘milpa sedentarizada’), to prevent the burning of cut-over forest or reclaimed fallow, and to stop annual burns of weeds and crop residues. However, the quota of families to receive these subsidies in each community is usually limited and the money typically arrives very late, which greatly reduces the incentive effect. Subsidies in money and kind are also given for other crops (coffee, organic vegetables, and saplings for timber plantations), but are subject to the same limitations. Inputs have also been given for minor animal husbandry projects. Numerous small economic projects for particular communities have been implemented with a low success rate, as little participatory planning was practised, and there has been little training of community members in the management of such projects.
State intervention patterns have created a situation in which government funds have become an important potential source of direct income, and this has affected local attitudes and behaviour. Communities wait and call for government schemes before taking action and can become disinclined to take local initiatives. A ‘dependency syndrome’ has developed that is often pronounced among the poorer communities, for which the government funds assume greater significance relative to their earnings from production. At least in some communities (Nueva Palestina) the incipient differentiation and the availability of government funds has led to tensions within the community: as to whether funds should go the better-off to further their entrepreneurial activities, or be reserved for the more disadvantaged sections of the community.
Criticism of Prodesis and European involvement in the historical context.
Despite the considerable development and biodiversity justifications for setting-up Prodesis, like its predecessor-projects PIDSS and Plan Cañadas, was perceived by (a part of) the population and NGO's (local as well as international) as a counter-insurgency "light" project. 
Something that sustained this scepticism was the fact that Prodesis focussed extensively on the demographic aspects of ""The Chiapas Problem"", and hardly referred to the socio-political history of the area where Prodesis was implemented. By blaming the Chiapas conflict on overpopulation in a vulnerable environment, but avoiding political issues connecting to the EZLN, the San Andrés Accords, and the diluted Cocopa law of 2001, many felt these core issues were not being taken seriously by the EC intervention. 
In particular, Prodesis has found it hard to deal with: (i) the delicate issue of "illegal" settlements within the nucleus of the Reserve; (ii) the considerable tensions between ethnic groups; and (iii) the extremely polarized political allegiances that are found in the area. Ensuring participation in project design and management of the Lacandon people, other indigenous groups, and their organisations, was especially difficult. 
Criticism on Prodesis in relation to counter-insurgency or low intensity conflict can be broadly divided along 3 dimensions:
1] in relation to the history of marginalization of indigenous people and landless peasants in Chiapas
2] in relation to the history of social development policy in Chiapas
3] in relation to globalization, Plan Puebla Panama and the European involvement in Prodesis
Many do believe that, under the guise of a development project (aimed at poverty reduction and protecting the environment), Europe's real motive to cooperate in Prodesis would be to secure European trade and investment in Mexico. Since social or political instability (or perceived instability) would pose a threat to the economic partnership, the EU would contribute to a counter-insurgency project. 
This would contradict Prodesis' emphasis on participative democracy. (for a similar argument see also the Zapatista memo). Hence the allegations of a new Conquista by means of neo-liberal policies and direct foreign investment. Communications from the EU itself have encouraged these ideas. Some quotes:
"The Commission wants to create a climate favourable to trade and investment. [...] It is in the EU’s interest to develop and consolidate its market positions and to pursue a dynamic investment policy. [...] The current challenge is to find a way to facilitate trade and European investment in Latin America. The Commission’s aim is to encourage the development of a legal climate to attract European investments and guarantee the predictability and security of these investments In the WTO framework […] contributing to the development of a stable and predictable framework to help the Latin American countries attract more European investment." Strategy for a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America
"There are destabilising factors that could ultimately jeopardize growth and European investments, and thereby affect the biregional partnership. [...] They jeopardise growth and economic development. [...] These relate, in particular to the Chiapas problem and the integration of the marginalized population groups and the country’s indigenous communities in general. These potential instability factors bring with them a cost (lack of security for companies, a distorted image abroad, especially in Europe) and may represent important barriers to the general development of the country, and in particular to attracting European trade and investment." Country Strategy Paper Mexico 2002-2006
Questions about Prodesis in the European Parliament.
26-2-2004: MEP Erik Meijer, question E-0546/04
"Is the Commission aware that, according to the Mexican newspaper La Jornada of 3 February 2004, five non-governmental organisations in the south-eastern state of Chiapas consider the European Union to have been involved in an attack on the village of Nuevo San Rafael, controlled by the Zapatista movement and occupied by members of the Chol tribe, in the remote nature reserve of Montes Azules, which consists of primeval forest, on 19 or 22 January, in which attack 23 houses were set on fire, the occupants fled, the village was permanently cut off from the outside world by soldiers and the land is being returned to the former big land-owners to enable them to fell the primeval forest? [...] Was this attack encouraged by the fact that the EU has concluded an agreement concerning a development project worth € 15.000.000 with governor Pablo Salazar, possibly in part in connection with Plan Puebla Panama, which comprises major infrastructure projects in Central America from Panama to nine poor federal states in Mexico, which require the indigenous Indian population to make way for newcomers and to enable the land to be put to new uses or at least compel that population to give up the autonomy which it in practice enjoys?"
30-3-2004: Commissioner Chris Patten, answer E-0546/04
"The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Mexico states in its first article that the: Respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, underpins the domestic and external policies of both Parties and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement. The Commission at all times ensures that its actions are consistent with this article. The Commission recently signed a Financing Agreement with Mexico for the Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project in Chiapas, Mexico. Implementation of this project has not yet begun, but is
expected to start in the coming months. [...] The project was designed with the input and participation of local stakeholders who will continue to participate in the planning and implementation process, in particular through the Micro-regional Councils (Consejos microregionales) who represent the local communities. The project is not part of the Plan Puebla Panama (PPP). It has been reported that some local communities and governments in the South/Southeast of Mexico criticise the PPP as a top-down initiative with supposedly inadequate consultation of local stakeholders. The Commission is aware of the press reports in question, and considers any suggestion of EU involvement in any act of violence in Chiapas or elsewhere to be utterly without foundation. [...] There is certainly no evidence to suggest that the reported attack was encouraged by the signing of the financing agreement for this project."
6-1-2005: MEP Eva Lichtenberger, question E-3589/04
"Parliament has received news that the indigenous people and those in the rural areas around Montes Azules have not been duly informed about the project and there is a great deal of mistrust. [...] Do the representatives elected to work on the project have Community support? [...] What will happen to communities which refuse to take part in this project? [...] How will support for the project be assessed in this highly militarised and conflictive region? [...] There are many displaced persons in the area of Montes Azules. What connection is there between the above project and a possible relocation of settlements for the displaced?"
24-2-2005: Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, answer E-3589/04 (in French and German [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2004-3589&language=DE)
18-7-2005: MEP Tobias Pflüger, question P-2769/05
"According to press reports and my own local research, those belonging to the indigenous population and farmers living in the Lacandon Jungle region were not adequately informed beforehand about this project, or involved in the planning of the project. Under Article 7 of ILO-convention 169 [http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169], indigenous population groups have to be consulted before projects may be carried out on their lands. According to human rights organisations in Europe and Mexico, the European Commission is running a risk, in financing this project, of lending support to the counter-insurgency action being waged in the context of low-intensity warfare and of exacerbating socio-economic tensions between communities, by virtue of the fact that only certain individual population groups are benefited by this project."
16-2-2006: Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, answer P-2769/05
1) The current Chiapas State Government, elected in 2000, qualified as beneficiary institution in this EC project due to its reconciliatory position in the conflict between federal government and ELZN, that has been recognised by the latter on several occasions. [...] After its election, the Government of Chiapas also politically assumed the principles of the San Andrés Agreement between the federal Mexican government and the EZLN, as well as the 169 ILO Convention.
2) The State Government’s position is sustained by the fact that one of the most delicate subjects in the Lacandona region, the agrarian (land) reform and resulting conflicts over land and delocalisation of “informal settlements” (especially in the Montes Azules area – that is not part of Prodesis’ area of intervention), are falling under federal competence. The Chiapas Government hence is not participating in the very tense negotiations between local communities and federal institutions on that issue.
3) From an institutional point of view, major emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within PRODESIS’ Consultative Council, whose “civil society college” currently includes 30 members of regional and national civil society organisations. The renowned Chiapas expert and EZLN’s external consultant during the negotiation of the San Andres Agreement, Professor Jan de Vos, is also a member of that Consultative Council.
Comments on answer P-2769/05 by Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner
1) Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner refers to the political situation in 2000: Newly elected president Fox had promised to revive the peace process and ratify the Cocopa legislative proposal which, taken to the constitutional level, would mean the fulfillment of the San Andrés Accords. However, in April 2001 Mexican Congress adopted a diluted version of the Cocopa law, which was criticised by the International Labour Organization for violating ILO-convention 169 [http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169]. The EZLN felt betrayed and broke off all dialogue with the federal and state government and installed "juntas de buen gobierno" ("communities of Good governance"). Furthermore, in 2004 Ruben Velazquez Lopez (secretary of government of Chiapas) said he would "not tolerate land-occupations anymore", threatening informal settlements with eviction. So the legitimation the Commissioner gives in her answer of February 16th 2006 conceils the changed political situation between 2000 and 2004, when Prodesis started.
2) The Commissioner suggests that conflicts over land and delocalisation of "informal settlements" happen only in the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which falls under federal competence. Prodesis’ area of intervention is the Lacandon region "around" Montes Azules, which is Chiapas territory. The Chiapas Government (beneficiary of the €15.000.000 for Prodesis), hence would not be involved in these matters. This distinction however is purely theoretical: in reality conflicts over land, para-military attacks, Zapatista presence, and Prodesis' 16 micro-regions are all located in the Lacandon region "around" the Montes Azules Reserve. This is illustrated by this map (see on the right) of Chiapas' Lacandon region, with Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (green area) at the center. The green circles represent Prodesis projects, the blue circles represent areas with conflicts over land, and the red markings represent areas with para-military presence.
3) Although emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within Prodesis’ Consultative Council, several members of that council (among them Jan de Vos and Tim Trench) are critical of Prodesis' consultation process, and sceptical of its effectivity, stating that the project might indeed be worsening the situation in the region.
15-7-2008: MEP Eva Lichtenberger, question H-0628/08
"Why was an extremely strife-torn region chosen without consulting or securing the agreement of the local population? [...] What mechanisms does the EU intend to use in order to guarantee that its projects are carried out in accordance with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples concerning the need to secure free and informed consent for any project being carried out on land belonging to indigenous peoples?"
25-9-2008: Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, answer H-0628/08
"At every step of the project cycle, and even now with PRODESIS in its closing stages, the Commission has been aware of the difficult political and social situation on the ground. This is reflected both by Prodesis' openness to local partner institutions, and its strong commitment to accountability to final beneficiaries and communities. During the feasibility study and formulation mission, there were multiple contacts and consultations with local beneficiaries and communities as well as national and regional civil society organisations. During the project launch and execution, each planning exercise and productive activity financed by the project necessarily depended on the prior agreement and free consent of local communities and grass-root organisations. From an institutional point of view, emphasis has been put on civil society participation and control within the project's Consultative Council, whose independent Civil Society College included approximately 30 members of regional and national Non State Actors (NSA)."

Protocol of Corfu

The Protocol of Corfu (, ), signed on May 17, 1914, was an agreement between the representatives of the Albanian Government and the Provisional Government of Northern Epirus, which officially recognized the area of Northern Epirus as an autonomous self-governing region under the sovereignty of the prince of the newly established Principality of Albania. The agreement granted the Greeks of the districts of Korytsa and Argyrokastro, which form Northern Epirus, wider religious, educational, cultural and political autonomy, inside the borders of the Albanian state.
After the end of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the subsequent peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This turn of events catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace and stability in the region, eventually intervened and the Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol’s terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors.
Background.
During the First Balkan War, the Greek Army defeated the Ottoman forces and pushed north through the region of Epirus, reaching a line from Himara on the Ionian coast east to Prespa Lake by February 1913. Pending the final adjudication of the Great Powers regarding the border between Greece and the newly established state of Albania, the region remained under Greek military control. On 17 December 1913, the Protocol of Florence ceded the northern part of this area, which became known as "Northern Epirus", to Albania. This turn of events was highly unpopular among local Greeks, who decided to declare their independence and secure the region against any opposing threat. The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was thus proclaimed in Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër) on 28 February 1914, with Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished Epirote politician from Lunxhëri, as its head.
Meanwhile, the Greek army evacuated from the region, and, on 1 March, Korytsa (Korçë) was ceded to the newly formed Albanian gendarmerie. Serious disturbances broke out in a number of places between the Autonomist forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars. Meanwhile, an International Commission formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.
Negotiations.
By early May, the Albanian authorities, being unable to suppress the revolt, became willing to start discussions with the intervention of the International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that they were willing to discuss the demands of the Northern Epirote side.
Since incorporation into Greece was not an option after the recent political developments, Zografos proposed three main solutions to the representatives of the International Commission: complete autonomy under the sovereignty of the Albanian prince, administrative and canton type autonomy, and direct administration and control by the European Powers. The Northern Epirote side also demanded the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language to include the regions around Vlorë and Durrës (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of Northern Epirus and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.
The representatives of both sides met for negotiations in Saranda, a coastal town in Northern Epirus, but the final negotiations took place in the nearby island of Corfu, Greece. Finally, on May 17, 1914, the representatives of Northern Epirus and Albania signed an agreement that granted the chief demands of the Epirotes and became known as the Protocol of Corfu. The Protocol is prefaced by a signed agreement of the Commission:
Terms.
[[File:Epirus across Greece Albania4.svg|180px|thumb|right|The region of Epirus, stretching across Greece and Albania.
Legend:
<br>*grey: Approximate extent of Epirus in antiquity
<br>*orange: Greek region of Epirus
<br>*green: Approximate extent of largest concentration of Greeks in "Northern Epirus", early 20th century
The Albanian government, in agreement with the Commission, had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper rank officials, taking into account the demographic composition of the local religious communities. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie, and the prohibition of military levies from non-indigenous people of the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, except for grades one through three. However, religious education would be exclusively in Greek. Moreover, Greek was also made equal to Albanian in all public affairs, including courts and elective councils.
As for the coastal area of Himara, the special autonomous status that it enjoyed during the Ottoman era was renewed, with the addition that a foreigner was to be appointed as its "captain" for 10 years. Moreover, the Protocol stated that the city of Korçë – which was under control of the Albanian gendarmerie – was to come under the Northern Epirote administration. The Great Powers would guarantee the implementation of the terms of the Protocol, while its execution and maintenance was entrusted to the International Control Commission.
Reactions and approval.
On June 1 the Great Powers (including Italy and Austria-Hungary) approved the results of the negotiations and on June 23 the terms of the Protocol were officially approved by the Albanian Government. The Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos advised Georgios Christakis-Zografos to approve the protocol’s terms without asking for even wider autonomy.
The Northern Epirote representatives in the following Panepirotic Assembly of Delvino had to take the final decision on whether to accept the Protocol. The Protocol was eventually accepted after the intervention of Venizelos; however the representatives of Himara found the terms too humiliating, arguing that the only viable solution would be union with Greece and not autonomy inside the Albanian state.
Aftermath.
Political situation and outbreak of World War I.
Soon after the outbreak of World War I (July 1914), the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split into a number of regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus. The Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives. The region was "de facto" annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area.
Interwar Period and Annulment of the Protocol.
In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled during the Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was definitively ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's entrance to the League of Nations, committed itself to protect the rights of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.
The Albanian state led also efforts to establish an independent orthodox church, contrary to the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu and thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the region. According to a 1923 law, priests who were not Albanian speakers, as well as not of Albanian origin, were excluded from this new autocephalous church.
Legacy.
The Protocol of Corfu is often mentioned by Northern Epirote and human rights organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: it is seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.
Notably, during the 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the communist leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question remains one of the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, after the collapse of the communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.

Morison equation

In fluid dynamics the Morison equation is a semi-empirical equation for the inline force on a body in oscillatory flow. It is sometimes called the MOJS equation after all four authors—Morison, O'Brien, Johnson and Schaaf—of the 1950 paper in which the equation was introduced. The Morison equation is used to estimate the wave loads in the design of oil platforms and other offshore structures.
Description.
The Morison equation is the sum of two force components: an inertia force in phase with the local flow acceleration and a drag force proportional to the (signed) square of the instantaneous flow velocity. The inertia force is of the functional form as found in potential flow theory, while the drag force has the form as found for a body placed in a steady flow. In the heuristic approach of Morison, O'Brien, Johnson and Schaaf these two force components, inertia and drag, are simply added to describe the force in an oscillatory flow.
The Morison equation contains two empirical hydrodynamic coefficients—an inertia coefficient and a drag coefficient—which are determined from experimental data. As shown by dimensional analysis and in experiments by Sarpkaya, these coefficients depend in general on the Keulegan–Carpenter number, Reynolds number and surface roughness.
The descriptions given below of the Morison equation are for uni-directional onflow conditions as well as body motion.
Fixed body in an oscillatory flow.
In an oscillatory flow with flow velocity formula_1, the Morison equation gives the inline force parallel to the flow direction:
where
For instance for a circular cylinder of diameter "D" in oscillatory flow, the reference area per unit cylinder length is formula_12 and the cylinder volume per unit cylinder length is formula_13. As a result, formula_3 is the total force per unit cylinder length:
Besides the inline force, there are also oscillatory lift forces perpendicular to the flow direction, due to vortex shedding. These are not covered by the Morison equation, which is only for the inline forces.
Moving body in an oscillatory flow.
In case the body moves as well, with velocity formula_16, the Morison equation becomes:
where the total force contributions are:
Note that the added mass coefficient formula_11 is related to the inertia coefficient formula_19 as formula_10.

1925 Rochester Jeffersons season

The 1925 Rochester Jeffersons season was their sixth and final season in the National Football League. The team improved on their previous record against league opponents of 0–7, losing only six games and logging a tie. They tied for sixteenth in the league.
The previous season saw the culmination of the team's low scoring output, but their woes only improved slightly during the 1925 season. Between 1922 and 1924, the team lost fifteen consecutive NFL games by a combined score of 360–13 (scoring only one touchdown for every 26 that their opponents scored). They were shut out during thirteen of these fifteen NFL games, including a six-game streak being outscored 179–0.
In 1925, though, their scoring output improved, being outscored by a margin of only 111–26. Despite the improvement both on offense and defense, the team finished without a victory for the fourth consecutive season. This streak of 23 games without a victory is topped only by 1976–77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers (26 consecutive losses).
During their six-year existence, the team had logged a record of 8–27–4, with only two victories against teams then in the NFL (45–0 over the Tonawanda Kardex, which turned out to be Tonawanda's only game in the NFL, and 27–13 over the Columbus Panhandles, both during the 1921 season). These two victories were the last the team would experience. The Jeffersons were unable to log a victory over any team currently in the NFL, going 0–5 against the Chicago Cardinals, Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, and New York Giants. 
For the 1925 season, the Jeffersons were coached by Cecil "Tex" Grigg. Grigg also played on the team as a kicker while simultaneously coaching, successfully kicking two extra point attempts during the season. These were his only kicking attempts in his career. The 1925 season was his only year coaching, but Grigg did continue his playing days for two more seasons, one with the New York Giants and one with the Frankford Yellow Jackets. He would go on to play as a running back and scored five touchdowns in his career, including an interception return.
The team, one of the fourteen original teams in the National Football League, ceased operations after the 1925 season. Owner Leo Lyons, one of the founders of the NFL, ran out of money when the Jeffersons failed to draw sufficient crowds to attend their games. Because of a league-sanctioned suspension of operations, the team was still technically in existence through the 1926 and 1927 seasons, but Lyons allowed the franchise to expire on September 15, 1928, nearly three years after the team had played its last game.

Colonial Beacon Gas Station

The Colonial Beacon Gas Station is a historic gas station at 474 Main Street in Stoneham, Massachusetts. It was built c. 1922 by the Colonial Oil Company to be a flagship station in their chain of filling stations. The concrete and stucco building was designed by the Boston firm of Coolidge and Carlson. It has two main sections: an octagonal section that once served as a drive-through filling area, and a rectangular service area to its left. Corinthian columns originally supported the octagonal section; these have since been covered over or replaced. The octagonal section is topped by a round dome, at whose apex is a small pillared section that was once topped by a grillwork globe that housed a light. This light, when illuminated, became the beacon which gives the station its name. The service area and pumping bay have a band of starburst panels that run along the top of the flat roofed service area and around the base of the pumping area dome.
The building served as a filling station until after World War II. Since then it has served a variety of retail services, for example as a flower and produce shop in 1984. None of these uses have significantly affected the integrity of the building. The pumping bay has been enclosed in glass, making it into an integral part of the interior space.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, at which time it was one of four surviving Colonial Oil filling stations. It presently houses an ice cream parlor.

Swedish Floorball Federation ("Swedish: Svenska Innebandyförbundet)" is the governing body of floorball in Sweden. It was founded in Sala, Sweden 7 November 1981 and held its first annual meeting, where all 15 clubs were represented, 20 March 1982. From the season of 1983/84 the Swedish Floorball Federation became a section of the Swedish Hockey Association. After this the interest for floorball in Sweden really started to grow and lots of new clubs were founded. In 1984 there already were over 100 floorball clubs in Sweden. The 22 November 1985 the Swedish Floorball Federation was accepted as an independent association into the Swedish Sports Confederation (Swedish: "Riksidrottsförbundet"). It also was the first sport to get chosen in on the very first application. The head office of the Swedish Floorball Federation is located in Solna (a municipality in Stockholm County). 
Because of the membership in the Swedish sports confederation the development of the sport went faster. A nationwide league launched and the numbers of registered players exploded. 1990 the number of clubs passed 1,000 and had over 25,000 registered players. 1996 the historic first Floorball World Championships were played in Sweden and 15,106 people saw Sweden defeat Finland with 5-0 in Globen, Stockholm. Today there are around 120,000 registered players in Sweden

Man, the State, and War

Man, the State, and War is a 1959 book on international relations by realist academic Kenneth Waltz. The book is influential within international relations for establishing the three 'images of analysis' used to explain conflict in the international system.
Waltz's three images of international relations.
Waltz's initial contribution to the field of international relations was his 1959 book, "Man, the State, and War", which classified theories of the causes of war into three categories, or levels of analysis. Waltz refers to these levels of analysis as "images," and uses the writings of one or more classic political philosophers to outline the major points of each image. Each image is given two chapters: the first mainly uses the classical philosopher's writings to describe what that image says about the cause of war; the second usually consists of Waltz analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of that image.
First image: Individuals.
The first image argues that wars are often caused by the nature of particular statesmen and political leaders such as state leaders -- examples like Napoleon or Saddam Hussein -- or by human nature more generally. This is basically consistent with Classical Realism, which dominated the International Relations discipline at the time of "Man, the State, and War" but which Waltz would contest more fully in his next book, "Theory of International Politics".
Second image: States.
Theories of war that fall under the rubric of Waltz's second image contend that wars are caused by the domestic makeup of states. A prime example that Waltz refers to is Lenin's theory of imperialism, which posits that the main cause of war is rooted in the need for capitalist states to continue opening up new markets in order to perpetuate their economic system at home. A more familiar example in the Western world today is the notion that non-democratic states, because of their internal composition, start wars.
Third image: International system.
Waltz next assesses the first two images as being less influential in general than the third image, yet ultimately necessary in understanding the causes of War. Waltz concludes his 1959 book "Man, the State, and War" with a final explanation of the three images. The third image describing the framework of world politics and the first and second, determining the forces that create the policies of a state. The third image posits that the cause of war is found at the systemic level; namely, that the anarchic structure of the international system is the root cause of war. In this context, "anarchy" is not defined as a condition of chaos or disorder but rather one in which there is no sovereign body that governs the interactions between autonomous nation-states. Put differently, unlike in domestic society where citizens can theoretically rely on law enforcement agencies to protect their persons and property, if a state is invaded and calls "911" it can't be sure anyone will answer. Similarly, whereas when two citizens have a dispute they can appeal to the courts to render a verdict and, more importantly, the law enforcement agencies to enforce the court's ruling, there is no body above nation-states that is capable of: establishing rules or laws for all the states, deciding how these apply in specific cases, and compelling the states to honor the court's ruling. As a result, if an issue at stake is important enough to a state, it can achieve a satisfactory outcome only by using its power to impose its will on another state(s). The realization that, at any point in time any state can resort to armed force, forces each state always be prepared for that contingency. These themes are fleshed out more fully in "Theory of International Politics" which, as the title suggests, lays out a theory for international politics as a whole rather than the narrower focus on what causes war.
