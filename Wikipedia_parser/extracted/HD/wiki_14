<doc id="36572112" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36572112" title="A3 motorway (Albania)">
A3 motorway (Albania)

The Albanian Motorway Road A3 () it is planned to run along the central corridor of Albania from Tirana to southern Albania, whose first part is the Tirana–Elbasan Highway () connecting Tirana with the Pan-European Transport Corridor VIII. This stretch will have 21 viaducts and two tunnels, each with 2.3 kilometers in length named after the 100th Anniversary of Albanian Independence. In the long run, a further construction to Berat (approx. 79 km) and Tepelenë in southern Albanian, is planned.
Route.
According to a press release of the former Transport Minister Sokol Olldashi the construction of the bypass began in March 2011.
The planned A3 motorway begins in the outskirts of Tirana at Rruga Sauk () from the southwest part of Tirana's beltway (), which goes through the Tirana Park on the Artificial Lake. From there, the new road will run about 3 km parallel to the SH3 until they cross it and then transferred into a 550 meter long tunnel.
Afterwards, the highway will run north of the SH3 parallel to this in the valley past the villages of Mullet, and Dobresh Bërzhita until it then swings direction into Krrabë near Mushqeta. After Krrabë, the A3 passes along the border of Tirana and Elbasan counties onto a 2,200 m long tunnel through the Krrabë hills.
After the tunnel and the mountain chain, the highway runs in the valley of the river Kusha towards Elbasan, where it goes through Bradashesh and Shijon and again meets the SH3 and the path from 30.7 km to the end of the new line at the existing roundabout with SH7 the railway-Durrës-Elbasan Rrogozhina Gur-i kuq replaced at km 31.165.
Importance.
The section from Tirana to Elbasan, will be an alternative to the old curvy road SH3. The new highway bypasses the heavy traffic via Durrës-Rrogozhina. In addition, the new track about 15 km shorter than the path to the SH3, resulting in drastically reduced distance with much higher speed between Tirana and Elbasan. Economically, after completion it will be an important link between the Albanian capital and Greece.
Course of construction.
On 29 April 2011 the construction work on the Krrabë tunnel started. It is expected to be ready in March 2013. The end of construction for the entire route from Tirana to Elbasan is projected for June 2013 (18 months construction time).
Costs.
The total cost for the section from Tirana to Elbasan to amount to 440 million euros. The funding is partially taken over by the Islamic Development Bank.

Félix Bonne

Félix Bonne Carcassés (born c. 1939) is a Cuban engineering professor and dissident, best known for his 1997-2000 imprisonment as a member of the pro-democracy "Group of Four".
The Gang of Four.
In 1997, Bonne, Marta Beatriz Roque, Vladimiro Roca, and René Gómez Manzano founded the Internal Dissidence Working Group. They then published a paper titled "The Homeland Belongs to All," which discussed Cuba's human rights situation and called for political and economic reforms. They also called for a boycott of elections in Cuba's one-party system and for investors to avoid Cuba, giving several news conferences to discuss their concerns. A "The Los Angeles Times" columnist described Bonne and Roca's criticism carrying extra weight as "the only known black dissidents in Cuba", stating that "Given Castro's claim that the revolution has ended racial discrimination, he can ill afford to let well-educated blacks challenge him, even as gently as the four defendants had done."
Bonne and the other members of the group were arrested and detained for nineteenth months. They were then tried for sedition in March 1999 in a one-day trial closed to foreign press. Gomez Manzano was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The defendants became known as the "Group of Four". The US, EU, Canada, and the Vatican all called for their release. Amnesty International again declared the four prisoners of conscience, "detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association", and called for their immediate release.
Bonne was released early without explanation on 13 May 2000, having served just under three years in prison. Other members of the Group of Four were released shortly after. In November 2000, the four published another essay, titled "Social Facets", as President Fidel Castro attended a summit in Panama. The essay stated that Cuban education was designed to indoctrinate children, that many children were malnourished from food shortages, and that foreigners in Cuba were allowed privileges—such as cars, computers, and cell phones—that ordinary Cuban people were not.
Later activism.
In July 2005, Bonne was detained in another crackdown on dissidents, again along with Roque and Manzano. He, Roque, and Manzano feuded with Varela Project organizer Oswaldo Payá over the best organization for Cuba's dissident movement; Payá accused them of playing a divisive role and possibly collaborating with state security agents, noting that they had been released from jail far faster than Varela Project members.
On 11 March 2010, Bonne pledged to go on a hunger strike "to the death" if hunger-striking dissident journalist Guillermo Fariñas died from his own fast.

Methylphosphonic acid dichloride

Methyl phosphonic dichloride is an organophosphorus compound. It has a number of potential uses but is most notable as being a precursor to several chemical weapons agents. It is a white crystalline solid, with a low melting point. It hydrolyzes readily and must be handled with care as it is exceedingly toxic. 
Synthesis and reactions.
Methyl phosphonic dichloride is produced by oxidation of methyldichlorophosphine, e.g. with sulfuryl chloride:
It can also be produced from a range of methyl-phosphonates (e.g. dimethyl methylphosphonate) via chlorination with thionyl chloride. Various amines can be used to catalyse this process. 
It reacts with hydrogen fluoride or sodium fluoride to produce methylphosphonyl difluoride, which is used in the production of sarin and soman nerve agents.

Beat the Odds

Beat the Odds is an American game show created by Bill Derman for Bing Crosby Productions.
It first aired as a local production on KTLA in Los Angeles, California in 1961 with Mike Stokey as host and Stan Chambers as announcer. Dennis James succeeded Stokey as host in 1962, and the last episode aired in August 1963. The format was revived for syndication, debuting nationally on December 16, 1968 with Johnny Gilbert as host and Bill Baldwin as announcer. This version of the show lasted until September 1969.
In the show, contestants competed to form words after being given the first letter, last letter, and number of overall letters. For example, if the letters revealed on the two side by side windows on the game board were G and E, and the indicator called for a word of 5 or more letters, "garage" would be an acceptable answer. If a face belonging to a character called "The Whammy" appeared in a window, a player lost their turn. Each correct word won 10 points, with 100 points winning the game.
Bill Carruthers revived the format in 1975, filming a pilot with Chuck Henry as host. This pilot did not sell.

Singarigharutha ceremony

Singarigharutha was the traditional Tai-Ahom ceremony of coronation of the Ahom kings of Assam. During the period of Ahom supremacy in Assam, "Singarigharutha" ceremony had important constitutional significance. In those days it was believed that even though an Ahom prince became king, he could not attain the status of full-fledged monarch until his "Singarigharutha" ceremony was completely performed. Therefore each Ahom rulers after their accession to the throne tried to organize the "Singarigharutha" ceremony as soon as possible. But it was not as easy since the ceremony was very expensive and there were records when some of the Ahom kings had to postpone the ceremony owing to emergency situations or due to financial crisis of the state.
Origin of the Ceremony.
The Singarigharutha ceremony was first observed by the Ahom King Sudangphaa, popularly known as "Bamuni Konwar". Sudangphaa came to throne in 1397 CE. He transferred his capital from Charaideo to Charguwa. In the new capital, Sudangphaa organized the "Singarigharutha" ceremony, a Tai-Ahom ceremony of coronation and claimed the mandate of Heaven to rule the Ahom Kingdom as a descendant of Lengdon or Indra, the Lord of Heaven and Earth. From that time onwards, the following Ahom Kings performed the "Singarigharutha" ceremony as the main event of their coronations. The ceremony was termed as "Singarigharutha" because the woods of Singari tree were used to construct the main platform in which the King used to sit during the procedure of the ceremony. Most of the Ahom rulers preferred to perform the "Singarigharutha" ceremony in Charaideo, which was considered very sacred by the Tai-Ahom community of Assam, since the reign of the first Ahom King Sukaphaa.
The Procedures of the Ceremony.
In order to perform the ceremony, the king, at first, use to consult the Tai-Ahom priests and astrologers, the Deodhai and Bailungs, and an auspicious day was fixed for observing the ceremony. On the day of ceremony, the King, wearing the Somdeo, or image of his tutelary deity, and carrying in his hand the Hengdan or ancestral sword, proceeded on a male elephant, followed by his Chief Queen in a female elephant, to Charaideo, where he planted a pipal tree (ficus religiosa). The royal couple next entered the "Patghar", where the presiding priest poured a libation of water over the King and his Chief Queen. Some Ahom chronicles stated that two person of common origin were selected and placed under the bamboo platform. When consecrated water was poured over the royal couple, the water fell on the persons below. The two persons who were placed under the bamboo platform were presented with gifts of gold and silver coins and then they were exiled far from the Capital, sometime even exiled from the kingdom, as it was believed that all the evil or ill omens of the new King and Queen will leave along with these people. Such people were called Neusa-Jua which literally means the one who takes away the evils or ill omens along with him. It was noted that in olden days descendants of "Neusa-Jua" people were found in Goalpara district. After which the royal couple took their seats in the "Solongghar", on a bamboo platform, under which were placed a man and a specimen of every procurable animal. Consecrated water was poured over the royal couple and fell on the animals below. Then, having been bathed, they entered the "Singarighar" and took their seats on a throne and the leading nobles came up and offered their presents and homage. New money was coined, and gratuities were given to the principal officers of the State and to religious mendicants. The presents to the officers consisted of gold earrings, gold bangles and gold embroidered cloths. "Deodhai-Bailungs" were offered gold earrings, embroidered cloths, girdles, and long clocks, and silver, gold, cowries and cloths to the children and the people at large. On that day, the prisoners convicted with minor crimes were released from the prison. The king and his chief queen use to stay in the "Singarighar" for one full day and night. In the evening, there was a feast in which the king attended with his council of minister and noble. There use to be a custom that when the king sat on the royal throne engraved with dragons, with the image of "Somdeo" hanging down in his neck, the four principal ministers, Burhagohain, Borgohain, Borpatrogohain and Borbarua use to hold the four pillars or supports of the throne, signifying their importance and their support to the king. The image of "Somdeo" was considered very sacred to the Tai-Ahom royalty and very rarely it was exposed to common masses. During the "Singarigharutha" ceremony, the image of Somdeo was shown to the Ahom nobles, to which they use to kneel down nine times. When the king came down from the dragon engraved throne which consisted of nine steps, the ministers and nobles use to salute the king for seven times. After this the king was required to perform sacrifices to the gods. Before the reign of Swargadeo Rudra Singha it had been the custom for the new king, before entering the "Singarighar", to kill a man with his ancestral sword or "Hengdan", but the monarch caused a buffalo to be substituted, and the example thus set was followed by all his successors. When a king is consecrated he attained the status of a full-fledged monarch. The festivities and amusements continued for seven days. On the eighth day, the image of "Somdeo" was returned to its shrine in the manner in which it was first brought and the king returned to the Capital, along with his family and nobles. During the next thirty days the tributary rulers and State officials who had not been present at the installation were expected to come in and do homage and tender their presents to the new king.
Historical Significance of Singarigharutha ceremony.
Singarigharutha ceremony occupied an important place in the history of Ahom Kingdom. Records existed that the Ahom kings and the nobles held special respect and importance to this ceremony. In some religious ceremonies, the rank of the kings who had performed the "Singarigharutha" ceremony and the kings who had not were different. One event which occurred during the reign of Swargadeo Chandrakanta Singha in early 19th century, clearly showed the significance of the "Singarigharutha" ceremony. During Ahom rule in Assam, the "Shraddha" or the death anniversary of the previous Kings were observed annually according to Tai-Ahom traditional rituals. A tribute of rice beer and other items were offered in decorated plates to all the former kings of Ahom kingdom. Chandrakanta Singha visited one of these rituals to offer his respect to the previous Ahom kings. Chandrakanta Singha then noticed that one plate was placed separately from other plates during the religious ceremony. When he enquired about this to the Prime Minister Purnananda Burhagohain, the Premier replied that that plate was offered to Swargadeo Kamaleswar Singha and the reason of placing it in separate rank was because Kamaleswar Singha could not perform the "Singarigharutha" ceremony during his reign due to financial constrain of the State. Therefore Kamaleswar Singha could not be placed in the same rank with the kings who had performed the "Singarigharutha" ceremony. Purnananda Burhagohain also explained that owing to financial constrain the "Singarigharutha" ceremony of Chandrakanta Singha could not be performed at the time of his accession. Chandrakanta Singha became anxious and began to put pressure on the Premier to perform his "Singarigharutha" ceremony, which later became a cause of conflict between the King and the Prime Minister. 
Ambassadors from neighbouring kingdoms of Cachar and Jaintia and representatives of neighbouring hill tribes also visit this occasion to pay their respect to the Ahom monarch. Sometime the ambassadors were granted special privilege to witness the main events of the ceremony along with the festivals and amusements associated with it, as a sign of strengthening the friendly relations with neighbouring kingdoms and tribes.
Conclusion.
Singarigharutha ceremony also signifies the fact that even though the Ahom rulers of Assam adopted Hinduism, the significance of the Tai-Ahom religious customs and practices was still at large during Ahom period. The Tai-Ahom priests and astrologers, the "Deodhais" and the "Bailungs" occupied important position in the Royal court of Ahom kingdom till the very end. It was because of their efforts and influence on the Royal court, Kings and nobles continued to pay their respect to the ancient customs and religious ceremonies of the Tai-Ahom community during the period of Ahom supremacy in Assam.

YMCA Camp Wanakita

YMCA Wanakita is a camp located on Koshlong Lake near Haliburton in central Ontario, Canada. It is run by the YMCA of Hamilton, Burlington and Brantford and attracts campers from throughout Ontario and sometimes internationally. "Wanakita" is an Ojibwa word meaning "let's work together". Wanakita is most active as a residential summer camp, however it also offers day camping, winter camping and family camping. As of 2012, the camp estimates that it has been home to over 200,000 individuals since it was founded in 1953.
History.
Camp Wanakita was designed as a replacement for Erie Heights on Lake Erie which was itself a replacement for Camp Tekahoinwake on the Grand River. Both of these locations were considered too developed so George Jones and co-workers from the YMCA chose Koshlong Lake as the site for Wanakita in 1953. The name "Wanakita" was chosen by Keith Smith. Wanakita began as an all-boys camp and during its early years, the nurse was the only woman who was regularly on the camp grounds. In 1969, the camp started offering the same opportunities to girls. Since 1991, Wanakita has partnered with Hemophilia Ontario and offered instruction on the proper use of clotting agents.
Wanakita originally owned 30 acres of land but has grown to a size of over 1,000 acres. Its largest expansion came from a private donation by a landowner who felt that the camp was a positive presence on Koshlong Lake. For its 50th anniversary in 2003, the camp spent $3 million on landscaping and building additional cabins. This construction provided washrooms to many of the cabin areas that were previously only serviced by kybos. This restructuring allowed Wanakita to run its family camp program all summer long which had previously only been run for one week every summer. Instead of dividing summer campers between the West and East sides, the directors started assigning all summer campers to cabins in the expanded West side, leaving the East side available for families. This decision was controversial among the core audience of residential campers.
One of the staff members most involved with the growth of the camp is Steve Heming whose first experience with the camp came in 1964 at age 10. He continued to return to Wanakita, first as a camper and later as a counsellor and became the general manager during the 1980s. Heming retired in 2010 and passed on his position to Andy Gruppe. In 2011, the camp was given an "Enviro-Hero" award by the Haliburton Highlands Land Trust.
Summer activities.
Campers attending YMCA Wanakita are grouped into cabins. Each cabin has approximately 10 campers from the same age division and 2 counsellors. Letters and emails from parents are periodically delivered and the staff member responsible spends half of each day printing about 250 messages. The cabin stays together during all parts of camp except Personal Choice Activities (PCAs).
A Junior or Intermediate cabin almost always houses a single gender. Cabins for the older participants may or may not be co-ed. Historically the Senior program at Wanakita involved a canoe trip lasting 5 days and 4 nights. Two alternative Senior programs have since emerged — one of them scales back the overnight trip, the other has the trip as the primary focus. The off site trips are held in wilderness areas that have several lakes and may involve a significant amount of portaging. Current destinations are Bon Echo Provincial Park and Magnetawan River.
In order to be a counsellor at Wanakita, one must normally be a Student Counsellor (SC) for two years. To be hired, counsellors must take First Aid and CPR courses and achieve the Bronze Cross. Other positions such as senior counsellors and lifeguards require the full NLS.
Traditions.
YMCA Wanakita encourages returning campers to bond with the newcomers and share their experiences. A longhouse near the camp's entrance maintains a board with the name of every camper who has ever attended. At the beginning of each session, the general manager reads "The Wanakita Challenge". At the end of the session, it is read again to help campers decide whether they lived up to it. When this is done, the YMCA triangle symbol is set on fire.
Meals.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner are eaten in a building between the East and West sides of the camp known as the core. Each cabin has a permanent table in the core set and cleared by a different pair of campers each day. The cooks make enough meals for people to have seconds or thirds if desired. A tuck shop also located in the core sells a limited number of snack items. The camp has started selling the non-edible tuck shop items in an online store. Before each meal, a counsellor chooses a religious or secular grace and leads the camp in singing it. Some graces that get used are "Jonny Appleseed" and "The Eidelweiss Grace" which are in use by other camps that predate Wanakita. After the meal, cabins begin shouting out cheers.
Swimming.
The swimming area has a slide, a basketball net, a water trampoline and an inflatable iceberg. Campers are tested for their swimming ability when they arrive at the camp. Testing is done at a dock that has the shape of an H. The top of the H and the bottom of the H can both be used to swim lengths. At 12.5 metres, the length of the H-dock is around half of the length of a standard pool. 
Campers who take the swimming PCA may earn a Bronze Medallion or Bronze Cross if they stay for a month.
Boating.
A number of boating PCAs are offered with instruction accredited by the Ontario Recreational Canoeing and Kayaking Association. All residential campers are guaranteed to participate in a canoe trip and spend at least one night in a tent away from the camp grounds. For the trips on Koshlong Lake, the counsellor chooses one of ten camp sites that are sufficiently far from cottages and other distractions. Even though Wanakita does not use it for overnight camping, one of the most popular destinations is Jumper's Rock, a cliff located 6 metres above deep water. Cabins carry out the tripping in standard canoes that hold four people but Wanakita also has two war canoes holding ten.
Other.
Other options in Wanakita's list of activities are mountain biking, court sports, field sports, rock climbing, arts and crafts, paddle making, theatre, wilderness education, acoustic guitar and archery. Morning dip is an optional undertaking that awards a badge to those who run into the lake. Wanakita also has a mob justice system called Kangaroo Court or Kangaroo Kourt (the spelling is not consistent). If a camper or counsellor plays a prank or breaks a minor rule, the incident can be reported to the head of the camp. If it is deemed sufficiently humorous, it will be the subject of a Kangaroo Court case. A harsher sentence is having to swim in the swamp. A meal time rule at Wanakita is "take what you need, but eat what you take". The extent to which this should be enforced is a frequent debate topic in Kangaroo Kourt.

The Sea Lady

The Sea Lady is a fantasy novel written by H. G. Wells that has some of the aspects of a fable. It was serialized from July to December 1901 in "Pearson's Magazine" before being published as a volume by Methuen. The inspiration for the novel was Wells's glimpse of May Nisbet, the daughter of the "Times" drama critic, in a bathing suit, when she came to visit at Sandgate, Wells having agreed to pay her school fees after her father's death.
Plot.
The intricately narrated story involves a mermaid who comes ashore on the southern coast of England in 1899. Feigning a desire to become part of genteel society, the mermaid's real design is to seduce Chatteris, a man she saw "some years ago" in "the South Seas—near Tonga," who has taken her fancy. This she reveals in a conversation with the narrator's second cousin Melville, a friend of the family that adopts Miss Waters. As a supernatural being she is unimpressed with the fact that Chatteris is engaged to a Miss Glendower and is trying to make amends for his wastrel youth by entering politics. Chatteris is unable to resist the mermaid's alluring charms, though succumbing means his death.
Themes.
Couched in the language of fantasy and romance that blends with light-hearted social satire, "The Sea Lady" explores serious themes of nature, sex, the imagination, and the ideal in an Edwardian world in which moral restraints are loosening. Wells wrote in "Experiment in Autobiography" that "The Sea Lady" reflected his "craving for some lovelier experience than life had yet given me."
In its narrative structure, "The Sea Lady" plays cleverly with conventions of historical and journalistic research and verification.

Utsunoya Pass

The is a pass on the old Tōkaidō highway connecting the capital of Edo with Kyoto. Located between former Mariko-juku in what is now Aoi-ku, Shizuoka, and Okabe-juku in what is now Fujieda, it is the only portion of the Heian period road known to have survived to the present day, and was proclaimed a National Historic Site on February 22, 2010.
The route of the ancient Tōkaidō highway skirted the coast of Suruga Bay during the Nara period. However, due to the rugged coastline in the area, the route was shifted inland to the Utsunoya-tōge during the Heian period. Mention of the pass is made frequently in Heian-period "waka" poetry, with references to the narrow road and the sound of Japanese Bush Warblers in the area. However, during the 1590 Battle of Odawara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the route of the Tōkaidō to be shifted slightly to its present course, which offered less of a bottleneck to his armies. The Edo period Tōkaidō followed this new route, and the Heian period pathway was forgotten until rediscovered in 1965.
During the Meiji period, a modern tunnel was dug under the Utsunoya-tōge. Completed in 1876, it was the first tunnel in Japan to charge a toll for passage. The tunnel was in use until closed by a fire 1896, but was reopened from 1904-1930. Made obsolete by automobiles, the original tunnel was replaced in 1930 by a larger tunnel, and a second tunnel was added in 1959. The 1930 tunnel is used by Shizuoka Prefectural Road 208, and the 1959 tunnel by Japan National Route 1.
Due to ever increasing traffic, the Heisei Utsunoya-tōge Tunnel was completed in 1990 on the Okabe Bypass of Japan National Route 1.

Kashmirosaurus

Kashmirosaurus is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian known from Permo-Carboniferous deposits in the region of Kashmir. It was originally named by English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward in 1905 as a species of "Archegosaurus" called "Archegosaurus ornatus". More recently, the species has been recognized as being distinct from "Archegosaurus", and it was placed in its own genus "Kashmirosaurus" in 1996. An additional species of "Archegosaurus", "A. kashmiriensis", was named in 1960 from the same deposits in Kashmir, and is now considered synonymous with "Kashmirosaurus ornatus".

Shijimizuka site

The is a late Jōmon archaeological site in Naka-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan., inhabited from approximately 2000 BC – 1000 BC. 
The existence of a number of large shell middens containing millions of shells of freshwater bivalve clams was noted in mid-Edo period records. A portion of the site was destroyed by local farmers mining it for fertilizer in the 1830s. However, with the excavation of the Ōmori Shell Middens by Edward S. Morse of the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877, due academic attention became focussed on the Hamamatsu site, and preliminary investigations were conducted by Tokyo University in 1889. These investigations recovered earthenware fragments and stone tools, and confirmed that the site dated from the Jōmon period. 
Subsequent excavations in 1895 and 1915 uncovered human bones, as well as necklaces and bracelets made from shells. The bones of deer and wild boar were also found. Later excavations were conducted by Kyoto Imperial University in 1920-1922 uncovered the foundations of twenty Pit dwellings. 
The site was further explored using modern methods by the University of Shizuoka from 1954-1955 and in 1983. Many of the artifacts, which included iron arrowheads, jewelry and pottery, are on display at the nearby Hamamatsu City Museum.
At present, the shell midden is divided into four parts. One part is preserved with the cross-section on display to a depth of approximately 1.5 meters, indicating habitation of the site for approximately 1000 years. In addition to the shells and animal bones, the bones of various saltwater fish have been discovered, indicating that the site was rich in both marine and forest resources.
In 1959, the site was designated a National Historic Site and was opened to the public as a historical ruins park. A number of the pit dwellings have been reconstructed. The site also preserves a late-19th-century farmhouse.

Francis Marion Walker

Francis Marion Walker (November 12, 1827 – July 22, 1864) was a Confederate States Army colonel during the American Civil War (Civil War). He was killed while commanding a brigade at the Battle of Atlanta of July 22, 1864, one day before his commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army was delivered.
Early life.
Francis Marion Walker was born in Paris, Kentucky on November 12, 1827. His parents were John and Tabitha (Taylor) Walker. Walker's mother died while he was young. In 1843, the Walker family moved to Hawkins County in east Tennessee, where his father was proprietor of a tavern. Walker had a limited formal education but taught school for his own education and to earn money for college tuition.
Walker was elected second lieutenant in the 5th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, commanded by his father as colonel, during the Mexican-American War. The unit was sent to Mexico but the war was over before it could be sent into action.
Walker graduated with honors from Transylvania University in 1850. He established a law practice in Rogersville, Tennessee. In 1854, he moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee and set up a law practice. He was a Chattanooga alderman in 1858–1859 and attorney general of the Tennessee Fourth District from 1860 until the start of the Civil War.
Walker had a prominent son, Lapsley Greene Walker, a Chattanooga newspaperman who opposed the Ku Klux Klan.
American Civil War service.
Walker was actually a committed Unionist and made speeches in support of the Union in eastern Tennessee before Tennessee declared its secession from the Union. After Tennessee joined the Confederacy, Walker decided to stay with his State and joined the Confederate cause. He became captain of the "Marsh Blues" of Hamilton County, Tennessee, which became Company I of the 19th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. The company was named for Ed Marsh, a local man who provided uniforms and equipment. Walker was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the regiment on June 11, 1861.
Walker's regiment fought at the Battle of Mill Springs and Battle of Shiloh where both the unit and Walker were praised for bravery. Walker was elected colonel of the 19th Tennessee Infantry on May 8, 1862. Thereafter, he led the regiment at the Battle of Stone's River, Battle of Chickamauga and in the Chattanooga Campaign. The regiment fought during the Atlanta campaign. Fighting from trenches, they decimated the soldiers of a Union assault at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, 1864.
Brigade commander, Brigadier General Otho F. Strahl and corps commander, Lieutenant General William J. Hardee repeatedly recommended that Walker be promoted to brigadier general. In June 1864, Walker was given command of a brigade in Major General Benjamin F. Cheatham's division when Brigadier General George Maney was promoted to division command.
On July 17, 1864, just before the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis replaced General Joseph E. Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee defending Atlanta with the aggressive Lieutenant General, temporary General, John Bell Hood. On July 22, 1864, Hood ordered Lieutenant General Hardee to maneuver around the left flank of the Union Army east of Atlanta for a surprise attack while Major General Cheatham, then in command of Hood's former corps, was to make a diversionary attack on the front of the Union force and the cavalry commander, Major General Joseph Wheeler, would attack their supply line. The Battle of Atlanta, fought east and south of the city and near the Union supply lines further east at Decatur, Georgia, ensued. During a hard day of fighting after a night march to get into position, Hardee's men succeeded in bending back the Union left flank and retaking some breastworks that had been built by the Confederates earlier. Union Major General James B. McPherson, who was killed during the battle, anticipated the Confederate maneuver against the far end of his flank, reshaped his line and sent reinforcements to the flank.
By 5:00 p.m., Confederate advances along the Union front had been reversed although the Union force had lost a large part of the left, or southern, part of their line. Still part of the XVII Corps under Major General Francis Preston Blair, Jr. still held a position anchored on Bald Hill. Confederate Major General Patrick Cleburne, operating under Hardee, gathered available forces in the area to make a large assault against the Union position on Bald Hill. Blair meanwhile had thought the Confederate effort had been spent and even suggested in a message to Union Army commander Major General William T. Sherman that with another brigade he could retake the lost ground.
Francis M. Walker's men, which included his 19th Tennessee Infantry as well as Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00 p.m. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half the number of men but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who was waving his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade was hit with a tremendous volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received written notification of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack to try to take a Union battery and suffered severe casualties. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort at the top of the hill. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.
Although Walker could have acted as a brigadier general from the receipt of the commission, he still would not have officially and legally been a brigadier general until after his appointment had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate. The Confederate Senate had not confirmed the appointment as of the date of Walker's death.
Aftermath.
Walker initially was buried in Citizens Cemetery at Griffin, Georgia. His remains were reinterred in a family plot in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1889.

Marika Koroibete

Marika Koroibete (born 26 July 1992) is a Fijian professional rugby league footballer for the Melbourne Storm of the National Rugby League. He primarily plays wing. Some pundits consider him the fastest player in the NRL.
Playing career.
Born in Navaiyawa, Fiji, Koroibete grew upon a family farm from which he walked twenty kilometres to travel to and from school. He played his junior football for his school in Fiji before signing a 3-year contract with the Wests Tigers. He was signed after being spotted playing for the Fiji Under 19s in a match against Australian-born Fijian players. At around the same time he was considered a possibility for a career in sprinting, having run 100 metres in 10.75 seconds.
Koroibete played for the Tigers' Toyota Cup team in 2011 and 2012, scoring 22 tries in 26 games. He scored two tries as the team won the 2012 Grand Final. 2012 Toyota Cup coach Todd Payten said, "The most exciting part with Marika is that we're only really scratching the surface. He's got a couple of little issues and once we iron them out, he's certainly going to be a crowd pleaser."
In Round 21 of the 2012 NRL season, Koroibete made his NRL debut for the Tigers against the South Sydney Rabbitohs. In just his second game, Koroibete scored 4 tries against the Parramatta Eels, equalling the club record for most tries in a match set by Kevin McGuinness ten years earlier. He followed this up with 2 tries against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs a fortnight later. Coach Tim Sheens described him as having, "lots of issues still but he's got raw pace and ability."
On 21 August 2012, Koroibete was named at wing in the 2012 Toyota Cup Team of the Year. He was also named the joint Rookie of the Year for the Wests Tigers, and one of the top ten upcoming youngsters in the NRL in Lifestyle Uncut Magazine.
A number of injuries, including a fractured eye-socket and a dislocated elbow, saw Koroibete play in just 9 games in 2013. However, he scored 5 tries and was averaging over three tackle breaks and 100 metres with the ball per game.
Koroibete made his international debut for Fiji in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, as Fiji defeated Ireland 32-14. He played in all five of Fiji's games. In the game against Samoa, he made seven tackle breaks and ran over 220 metres with the ball.
In May 2014, Marika played for Fiji in the 2014 Pacific Rugby League International.
On 23 June 2014, Koroibete joined the Melbourne Storm mid-season on a 2-and-a-half-year contract effective immediately.

Taiwan's Q1 2013 economic growth.
Commenting on Taiwan's Q1 2013 economic growth at 1.54%, way lower than the forecast value of 3.26%, Kuan said that he was surprised that this was due to the low consumption by private sectors in Taiwan. He added that CEPD aimed for Taiwan's 4% overall economic growth in 2013, although it might be impossible knowing that Taiwan will need a straight 5% economic growth for the remaining quarters of the year. However, he added that investments in private sectors are still rising, an indication of a positive economic outlook.

Wiggins played in college at the University of Kansas. He is the second ever Canadian basketball player to be taken #1 overall in the NBA draft. His talent and athleticism have drawn comparisons to Tracy McGrady.
Early life.
Wiggins was born in Toronto, Ontario and raised in nearby Vaughan, Ontario. He is the son of former NBA player Mitchell Wiggins, an American, and former Olympic track and field sprinter Marita Payne-Wiggins, a Canadian who is originally from Barbados. His parents met as student-athletes at Florida State University.
High school career.
Wiggins attended Vaughan Secondary School in Vaughan for two years before transferring to Huntington Prep School in Huntington, West Virginia in 2011.
Wiggins had been rated as the top prospect for 2014, but announced in October 2012 that he would officially reclassify into his original high school class of 2013, and was immediately placed ahead of the previous number one prospect, Jabari Parker, by ESPN.
On February 7, 2013, after an article in "Sports Illustrated" criticized Canadian basketball and Wiggins' work ethic, he responded later that day, scoring 57 points in a 111–59 win over Marietta College.
Wiggins was named the 2013 Naismith Prep Player of the Year on February 25. He was named the 2013 Gatorade National Player of the Year on March 28 as the nation's top high school player. He was the first Canadian player to be so named. In May 2013, he was named Mr. Basketball USA. He was ranked number one high school basketball player by "SLAM Magazine".
In April 2013, Wiggins played in the Jordan Brand Classic All-American game in Brooklyn. He scored 19 points and tied Julius Randle for lead scorer for the East team.
College career.
Wiggins committed to the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team on May 14, 2013. Before the announcement, he had narrowed his choices to Florida State University, the University of Kentucky, the University of Kansas and the University of North Carolina. Wiggins joined the Kansas team on June 19, 2013.
On January 13, 2014, Wiggins scored 17 points and collected 19 rebounds in a 77–70 victory over Iowa State, becoming only the second freshman in the last 15 years (along with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist) to amass those numbers in a win against a ranked opponent. 
Wiggins averaged 17.1 points per game (ppg), 5.9 rebounds per game (rpg), and made 34.1% of his three-pointers in his freshman year at Kansas. On January 22, 2014, Wiggins was named a Top 25 Finalist for the John R. Wooden Men's Player of the Year award by the Los Angeles Athletic Club. On February 28, he was named one of the 10 semi-finalists for Naismith College Player of the Year.
On March 8, 2014, Wiggins scored 41 points against West Virginia, the most for a Big 12 Conference freshman since Michael Beasley scored 44 points against Baylor in 2008.
Professional career.
NBA Draft.

He was picked number one overall in the draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers on June 26, 2014.
International career.
Wiggins participated in the 2010 FIBA Under-17 World Championship and 2012 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship, assisting the Canadian national team's win of a bronze medal in each tournament. During the 2010 victory, Wiggins was a teammate of Anthony Bennett, the number one overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft and future teammate on the Cavaliers. In the 2012 tournament, he led the team in scoring with 15.2 ppg, along with 7.6 rpg.

Guni-Guni

Guni-Guni is a 2012 Filipino horror film under Regal Entertainment. It stars Lovi Poe and Benjamin Alves. The film is directed by Tara Illenberger. 
Background and development.
The film was first announced by Regal Entertainment in March 30, 2012 along with 11 other films they are going to release this year. Originally, the lead role was offered to Jennylyn Mercado but she turned down the role due to her busy schedule, making another Regal Film and a drama series under GMA Network.

The new GMA 7's contract artist Benjamin Alves signed for the lead man role making the film his first lead role in a movie outfit.The film began shooting in May 28, 2012.
Plot.
Thirty years ago, an unborn child was buried in the garden of what is now a boardinghouse in Cubao. It lies beneath the ground, unbeknownst to the tenants who live there. One of the tenants is Mylene (Lovi Poe) who appears like the perfect girl, nice, pretty and at the top of her Medicine class. But nobody knows about her past, not even the man who loves her most, Paolo (Benjamin Alvez). Paolo doesn't know anything about Mylene's family, her long, lost sibling or her estranged, nervous wreck of a mother. Nor does he know about the very long scar that runs across Mylene's body, nor of how incomplete she always feels. And he finds that the more he tries to win back her love, the more she retreats to her secret world that nobody could enter.
One day Mylene asked to perform an abortion for fee, she feels conflicted about doing what' is right and, at the same time, being in dire need of tuition fee. Her decision ultimately leads to a dark outcome and awakens a force that has laid quiet for years in the boardinghouse grounds. Thereafter, she becomes tormented by nightmares of a dark twin, whose presence gets stronger as days pass, as strange things start to happen in the house. When one by one, the boarders die of unexplainable causes, Joanna (Empress Shuck) the resident psychic and Mylene's best friend struggles to understand the impending danger that she senses and decides to get to the bottom of the mystery; and as it unravels, they find themselves confronted by an angry soul that seeks justice.

<doc id="36573213" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36573213" title="Rob Saxton">
Rob Saxton

Rob Saxton currently serves as the first Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction in the State of Oregon. His appointment follows significant restructuring of the state education bureaucracy. Saxton previously served as the Superintendent of Tigard-Tualatin School District, which covers a suburb of Oregon's largest city.
School District Administrator.
Saxton started his career in education as a teacher and football coach in Big Spring, Texas. He returned to his home state after accepting a job teaching in Albany, Oregon. Rob's first administrative position was at West Albany High. He later held school administrative posts in nearby districts of McMinnville, Oregon and Sherwood, Oregon. Following this, he took the post as leader of the Tigard-Tualatin schools. With around 13,000 students, that district has shown marked improvement under Saxton's tenure. One area of particular focus for Saxton was closing the gap between minority students and the statewide averages in reading and mathematics. Colleagues also note his keen focus on early literacy and reducing inappropriate special education classifications. He acted as superintendent in Tigard-Tualatin for seven years before being appointed to statewide office.
Statewide Official.
Restructuring.
For nearly 150 years, the highest education office in Oregon was the Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction. However, Governor John Kitzhaber was elected in 2010 on a platform of reforming the education system. Therefore, at his direction the Oregon legislature passed major changes to the central administration of the Oregon Department of Education. One effect was the designation of the governor himself as Superintendent of Public Instruction. He then was to appoint a Deputy Superintendent to care for the day-to-day operation of the public school system. There is no longer an elected statewide Superintendent. This change was reportedly intended to give the governor stronger oversight of the education system.
At the same time, a new office was created, the Oregon Chief Educational Officer. This office oversees all educational programs in Oregon, including preschool (Head Start), K-12 public schools, community colleges, and universities. Previously these educational institutions had been only connected in a loose sense. This new position is designed to provide budget and mission unification. Therefore, the position of Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction reports to the Chief Educational Officer in the first instance, and then to the governor. The Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction is a professional-level position, as opposed to an elected position, and therefore pays about three times the salary of the previous Superintendent of Public Instruction position. The Deputy Superintendent will continue in the role of the now-defunct Superintendent as head of the Oregon Department of Education, which oversees K-12 school standards.
Appointment.
Saxton was announced for the statewide oversight position by Governor Kitzhaber on July 12, 2012. He becomes the first ever non-elected leader of Oregon's public schools. Kitzhaber indicated that Saxton's significant experience as Tigard-Tualatin superintendent was a key factor in his selection. After the appointment of Rudy Crew as Chief Education Officer, Saxton was the second top-level appointment in Kitzhaber's new education bureaucracy. The reforms were set to transfer the position from elected to appointed with the expiration of Susan Castillo's term as Superintendent. However, her early resignation created the vacancy filled by Saxton. Saxton takes up the role in an official capacity as of July 31, 2012. However, to continue on a permanent basis, his appointment must be confirmed by the Oregon legislature, which does not sit again until fall of 2012.
Goals.
The Department of Education in Oregon helps guide the more than 1,200 public schools in the state. The key roles of the agency include setting test standards and graduation requirements for statewide uniformity. This gives Saxton a wide latitude to influence pupil performance. Saxton has indicated that he intends to make the department focused, not only on legal requirements, but on offering a base of resources to local school districts. Saxton has a background in education lobbying, developed while serving as school administrator. However, he indicated a desire to learn more about the department before implementing any bold new initiatives.

Route des Crêtes

Route des Crêtes () is an road in the Vosges Mountains in eastern France, which passes through the Parc Naturel Régional des Ballons des Vosges. It connects Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (north) with Cernay (south) and runs on the border of the departements of Haut-Rhin (68) and Vosges (88). Most of the route is at an elevation in excess of , with the highest point being at the Col du Grand Ballon (). The road is generally open from April to November, but most of the route is closed in the winter by snow.
History.
The ridge forms part of the boundary between the Alsace and Lorraine regions of France. In 1871, Alsace was ceded to Germany under the Treaty of Frankfurt, and thus the ridge formed the boundary between France and Germany.
During the First World War, the French military decided to create a road to follow the ridge, thus allowing easier access to the valleys on both sides, enabling the faster movement of French troops. The route was mostly just below the ridge to the west and was thus protected from German gunfire.
Description of route.
From Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (Haut-Rhin) (elevation ), the Route des Crêtes is accessed via D48 and Col des Bagenelles (), which leads to the Col du Bonhomme (), on the route connecting Saint-Dié-des-Vosges (west) and Colmar (east). 
The route (now D148) continues south via the Col de Louchbach () to the Col de Calvaire (), where it enters the department of Vosges. The route (now D61) then passes the Gazon du Faing () from where there is a panoramic view stretching to the Black Forest across the Rhine valley in Germany and the Hohneck, Petit Ballon and Grand Ballon summits in the Vosges mountains. 
From here the road then crosses the Col de la Schlucht (), which connects Gérardmer (west) with Colmar. Near here, there is the Jardin d'altitude du Haut Chitelet. Now the D430, the road then passes the Hohneck mountain () from where there are also panoramic views.
After passing the Kastelberg (), Rainkopf () and Rotherbachkopf () peaks in quick succession, the road returns to the Haut-Rhin department before it crosses the Cols du Herrenberg () and Hahnenbrunnen () on the way to the winter resort of Le Markstein (). 
The road (now D431) then reaches its highest point at the Col du Grand Ballon (), before passing the Col Amic () on the descent to Cernay. En route, it passes the ruins of Freundstein Chateau, which at an altitude of is the highest castle in Alsace, and the Hartmannswillerkopf military cemetery at Vieil Armand.
Traffic management.
The route has become popular with walkers, cyclists, motorbikers and motorcaravanners. In 2000, a shuttle bus was introduced to carry walkers onto the ridge road in an attempt to reduce the pressure from the use of cars; this was not successful and the bus service was withdrawn in 2012. In 2008, a comprehensive report on the traffic problems was published by the park authority. Environmental groups were calling for partial closure of the road to prevent over-crowding especially during summer weekends, which often resulted in road accidents. The report's author, J.-P. Monet considered the conflicting environmental and economic issues. His report offered no real solutions but concluded:Je souhaite aux acteurs . . . de trouver le chemin de la concertation et d’arriver à créer un réseau coopératif leur permettant de valoriser ce magnifique site dans un climat apaisé. (I hope the players can find the path of dialogue and create a cooperative network allowing them to develop this wonderful site in a peaceful climate.)
With effect from 1 May 2012, a speed limit of 70 km/h was introduced on the sections of the road in the Haut-Rhin department, between the Col des Bagenelles and Uffholtz (near Cernay). At present, a similar speed limit has not been imposed by the Vosges department covering the central section of the route. A proposal has also been put forward to close the road entirely to motor vehicles, other than public transport, on at least one day a week.

<doc id="36573228" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36573228" title="Flavius Optatus">
Flavius Optatus

Flavius Optatus (died September AD 337) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 334. He was possibly related to the emperor Constantine I.
Biography.
Optatus was originally a rhetoritician (or as characterised by Libanius, a “teacher of letters”) who was the tutor to Licinius the Younger, the son of the emperor Licinius. Libanius alleged that after the fall of Licinius in AD 324, Optatus owed his continued favour at the imperial court through the influence of his wife, who was willing to bestow her favours in order to help Optatus advance his career.
Optatus was one of the first who was granted the rejuvenated title of "Patricius" by the emperor Constantine I, perhaps a sign of the change in his social status at the court, or perhaps a recognition of his familial ties with the imperial family. He apparently managed to become quite wealthy through his career at the imperial court, and he was eventually appointed "consul prior" alongside Amnius Anicius Paulinus in AD 334. Optatus died in AD 337 in the purge of the imperial family and court by the sons of Constantine which saw the deaths of Julius Constantius and Dalmatius.
Optatus had a wife, who was the daughter of an innkeeper from Paphlagonia, and thus may have been a relative of Constantine’s mother, Helena. He also had two brothers-in-law, one of whom was the father of Saint Optatus.

2012 Yahoo! Voices hack

Yahoo! Voices, formerly Associated Content, was hacked in July, 2012. The hack is supposed to have leaked approximately half a million email addresses and passwords associated with Yahoo! Contributor Network. The suspected hacker group, D33ds, used a method of SQL Injection to penetrate Yahoo! Voice servers. Security experts said that the passwords were not encrypted and the website did not use a HTTPS Protocol, which was one of the major reasons of the data breach. Dana Lengkeek, a Yahoo! spokeswoman, was asked about the companies whose credentials were stolen, but Mrs Lengkeek did not respond. The email addresses and passwords are still available to download in a plaintext file in the hacker's website. The hacker group described the hack as a "wake-up call" for Yahoo! security experts. Joseph Bonneau, a security researcher and a former product analysis manager at Yahoo, said "Yahoo can fairly be criticized in this case for not integrating the Associated Content accounts more quickly into the general Yahoo login system, for which I can tell you that password protection is much stronger"
Reaction by communities and users.
D33DS, the hacker group, said that the hack was a "wake-up call". They said that it was not a threat to Yahoo!, Inc. The IT Security firm, TrustedSec.net, said that the passwords contained a number of email addresses from Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, and more such websites. Yahoo Voice, was a subdomain of Yahoo. The attacker mistakenly forgot to remove the hostname "dbb1.ac.bf1.yahoo.com".
Response from Yahoo.
Immediately after the hack, Yahoo!, in a written statement, apologized for the breach. Yahoo did not disclose how many passwords were valid after the hack, because they said that every minute, 1-3 passwords are changed on their site. Yahoo said that only 5% of its passwords were stolen during the hack. The hackers website, d33ds.co, was not available later on Thursday, after the hack. Yahoo said in a written statement that it takes security very seriously and is working together to fix the vulnerability in its site. Yahoo said that it was in the process of changing the passwords of the hacked accounts and notifying other companies of the hack. They said that some of the passwords stored in the database were registered in 2006.
Controversy.
A simple matter had sparked a controversy over Yahoo!. The controversy was sparked because of Yahoo's silence about the data breach. After the servers were hacked, Yahoo! did not mail the affected 450,000 victims, though it was promised earlier. There was no site-wide notifications about the hack, nor did any victim get any type of personal messages detailing how to reset their account passwords from Yahoo.

List of regions of Saxony

A classification of the various regions of Saxony cannot be achieved in any uniform or standard way, as the commonly used names usually represent a mixture of historical regions and geographical features. Many well-known names of regions, such as Lusatia, comprise a mixture of natural habitats and geological zones, while other, scientifically assigned, names are only known in university departments.
The following list contains, in alphabetical order, both those names that are commonly used, as well as those only known regionally or used in the scientific field. They are listed by their English names with their German names in brackets. Names of settlements or other geographic features are omitted here.
Overall, across much of the area, Saxony belongs both to Eastern Germany and Central Germany. However, on a smaller scale there are many regions and landscapes that overlap the boundaries of the Free State and extend beyond it:

Diane Nukuri

Diane Nukuri-Johnson (born December 1, 1984 in Kigozi-Mukike) is a Burundian professional distance runner. She competed for Burundi in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the 5,000m and in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London in the marathon. Nukuri-Johnson ran for The University of Iowa in college.
Early life.
Nukuri began running in her early teens, starting little more than a year prior to her first Olympic experience (the 2000 Olympics in Sydney). She ran in the junior IAAF World Cross Country Championships twice, placing 18th in 2000 and 27th the following year. She won the bronze medal in the 10,000 meters at the 2001 Francophone Games in Ottawa, Canada. After the games, Nukuri fled to Toronto, seeking asylum from the Burundi civil war. At the time, Nukuri-Johnson had already lost her father to the conflict, and she knew she would have no running career had she stayed in Burundi. She was granted asylum, and lived with relatives in Pickering, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto.
The University of Iowa and Butler CCC.
Nukuri-Johnson continued to run while living in Canada, and began drawing interest from cross country and distance track coaches from American universities, in particular The University of Iowa. However, Nukuri-Johnson spoke very little English, so she attended Butler County Community College in El Dorado, Kansas. At Butler, Nukuri-Johnson trained under Kirk Hunter while learning English (her third language), taking classes, and amassing 9 NJCAA national championships and 17 NJCAA All-American honors. After two seasons at Butler, Nukuri-Johnson transferred to The University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa to work with coach Layne Anderson, who recruited Diane directly out of high school. Anderson was largely responsible for Nukuri-Johnson attending Butler. 
In her time at Iowa, Nukuri won two Big Ten Championships, in cross-country (2007) and the 5,000 meters in outdoor track (2008). She was named an All-American three times and won the Wilma Rudolph student-athlete award. She left Iowa with school records in ten events. 
In her final collegiate race (the NCAA Championships, 10,000 meters), a major side stitch forced Nukuri-Johnson into an early exit with only a few laps remaining while in second place. She graduated from Iowa with a Bachelor's Degree in Communications in the fall of 2008. She met her husband while studying at the university, marrying approximately two years later.
Professional career.
She competed in her first professional race at the 2008 Shelter Island 10K. Major race performances are below.
Nukuri-Johnson first competed in the Olympics at the age of 15, running the 5,000 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She finished 14th in her heat but did not advance to the finals. She returned to the Olympics twelve years later, competing in the women's marathon. She finished in 31st place, setting another Burundian National Record (she owned the previous mark in the marathon) in 2:30:13. 118 runners started the race, and 107 finished. Nukuri-Johnson was also the flag-bearer for Burundi, leading the country's six athletes at the opening ceremony. Nukuri-Johnson also carried the flag in Sydney.
She bettered her national record at the NYC Half Marathon in March 2013, narrowly finishing second to Caroline Rotich in a time of 1:09:12 hours.
Nukuri-Johnson is currently the Burundian record-holder in the 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters, half marathon, and the marathon. She continues training in Iowa City with Coach Anderson.
Her story has been documented in a number of articles, including "Running Times" in October 2012.
Personal life.
Nukuri-Johnson lives in Iowa City, Iowa with her husband.

Auguste Barbereau

Mathurin Auguste Balthasar Barbereau (b. 14 November 1799 in Paris – d. 14 July 1879 ibid) was a French composer and music theorist. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1810 and was awarded numerous times. He was awarded with the Prix de Rome in 1824 for his cantata "Agnes Sorel," with text by Pierre-Ange Vieillard, publishing it shortly thereafter. He conducted many orchestras in several theaters, especially the "Teatre Italià" between 1836-38. 
Many times he replaced Anton Reicha, who had been his teacher in the class of composition of the Conservatory. Among his disciples are Ambroise Thomas and Ernest Guiraud. He wrote the score of the opera "Les Sybarites de Florence," and took part in a variety of symphonies and concert works, but the real contribution of Barbereau is his theoretical work, among them his "Traité d'harmonie Theoretical et pratique" (1843-1845), considered the most important scientific work published hitherto on this subject. After this work he published a curious "Etude sur l'origine du système musical" (Paris, 1852), which gave rise to great controversy. Auguste Barbereau died suddenly in an omnibus in Paris, after he had been teaching at the Conservatory.

First Steps (Elbow song)

"First Steps" is a song composed and recorded by Elbow as the BBC's theme for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Production history.
The BBC invited Elbow to present ideas for the 2012 Olympic theme, on the strength of their 2008 song "One Day Like This", which had been used during the Beijing Olympics and televising of subsequent sporting events. 
In November 2011 it was announced that the BBC had commissioned Elbow to composing the theme music. The six-minute anthem was recorded with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and the NovaVox gospel choir. 
The anthemic composition and the accompanying visuals were intended to sum up the achievement of reaching the Olympics, the emotions of those who win and those who do not, and the coming together of the whole country to support the event. The title was inspired by a child of one of the band members learning to walk during the composition of the song, symbolising the hope and achievement of the moment.
The title sequence used for television coverage of the Games pairs the song with an animation depicting the United Kingdom as one vast stadium.
Although the full version lasts more than six minutes, it was intentionally composed to allow different clips of one or two minutes to be played during montages of winners or losers. 
Availability.
"First Steps" is available only as a digital download from selected retailers, who waived their profits. Elbow also waived any fees from sales. At least 20p from each download will be shared equally between the charities BBC Children in Need and Sport Relief.

Equestrian Scouting and Guiding

Equestrian Scouting and Guiding is a form of Scouting that combines Scouting and equestrianism. It is available as a form of scouting in the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, and the United States.
The Netherlands.
There are three groups in the Netherlands with equestrian scouts, namely "Ruitergidsen Anne de Guigné" in Arnhem, "Scouting Vught" in Vught Noord and "Scouting Manresa" in Venlo. The group in Vught is a has two special equestrian sections, namely "Ruitergidsen" ("Rider Guides") and "Ruitersherpa" ("Rider Senior Guides"); the group in Venlo has one equestrian section, "Ruiterscouts" (7 to 14 years); the group in Arnhem is in its entirety equestrian scouting-dedicated. The equestrian sections unofficially use a black uniform blouse. The equestrian sections are mixed but most of its members are girls.
One of the activities of the HIT, a yearly national event of Scouting Nederland during the Easter weekend, is an equestrian camp.
Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Scout Association was the first organization to introduce, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Equestrian Association (SLEA), Equestrian Scouting to the scouting agenda in the Asia Pacific Region. Even though the equestrian proficiency badge has been included among the five essential badges a scout must obtain to be subjected for the Scouts Awards, the activity has been set aside for the past few decades due to lack of facilities in the country. It was re-initiated in 2010 with the assistance of Premadasa Riding School.
United States of America.
The Boy Scouts of America has a Horsemanship merit badge. The Girl Scouts of the USA have "Horse Fan" and "Horse Rider" badges.

Branch retinal vein occlusion

Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a common retinal vascular disease of the elderly. It is caused by the occlusion of one of the branches of central retinal vein.
Risk factors.
Studies have identified the following abnormalities as risk factors for the development of BRVO:
Diabetes mellitus was not a major independent risk factor.
Manifestations.
Patients with BRVO usually complain of sudden onset of blurred vision or a central visual field defect.
The eye examination findings of acute BRVO include superficial hemorrhages, retinal edema, and often cotton-wool spots in a sector of retina drained by the affected vein.The obstructed vein is dilated and tortuous.
The quadrant most commonly affected is the superotemporal (63%).
Retinal neovascularization occurs in 20% of cases within the first 6–12 months of occlusion and depends on the area of retinal nonperfusion. Neovascularization is more likely to occur if more than five disc diameters of nonperfusion are present and vitreous hemorrhage can ensue.
Diagnosis and testing.
The diagnosis of BRVO is made clinically by finding retinal hemorrhages in the distribution of an obstructed retinal vein.
Treatment.
Several options exist for the treatment of BRVO. These treatments aim for the two of the most significant complications of BRVO, namely macular edema and neovascularization.
Course and outcome.
In general, BRVO has a good prognosis: after 1 year 50–60% of eyes have been reported to have a final VA of 20/40 or better even without any treatment. With time the dramatic picture of an acute BRVO becomes more subtle, hemorrhages fade so that the retina can look almost normal. Collateral vessels develop to help drain the affected area.

Allan Thomson

Allan Kevin Thomson (1943 – 26 September 2006) is a former Australian professional rugby league footballer. He played for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.
He is the uncle of rugby league players Ian Thomson and Gary Thomson.
Career.
Playing.
Thomson, a tough forward from the Lakes United club in the Newcastle Rugby League, represented the district in a 14-7 win over the Parramatta Eels in the 1964 State Cup competition. He went on to play for the NSW Colts against the touring French team later that year. In 1966 he made the first of 8 appearances for New South Wales, and a year later made his test debut for Australia in a 22-13 win over New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He was retained for the second test against New Zealand at Lang Park in Brisbane which saw a 35-22 win for the Australians.
While still playing for Lakes United in Newcastle, Allan Thomson was selected for the 1967-68 Kangaroo Tour at the end of the 1967 season. He played in one test on the tour (his final appearance for Australia), a 16-13 loss to France at the Stade des Minimes in Toulouse, France. He also played in 13 minor games during the tour.
Thomson left Lakes at the end of the 1968 season and linked with NSWRFL club Manly-Warringah in 1969. He was a reserve in the Sea Eagles 23-12 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the 1970 NSWRFL Grand Final, and went on to play in Manly's first ever premiership win in 1972 when the Sea Eagles defeated Eastern Suburbs 19-14 in the Grand Final at the SCG, partnering Terry Randall in the Second-row.
Following the Grand Final win, Thomson returned to Newcastle to once again play for Lakes United.
Coaching.
Allan Thomson returned to Manly as their first grade coach for the 1980 NSWRFL season. The Sea Eagles ended the 22 round season with an 11-9-2 record and a 6th place finish, one spot out of the finals. During his coaching at Manly in 1980, Thomson coached 1972 Grand Final team mates Graham Eadie and Terry Randall. He was replaced in 1981 by former Manly player Ray Ritchie.
Thomson, who had represented Country Firsts six times as a player between 1965 and 1973, was appointed coach of the team in 1983. He coached Country in four of the annual City vs Country games from 1983–86, but lost all four games to NSW City.
Death.
Allan Thomson died on 26 September 2006.

Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee

Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee (1856–1936) was an Indian merchant, politician and philanthropist who went on to play a large role in the development of modern day Kenya during colonial rule.
Early life.
Jevanjee was born in Karachi, then part of the Bombay Presidency in British India to Shia Dawoodi Bohra parents who traced back to the western state of present-day Gujarat. He received minimal education and upon the death of his father embarked on a career as an itinerant peddler, trekking across India and Australia before settling in East Africa.
Business.
In 1895, A.M. Jeevanjee of Karachi — as he was called at the time, was awarded the contract to supply the Imperial British East Africa Company with labour as they built the Kenya-Uganda Railway. He imported his workforce from the Punjab region of British India. The first group to arrive had a total of 350 men and the number grew for the next six years to reach a total of 31,895. Most of the workforce were Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims who worked as skilled labourers, artisans, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, tailors, motor mechanics and electrical fitters.
The construction of the railway proved hugely profitable for Jevanjee and his newly set office in Mombasa ventured into other business interests in the region. His firm undertook contracts to build various government offices, railway stations and post offices all along the Mombasa-Kisumu railway. He further played a large role in the growth of Nairobi, supplying much capital to develop the town's infrastructure.
Politics.
When construction of the Kenya-Uganda Railway reached lake Victoria, Jeevanjee began taking an active role in political life, and launched the African standard which was a weekly newspaper. He had hired an editor-reporter, W.H. Tiller whose work was to oversee the operations of the newspaper. In 1905, he sold the newspaper to two British businessmen who renamed it to East African Standard. Later in 1910 the paper became a daily newspaper and it moved its headquarters to Nairobi which was a fast developing commercial center.
In 1905, he was the first non-white appointed to represent the interests of the Indians in the Legislative Council (Legco) which was established that same year. He also established the East African Indian National Congress.
Jeevanjee gardens.
He started building the Jeevanjee Gardens in 1904 which he later donated to the people of Nairobi in 1906 as a place to relax. These gardens became the subject in the news headlines in 1991 where some leaders in authority were purporting to turn it into a commercial plot. There had been a proposed construction of a Multi-storey car park which was against the wish of Jeevanjee. The youngest remaining daughter of Jeevanjee, the late Shirin Najmudean moved to Nairobi to stop the planned development on the piece of land.

Café gourmand

A café gourmand is a culinary concept aiming at proposing an espresso and a selection of mignardises (also known as petits fours) at the same time, served on the same plate.
Purpose.
The first "café gourmand" is believed to have appeared in restaurants in Paris around 2005. There are similarities between "cafés gourmands" and the English tradition of afternoon tea, although the latter is an altogether different occasion. 
It is a step further in a general trend, in France, to have lunches in restaurants that are quicker than in the past. Back in the 20th century it was common as a minimum to have a starter, then a main course, then a plate of cheese, then a dessert, then a cup of coffee, and then a digestif. Then the starter ceased to be the accepted norm, and the plate of cheese became scarce, and the digestif disappeared. The "café gourmand" represents a further step, as ordering the dessert and the coffee in one go gains time, avoiding the need to have to call the waiter over to order.
Apart from the gain of time, the "café gourmand" has other advantages:
Composition.
While there is no requirement for the composition of a "café gourmand", the desserts most commonly included are chocolate mousse, apple pie, ice cream and crème brûlée.

Isla Tres Perros

Isla Tres Perros is a Panamanian island with an area of located in the middle of the Panama Canal in the southwest region of the Gatun Lake. The Island was created when the waters of the Chagres River were dammed by the Gatun Dam to create the Gatun lake. When the waters rose, they covered a significant part of the existing rainforest, and the hilltops became the islands that are now scattered throughout the lake.
History.
Isla Tres Perros was known locally by other names prior to 1989; since it didn’t officially have a name, residents of other islands all referred to it differently. It wasn’t until 1989 that the island received its current name, which most locals know it by, Isla Tres Perros, Island of the Three Dogs. The island took on this name when three key military officers from the failed 1989 coup took refuge to avoid the military, CPT Jorge Bonilla Arboleda, CPT Juan Jose Arza Aguilera and CPT Jesús Balma. 
The three military officers, all graduates of the Schools of the Americas, supported Major Giraldi’s coup attempt, to over throw Noriega, but when the coup fell apart and conspirators were rounded up and summarily executed, the three young officers went on the run and found themselves held out on Isla Tres Perros, when their boat ran out of gas. Due to the survival skills they had earned through Special Forces and Infantry training, they were able to survive on the small island for three weeks before the Panamanian military finally hunted them down and executed them for treason.
Once the story of the three “fugitive” military officers became public, people began to call it Isla Tres Perros, or Island of the Three Dogs. The story was spurred on by a pro Noriega reporter at La Prensa newspaper.
Notables.
The journalist Escolastico Calvo has been known to live on the island briefly before the invasion of panama to avoid persecution because of his pro Noriega support and printing Noriega propaganda in the Panamanian newspaper "La Hora". When Calvo arrived, there was one family living on the island. He found his way to the island from the fishing town of Arensoa, which is about 500m from the island. From first hand accounts of the family, they stated that he was living on the island for sometime, but the exact length could never be determined as he had bribed them to stay quiet and to prevent his discovery. During his time on the island he had contracted Typhoid and fell ill and became very weak. He was treated by the locals and then finally discovered by the US government Special Forces during the Invasion of Panama.
The movie "The Lost Tribe (2010)" was partially filmed on the Island, as well as the made for television movie Noriega: God's Favorite (2000).

Kishwar Rosha was born on 1 December 1956 in Ambala, Punjab (now Haryana) to Padam and Rajini Rosha. She grew up in Chandigarh, where her father was the head of Punjab Police and graduated from Lady Shri Ram College in 1977, in Economics (Hons).
Career.
She started her career as a print journalist and worked as a political reporter with the Indian Express moving on to television and broadcast media after a while, where she worked for over two decades. She worked as anchor, TV producer and head of a TV channel with some of the major Indian television networks. She was also the Vice President at "Zee Telefilms" ("Zee TV"). She anchored "Doordarshan's" morning show, Good Morning Today after which she took over as the CEO of "Tara Punjabi" TV channel, a part of Broadcast Worldwide, which was established by former "STAR TV" head, Rathikant Basu. Thereafter Kishwar moved to "Zee" and "NDTV", where she worked as a producer.
Kishwar Desai has written four books. She currently writes columns for "The Week" magazine, "The Asian Age" and "The Tribune" newspapers.
Literary career.
Desai’s recently released novel "The Sea of Innocence" is the third in the series, featuring the feisty Indian middle-aged social worker-cum-crime investigator, Simran Singh.
Her award-winning novel "Witness the Night", which was the first in the Simran Singh series, dealt with female foeticide. In a small town in the heart of India, a young girl, barely alive, is found in a sprawling house where thirteen people lie dead. Simran is now her only hope as she is charged with the murder of those dead. The judges of the Costa Award (Anita Rani, Anneka Rice and Mark Thornton) said “Kishwar Desai pulls off a remarkable trick, transplanting a country-house murder to modern-day India in a book that's not afraid to tackle serious themes.” Witness the Night was also shortlisted for the Author’s Club First Novel Award and longlisted for the 2009 Man Asian Literary Prize.
In "Origins of Love", Desai took a close look at surrogacy and adoption. Simran Singh is asked to examine the case of an abandoned baby at an IVF clinic and what follows is a maze of new age fertility rites, and surrogacy. It received critical acclaim in UK, Australia and India.
And in her latest, "The Sea of Innocence", Simran Singh is trying to find a British girl Liza Kay who has gone missing from the beaches of Goa. It has recently been published in India and has been receiving rave reviews. "The Sea of Innocence" is influenced by the Delhi gangrape case last December.
Prior to writing fiction, Desai wrote a probing yet affectionate biography of two extraordinary people, Nargis and Sunil Dutt, two iconic Indian film stars in "Darlingji: The True Love Story of Nargis and Sunil Dutt." The book based on interviews with the Dutt family and friends, explored their lives in detail and tells the larger story of the evolution of Hindi cinema, and of a society and a nation in the throes of change. Desai has also written a play, "Manto"!, based on the life of the famous Urdu writer, Saadat Hasan Manto, which won the TAG Omega Award for Best Play in 1999.
Desai is now working on the next book in Simran Singh series.
Personal life.
After her first marriage, she changed her name to Kishwar Ahluwalia and has a son, Gaurav and a daughter, Malika from the marriage. On 20 July 2004, after a divorce, she married economist Meghnad Desai, a member of the British House of Lords. She lives between London, Delhi and Goa.

Mixed brigade

A mixed brigade () was a tactical military formation of the Spanish Republican Army following the coup of July 1936 and the onset of the Spanish Civil War.
It was the basic military unit of the Republican People's Army after its war-dictated 1936 reorganization.
The initial structure of this kind of brigade, approved in October 1936, was composed of four infantry battalions of five companies each, a mixed sapper battalion and a Service Corps company that included a medical corps group. Certain brigades had also a cavalry section. A division was composed of two or three mixed brigades.
The mixed brigade was based on a model that would replace the columns ("columnas") and militias of the pre-coup Spanish Republican Army. The first six Mixed Brigades were created on 18 October 1936. The first was led by Communist colonel Enrique Líster, the second by Jesús Martínez de Aragón, the third by José María Galán, the fourth by Eutiquiano Arellano, the fifth by Fernando Sabio and the sixth by Miguel Gallo Martínez. By December 1936 there were fifteen brigades in full service (1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th International Brigades, 35th, 37th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 43rd, 44th, 50th and one unnumbered). By the spring of 1937 there were 40 active brigades, and another 15 there were training. This brigades were swiftly placed in divisions.
Mixed brigades were typically Army units, however, the 151 Brigada Mixta, was a mixed brigade composed of Spanish Republican Navy Marines "(Infantería de Marina)" led by Commander Pedro Muñoz Caro. Photographer Robert Capa took pictures of the 151 Brigada Mixta in the Battle of the Segre.

Paolo Gislimberti

Paolo Giancarlo Faletti Gislimberti (19 May 1967 – 10 September 2000) was an Italian volunteer firefighter and youth coach. He was killed by a loose wheel from Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Jordan Formula One car in the 2000 Italian Grand Prix.
Biography.
Gislimberti was born in Trento, Italy and often spent his spare time working as Deputy Commander of the volunteer firefighter brigade in Lavis where he lived. In 1990, he was a member of the CEA Squadra Corse, a well known firefighter company that fielded more than 200 men. Gislimberti also worked as a youth coach for the Trentino Volley team.
Death.
In the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, Gislimberti was working for CEA Squadra Corse at Monza. Before the start of the race, he moved further up from his post taking his fire extinguisher with him. During the first lap of the race, Gislimberti had stopped for a brief moment after running back to check on his fire-fighting equipment as a multiple-car accident at the Variante della Roggia corner sent a wheel from Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Jordan flying, striking Gislimberti with full force leading to massive head and chest injuries. His red helmet came loose and rolled near towards the side of the track. Another firefighter standing next to Gislimberti attempted to save his life before medical help from Sid Watkins and Gary Hartstein arrived on the scene. He was taken to the First Aid Room at Monza Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Gislimberti's death was the first Formula One related fatality since the death of Ayrton Senna in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and the first for a bystander since Team Osella mechanic Giovanni Amadeo was killed in the pitlane at Zolder in May 1981. An autopsy reported that Gislimberti also suffered from cardiac arrest when he was struck by the wheel of Frentzen's car. He was survived by his pregnant wife of two years Elena who had a daughter named Lisa born in December 2000 and has received financial help from the Formula One community via a fund. His parents, two brothers and sister also outlived him. Bernie Ecclestone donated $40,000 and the teams donated $10,000 with the drivers holding an auction to sell their overalls used in the 2000 United States Grand Prix.
Funeral.
Gislimberti's funeral was held in Lavis at the San Ulderico church on 14 September. His coffin was wrapped with the flag of Ferrari as Gislimberti had a passion for the team, which was represented by Luca Badoer, Claudio Berro and Stefano Domenicali. His widow Elena and other friends and relatives were present along with Formula 1 driver Gastón Mazzacane. A cushion of pink flowers and Gislimberti's helmet was accompanied by fellow firefighters. 110 red roses were sent by Rubens Barrichello and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, while the top teams and the FIA sent wreaths for the occasion.

Reception.
Critical response.
"The Mistress" received widely positive reviews. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 81% rating and an average rating score of 4 out of 5.
Philbert Ortiz Dy gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. He stated that "The Mistress" doesn’t do a very good job of exploring what it is to be a mistress. It only depicts a few stolen moments from the adulterous relationship, focusing instead on the budding romance between the two younger characters.[...]The movie isn't as complex as the premise makes it sound. Though it tackles mature subject matter and plays with Oedipal themes, the film is really much more about the love story than it is about the adultery. He also stated that "The Mistress" can still be quite affecting. Taken away from the larger narrative, the movie is able to build a compelling fantasy that’s far more romantic than one would expect and It still makes a compelling case for itself every now and then.
Phillip Cu-Unjieng of The Philippine Star magazine gave also a positive feedbacks to "The Mistress". He states that Star Cinema's "The Mistress" is a "superb acting vehicle for both Bea Alonzo and John Lloyd Cruz, proving that even when tackling more mature roles, their chemistry, after a full decade, remains intact. And "The Mistress" has it’s texture of the screenplay and the sympathetic depth of the characters that make it such an absorbing film.
In a positive response by Maridol Rañoa-Bismark of Yahoo Philippines, "The Mistress" may be a serious film, but it can make moviegoers break into smiles with snippets of humor and “It’s a suspension of disbelief that will amaze even the most rabid mistress hater.”
Mark Angelo Ching and Jocelyn Dimaculangan of PEP also gave a positive response to the film, they stated that, "This movie casts a sympathetic look at someone who agrees to be a kept woman in exchange for a huge debt. But far from glorifying the mistress, the film delves into the heartwrenching pain brought about by being caught in this four-sided love affair."
Box office.
According to Star Cinema's Advertising and Promotions Manager Mico del Rosario, "The Mistress" raked a whopping PHP 25 Million on its first day, beating the box-office record set by the other Star Cinema produced movie last year and currently the 3rd highest grossing film of all time - "The Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin" starring Vice Ganda which only grossed PHP 23.9 Million on its opening day.

Andrew Jeptha

Andrew Daries Jeptha (born 30 December 1879) was the first black boxer to win a British Boxing title, winning the Welterweight title in London on 25 March 1907. However, Jeptha is not often recognised as the first black British boxing champion.
Early life.
Andrew Jeptha was born on 30 December 1879 in Capetown, South Africa. He was the son of a Cape Town carpenter and was educated at the Marist Brothers School in Hope Street, Capetown.
Andrew Jeptha came to England in 1902 after winning a boxing competition in South Africa organised by visiting world champion Kid McCoy. He married Abby Mitchell (born 2 December 1881 in Adlington, Lancashire) in 1904 in the District of St Marylebone, London. They had four children. Abby Mitchell was the daughter of Charles Mitchell and Mary Ellen Hope. Her parents ran the Cardwell Arms pub in Chorley Road, Adlington.
Career.
Andrew Jeptha became a professional boxer in South Africa before the age of 18 years, fighting as a professional in the Vaudeville Theatre and also in Fillis' Circus. He started his boxing career in England as a booth fighter and was reportedly a big attraction for Peddlar McMahon who operated a booth-fighting business.
Jeptha had 62 fights during his career, winning 29 (KO 21), losing 23 (KO 8) and drawing 5. He was a popular and well known boxer. Stories about him often appeared in newspapers and he was known as "le Negre" in France and as "the Boer" in Ireland. His first recorded fight in England, which he lost, was against Jim Green in Liverpool in September 1902.
Andrew Jeptha won his British Boxing title in a fight hall called Wonderland at 100 Whitechapel Road, Mile End, London on 25 March 1907, when he knocked out Curly Watson in the fourth round. The fight was arranged for a purse of five hundred and fifty pounds. At the time, Watson (who was also known as Robert Watson, Curley Watson and Seaman Watson) was the boxing champion of the Royal Navy. Sadly, Curly Watson later died of injuries sustained in a fight with Frank Inglis in London on 5 March 1910. 
Jeptha had been having problems with damage to his eyesight since before the March 1907 title fight and had received treatment at the Moorfields Eye Hospital, but now only had hazy vision.
Jeptha did not hold onto the title for long as he was defeated by Joe White (boxer) in the British welterweight title at Cardiff in August 1907. He was at the peak of his career at this point, but knew that he needed to retire because of the problems with his eyesight. However, he kept on fighting and was able to make a living outside of boxing for a while when he appeared in a play called "Black against White". An actress called Mabel Goldswain appeared with him in this vaudeville play, along with British lightweight champion Jack Goldswain. Jeptha played the role of a villain and it is said that his eyes suffered further damage from heavy blows to the head from Goldswain in every performance.
Later life.
Jeptha fought Jim Doran in October 1909 and the sight in his right eye was permanently damaged during this contest. However, he continued to box until he was injured in a fight with Joe White in July 1910. Apparently, the famous referee John Douglas and his son Johnny Douglas, together with other prominent sportsman, tried to help him earn a living. Andrew Jeptha was in hospital in Liverpool for a while, but unfortunately nothing could be done to save his sight. HIs supporters bought him a tobacconist and confectionery shop in Walthamstow, but he was unable to make a go of it because of his lack of sight.
Andrew Jeptha returned to South Africa without his wife and children. It is recorded that he could be seen sitting on the sidewalk between the flower sellers in Adderley Street, Cape Town, selling a booklet at the price of one shilling. The title of this booklet was "A South African Boxer in Britain – Experiences of Andrew Jephta". There is a copy of this book in the South African Museum in Capetown, South Africa. 05
Andrew Jeptha died in South Africa in 1920.

Maratelli

Maratelli is a "Semifino" rice, native to the Asigliano Vercellese province of Vercelli northern Italy. It is a stable rice genotype that maintains its features. In 1970 it covered 8% of Italian rice-cultivated fields. Maratelli rice keeps its shape better than other forms of rice during the slow cooking required for making risotto due to higher quantities of amylose. "Maratelli" is an historical variety of "Italian rice production", developed in 1919 through the selection of Chinese Originario by Mr. Mario Maratelli from Asigliano Vercellese. Maratelli is a semi-early variety (15 days earlier than Chinese originario) which shows a medium-height, “semifino”, awnless pearl grain. Maratelli shows a high seedling vegetative vigor, quite a good tiller index (7 fertile stems/plant), good cold tolerance at germination stage, medium cold tolerance at flowering stage.
The life of Maratelli Rice.
Maratelli rice was “born” at Asigliano (Vercelli) in the autumn of 1914 when the rice farmer Mario Maratelli sees a rice plant in the field which is different from all the other plants of the Chinese Originario he is growing in that field. The plant has longer panicles, is droopier and has a larger number of grains. The panicles are yellow which is typical of full ripening and therefore near to harvesting. These panicles are different from the other panicles in the fields in that they have matured early whereas the others are hardly yellow and not mature.
The rice farmer Maratelli picks these already mature panicles, he isolates them, he packs them to preserve them with the intention of sowing these “different” kernels the following year.The next year he sows the few kernels on an isolated plot of land and closely follows all the biological phases of the plants which germinate from them.He takes note of the tiller index of the mother plants and also, above all, the early ripening in comparison to the other cultivars grown. He receives confirmation of the differences he had observed the previous year and all the panicles present underlined these differences when they matured. Maratelli notes the vegetative development of the plants and compares these characteristics with those of plants from other varieties underlining certain positive aspects, these are: early maturing, better yield, better use of the land. The grains of white rice are tried in the kitchen to prepare classic dishes (risotto, panissa, rice in broth…) and once again the new rice finds wide approval in as much as it doesn’t overcook, it combines well with other ingredients and satisfies the housewives. The new variety spreads rapidly in the Vercellese lowland and in a few short years takes over from the other established varieties and imposes and maintains the record for a long time.Recently an important step has been taken to recoup and enhance the rice “invented” by Mario Maratelli in 1914. From the end of April, 2013, the original Maratelli has been inserted in the National Register of Historic Varieties.

Adnan Kapau Gani

Adnan Kapau Gani (16 September 1905 – 23 December 1968), often abbreviated as A. K. Gani, was an Indonesian politician. Born in West Sumatra, he spent much of his youth in Java, where he studied medicine and became involved with the nascent nationalist movement before going to South Sumatra to work as a doctor. During the Indonesian National Revolution he served three terms as Minister of Welfare; two of these were concurrent with terms as a deputy prime minister. Afterwards Gani went to Palembang, South Sumatra, where he remained active in politics until his death. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia.
Early life.
Gani was born in Palembajan, West Sumatra, west of Bukittinggi, on 16 September 1905. The son of a teacher, he finished his early studies in Bukittinggi in 1923 before going to Batavia (modern day Jakarta), first for his secondary studies and then to study medicine. He graduated from STOVIA (Dutch: School tot Opleiding van Indische Artsen), a school for prospective doctors, in 1926.
From his teens Gani was active in politics and social organisations. He was a member of several groups for native youth, including Jong Java and Jong Sumatera. By the late 1920s he had several enterprises running, including a boarding house and book reseller. This revenue enabled him to donate funds to the Youth Congress of 1928, where the Youth Pledge was first read and "Indonesia Raya" (the national anthem of Indonesia) was first played; Gani also attended this conference. In 1931 he joined Partindo, which had split off from the Indonesian National Party (, or PNI) shortly after Sukarno's arrest by the colonial government. Gani became acquainted with Sukarno after the latter's release from prison the following year and joined the Indonesian Political Federation with him.
Long interested in theatre, in 1941 Gani starred in Union Film's "Asmara Moerni" after being invited by the film's director, Rd. Ariffien. At the time the country's film industry was beginning to cater to well-educated audiences. Although some of the audience considered Gani's involvement in "Asmara Moerni" as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary to improve how the people viewed local productions. The film, the only one Gani ever made, was a commercial success. That year Gani received his medical degree.
After the Japanese occupied the Indies in 1942, Gani refused to collaborate. As such, he was arrested in September 1943 and held until October of the following year. He spent the rest of the occupation as a private practitioner.
National revolution.
After the country's independence and during the ensuing revolution, Gani gained greater political power while also serving with the military. From 1945 to 1947 he was the commissioner for the PNI in South Sumatra, also serving on that party's board. He also coordinated military efforts in the province. He considered Palembang a viable economic powerhouse for the newly independent nation, arguing that with oil they could gather international support. He negotiated sales with international interests, including the Dutch-owned Shell while smuggling weapons and military supplies past the Dutch blockade. He had numerous connections in the Chinese community in Singapore, which assisted him in these tasks.
From 2 October 1946 until 27 June 1947 Gani served as Minister of Welfare under Sutan Sjahrir in the prime minister's third cabinet; Sjahrir later remarked that he felt as if Gani had been imposed upon him by Sukarno, who was by then president. While serving as minister of welfare Gani, with Sjahrir and Mohammad Roem, served as the Indonesian delegation to the third plenary session for the Linggadjati Agreement, becoming a signatory on 25 March 1947; the Dutch considered him undiplomatic and prone to showing his emotions. He also worked to establish a national banking network, the BTC, as well as several trade organisations.
With Amir Sjarifuddin and Setijadji, Gani was a formateur for the new cabinet, which received its mandate on 3 July. He stayed on as Minister of Welfare while also serving as a deputy prime minister under Sjarifuddin. Gani was the first cabinet member arrested during Operation Product, a Dutch assault on Indonesian-held territory in mid-July, but was later released. He also attended a trade conference in Havana, Cuba. In Sjarifuddin's second cabinet, Gani continued to serve as a deputy prime minister and minister of welfare until the cabinet collapsed on 29 January 1948 owing to dissatisfaction with the Renville Agreement.
Post revolution.
After the revolution ended in 1949, Gani became the Military Governor of South Sumatra. In 1954, while still involved in politics as minister of transportation in the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, he became the rector of Sriwijaya University in Palembang; he remained active in the province until his death on 23 December 1968. He was buried in Siguntang Heroes' Cemetery in Palembang. Gani was survived by his wife, Masturah; the couple had no children.
Legacy.
On 9 November 2007, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono gave Gani the title National Hero of Indonesia; Gani received the title along with Slamet Rijadi, Ida Anak Agung Gde Agung, and Moestopo based on Presidential Decree Number 66 / TK of 2007.

They asked for ransoms of several hundred thousand euros in each case, and in the event of delay or insufficient payment, cut fingers off their victims. In a December 2009 police action, more than 25 people were arrested in several Bulgarian cities.
Naglite kept their victims blindfolded and none managed to see any of the kidnappers' faces. Nine people were brought to trial in 2010, four of whom were found guilty in April 2012. The Prosecutor's office plans to appeal for the others to also be convicted.

Olympic route network

The Olympic route network (ORN) and the Paralympic route network (PRN) is a network of dedicated roads linking venues and other key sites in the host city during Olympic and Paralympic games to ensure that athletes and officials get to events on time. Roads that are part of the network have 'games lanes' which are reserved for accredited games vehicles and on-call emergency vehicles.
For the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the route network came into effect under the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 which gave the Olympic Delivery Authority temporary powers to take over traffic management measures during London 2012.
The ORN and PRN were first introduced for the 2000 Sydney Olympics as a result of problems at the Atlanta Olympics four years earlier when athletes had difficulty getting to their events on time. In July 2012, just before the start of the 2012 Olympics, London taxi drivers blocked some games lanes to protest against the ORN. The games lanes for London 2012 has been pejoratively referred to as ZiL lanes, in reference to dedicated lanes for VIPs in Moscow.

Radha Kumar

Radha Kumar is an Indian feminist, left-wing academic and author. Her work focuses on ethnic conflicts and peace processes from a strongly feminist and left-wing perspective.
Career.
Kumar has a Phd from Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, an institution well known for its strong communist orientation. She has been a director at the Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution at Jamia Milia Islamia, an Islamic left-wing institution located in Delhi. She is currently Director-General of the "Delhi Policy Group", a think-tank of which she is also a co-founder
Kashmir interlocutor panel.
In October 2010, Kumar was appointed as one of the three interlocutors for Jammu and Kashmir appointed by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) of the Central Government of India. The panel was headed by Dilip Padgaonkar, former editor of the Times of India. and the other member was M.M. Ansari, a former Election Commissioner of India. Kumar's qualification and prior experience for the job lay in her ideology and in her closeness to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, both of whom are committed and energetic supporters of feminist and communist activism.
Within a few weeks of the panel's constitution, and after private hints had failed, a public reprimand was issued to the panel by P. Chidambaram, home minister of India, for speaking too freely and too frequently to the press; and also for pushing various schemes and solutions, when the assigned job of the panel was to gauge and summarize the views and ideas of Kashmiri society. All of these criticisms pertained to actions taken by Kumar. Her reaction to the reprimand was to tell the press that the home minister (who had appointed the panel) had no business to tell the interlocutors what they should do. Next, Kumar had issues with her co-panelists over her having attended a conference regarding Kashmir organized in Brussels by the Tramboo Center, founded by Abdul Majeed Tramboo and closely associated with Pakistans spy agency, the ISI. The internal rift reached a level where Kumar reportedly sent in her resignation to the home minister. She was persuaded to stay, since the panel was dealing with a matter as sensitive as Kashmir. The aggravation arising from this issue spilled over into disputes over petty matters and the panel was rift-ridden to the end of its term. The report it finally submitted was placed on the website of the home ministry for less than 24 hours before being taken down. It has never been heard of since then.

J. F. Schwarzlose Söhne

J.F. Schwarzlose Söhne was a German perfume-manufacturer that operated from 1856 to 1976, with its heyday between about 1870 and WWII. They specialized in perfume but also sold powders, soaps and other toiletries. A new company was founded in 2012, as J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin, selling fragrances under some of the same historical brand names.
History.
In 1856, Joachim Friedrich Schwarzlose, a piano-maker, founded the company J.F. Schwarzlose Söhne for his children Franz, Kurt, Max and Hedwig. The company was initially a pharmacy but two brothers Kurt and Max left the main business and came to specialize in the production of perfumes. The store was located at Markgrafenstraße 29 in Berlin. In 1895, J.F. Schwarzlose Söhne took over the distinguished fragrance manufacturer Treu & Nuglisch, which was founded in the 1820s and had been a purveyor to the Court, thus giving the company a good reputation among imperial and royal personages. From then on, business was done under the name of J.F. Schwarzlose Söhne – Treu & Nuglisch.
In 1902, Ernst Köthner, grandson of Joachim Friedrich Schwarzlose, became the owner and with him the company began to expand, from Europe to Asia and Australia. In 1922, Ernst Köthner and his wife, Hedwig Köthner, renamed the company J.F. Schwarzlose Söhne GmbH. The factory was located on Dreysestraße 5 in Moabit. In September 1930, they moved to a modernized store located on Leipziger Straße 113. Two months later, in November 1930, Ernst Köthner died and son Werner took over the company and became head of the company with his mother Hedwig Köthner.
After the factory and shops were destroyed in 1944, Anni Köthner restarted the business in 1947, first in Hamburg, then again in Berlin. Difficulties came with the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because offices in the districts of Prenzlauer Berg and Moabit and the shop in Leipziger Straße were separated by it. In 1965, Anni Müller-Godet – born Köthner – becomes the new head of the company. In 1976, J. F. Schwarzlose Söhne was liquidated.
Products.
The fragrances that were popular included the floral "Rosa Centifolia" and "Hymen", a German bouquet-fantasy "Royalin", or masculine cologne "Finale". Between the First and Second World Wars leather fragrances "Juchten" and "IA-33" (for women) were popular throughout Germany and Europe. The latter's unusual name derived from the license plate for Berlin at this time. The flacon was designed in the Artdéco-style and resembled a car radiator grill – a sign of the modern way of life in the intellectual and progressive capital. Other important products were "Treffpunkt 8 Uhr", "Hohenzollern Veilchen", and "Lilaflor".
J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin.
A new company was founded in 2012, under the name of J.F. Schwarzlose Berlin. Perfumer Véronique Nyberg (of International Flavors & Fragrances) and designer Lutz Herrmann created four fragrances: floral linden fragrance "1A-33", spicy woody fragrance "Treffpunkt 8 Uhr", "Trance" and "Rausch". The first three use the names from the old company, and the fourth was new.

Located between Maisaka-juku and Arai-juku, in what is now the city of Kosai, Shizuoka Prefecture, the checkpoint was strategically positioned on the narrow strip of land between Lake Hamana and the Pacific Ocean, and was the only checkpoint on the Tōkaidō intended for travelers both by land and by water. All travelers were required to submit to an examination of their travel permits, and taxes were levied on commercial travelers with merchandise. 
The initial checkpoint, built around 1600, was destroyed by a tsunami during the Genroku period (1688-1703) and rebuilt only to be destroyed again during the 1707 Hōei earthquake. It was then moved to its current location on the western shore of Lake Hamana. The structures were rebuilt again after the 1854 Ansei-Tōkai earthquake.
The main building is a single-story structure facing south, with Irimoya gambrel sides and a tiled roof. It is long from east to west, and is divided into several rooms within.
Following the Meiji Restoration, the barrier was abolished in 1869, and its buildings were converted for use as an elementary school, followed by government offices until 1951. 
In 1921, the site was recognized as a National Historic Site, and in recognition that it had only surviving Edo-period checkpoint structure remaining in the country, its status was upgraded to that of a Special National Historic Site in 1955. The main building was restored in 1971, and additional buildings, such as gates and a pier, were re-created in 1998 on their original foundations as part of a museum.

Ernest Toovey

Ernest Albert Toovey MBE, OAM (16 May 1922 – 18 July 2012) was an Australian cricketer and baseball player. In cricket, Toovey was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Warwick, Queensland.
Toovey served in the Royal Australian Navy during World War II, enlisting for service when he was seventeen. He served during the war aboard HMAS Perth, where he was present during the Battle of the Java Sea and was also aboard the ship during its sinking at the Battle of Sunda Strait in February 1942. Half of the ships crew were lost, while the remainder who survived, including Ordinary seaman Toovey, were captured by the Japanese and spent the remainder of the war in Prisoner of War camps. While imprisoned, he reportedly resisted recommendations to have his leg amputated because of an ulcer, telling his captors "You can't take my leg off because I've got to play cricket for Queensland." His time as a prisoner saw Toovey put to work as part of the forced labour constructing the Thai-Burma Railway.
Following the end of the war and his release from Japanese captivity, Toovey stuck by his wartime aim of playing cricket for Queensland by making his first-class debut for the state against South Australia in the 1949–50 Sheffield Shield. He made 36 further first-class appearances for Queensland, the last of which came against New South Wales in the 1955–56 Sheffield Shield. In his 37 first-class appearances for Queensland, he scored 1,346 runs at an average of 24.03, with a high score of 87. One of nine half centuries he made, this score came against Victoria in the 1950–51 Sheffield Shield. Following his playing career for Queensland, he served as a selector for the Queensland side, as well as serving on the Queensland panel as chairman for nearly 25 years, before retiring in 1989. He was also the President of Northern Suburbs District Cricket Club.
Outside of cricket, he played baseball for Queensland and Australia, having first played Baseball as a Prisoner of War in a match between Australia POWs and American POWs, which was organised by the Japanese Commandant. He was also prominent in ex-services organisations, holding executive positions in Returned and Services League of Australia and Australian Prisoners of War Association, for which he received the MBE and OAM. He died at Mitchelton, Queensland, on 18 July 2012. His funeral was held at St Brigids Catholic Church, Red Hill, Queensland, on 24 July.

Free Arabian Legion

Free Arabian Legion (جيش بلاد العرب الحرة) was a Nazi German military unit formed from Arab volunteers from the Middle East and North Africa during World War II.
It was created by Amin al-Husseini and Rashid Ali when they suggested the formation of an army of Arab volunteers, which was adopted by Adolf Hitler in 1941. The unit was based on a smaller force, commanded by Hellmuth Felmy, mainly to assist the Pro-Nazi revolt in Iraq which was suppressed by the British. The unit was first settled in Syria and included several Iraqi expatriates, and Syrian Arabs. After the conquest of Syria by the British and Free-French forces, the unit was moved to Sounion in Greece. There it received more Arab and Muslim troops who were on the soil of Europe at the time, as prisoners of war, or as volunteers.
The Nazis planned to use the legion in conquering the Caucasus, rising an Iraqi exiled-government there, and use as a force station, as a way of conquering Iraq (an end that was never taken).
In Operation Torch the Allies took Tunisia, which had been governed by Vichy France. During the fighting the German command called on Tunisian Arabs to join the Legion.
The legion mainly assisted the assigned forces. Their morale was low and it seems that the Nazis were not satisfied with the Legion's service. After the death of its commander, the Legion was taken out from the Front, and in the war's latter years, fought in Greece.

Jonas moved after her marriage with the miller Peter Meurer to Neuss. There she began suffering from severe epileptic-shocks. She worked as a midwife but was also a so-called cunning woman, as she was familiar with herbalism, particularly mandrakes.
In November 1635 (at the age of approximately 64 years) she was arrested, examined and tortured because of witchcraft. The court of the Mayor of Neuss accused her among others of having made a deal with the devil. From already a few years back she had the reputation of being a witch. In the wake of growing public rumors the authorities were forced to do something. At the first two hearings on the 15th and 22 November Jonas denied the charges made. On December 19 and 20 she was made to sit on a chair spiked with sharp nails for almost three hours.
After being tortured she gave a false confession. Jonas also agreed to committing fornication with a black man named "Hans Beelzebub" and to damaging humans and animals by using black magic. On the same night she escaped from her captivity, but was seized again after a short time. Jonas repudiated her confession, but her resistance was broken after a violent whipping the next day. So she confessed to all charges and the court sentenced her to death by beheading. 
On December 24 she was beheaded by an executioner. Subsequently her body was burnt and the ashes were blown away in all cardinal points.
The entire transcripts are still available in the city archive of Neuss.

Berta Soler

Berta de los Angeles Soler Fernandez (born July 31st, 1963, in Matanzas, Cuba) is a Cuban dissident. She is the current leader of Ladies in White, a group originally composed of wives and female relatives of political prisoners who protested on their behalf which has since 2011 transformed into a more general human rights group open to Cuban women. She assumed leadership following the death of group founder Laura Pollan. In 2012, the Associated Press described her as "one of Cuba's leading dissidents".
Background.
Soler is a former microbiology technician at a Havana hospital. She is married to Angel Moya Acosta, a construction worker and dissident, with whom she has two sons, Luis Angel and Lienys.
Activism.
In March 2003, Soler's husband Moya, the founder of the Alternative Option Movement, was arrested during Cuba's "Black Spring" crackdown on political dissidents. He was later sentenced to twenty years in prison. 
Soler then became a founding member of the Ladies in White, a group composed of wives and female relatives of political prisoners. Each Sunday, members would dress in white and march down Havana's Fifth Avenue in protest of their husbands' continued detention.
When Moya suffered a herniated disc in October 2004, Soler began a campaign to urge the government to give him an operation, submitting a letter to President Fidel Castro on his behalf and staging a rare protest in Havana's Plaza de la Revolución with the Ladies in White. She described the protest as "my right and duty as a wife". After two days of protest, Moya was given surgery.
Soler was one of five members of the Ladies to be selected to receive the 2005 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought of the European Parliament. The Cuban government barred the group's leaders from attending the Sakharov Prize award ceremony in Strasbourg, France, drawing an appeal on the group's behalf from the European Parliament.
After Moya's release from prison, he and Soler chose to remain in Cuba and continue their calls for the release of political prisoners, despite being offered emigration to Spain. 
In March 2012, Soler and Moya were detained along with three dozen other demonstrators when they staged their weekly protest ahead of a visit of Pope Benedict XVI. Soler told reporters that authorities had warned the Ladies to avoid Benedict's public appearances, including masses. She responded, "They are mistaken because who is going to prohibit us from being close to Christ, being close to God, to the pope who is represents Christ on earth?"

Hohburg Hills

The Hohburg Hills (), also called Hohburg Switzerland ("Hohburger Schweiz"), are located in the district of Nordsachsen near the eponymous village of Hohburg in the municipality of Lossatal in the German state of Saxony. 
Geography.
These quartz-porphyry hills rise prominently up to 120 metres out of the surround plain of the Leipzig Bay, east of the River Mulde. Their highest point is the Löbenberg at (). Other high points are the Gaudlitzberg (), the Burzelberg () and the Galgenberg ("Gallows Hill", ). South of Hohburg is the Kleine Berg ("Little Hill" with a height of .
In the valley lying amongst the Hohburg Hills, the stream of the Lossabach flows through Müglenz, Hohburg, Klein- and Großzschepa to empty into the Mulde near Thallwitz.
History.
The Hohburg Hills were shaped by decades of intensive stone quarrying. This produced steep rock faces and several lakes in the hollows that were left behind. The rock faces, up to forty meters high, have been used for climbing since 1925. Climbers from the area, such as Felix Simon, made use of the terrain as a training ground for the Alps. Many of the climbs used in those days fell victim to ongoing quarry operations. From 1965, the "Schwarze Wand" ("Black Wall") has been used for Alpine training (aid climbing). Since the mid-1990s, many, new, very difficult routes have emerged as part of a further wave of development. Currently there are over 200 climbing routes in various quarries.

Cardiff Cricket Club

Cardiff Cricket Club is a cricket club based in Whitchurch, Cardiff, Wales. It was established in 1819 and forms the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club with its headquarters at Cardiff Arms Park. The first team plays in the South Wales Premier Cricket League. It is one of the oldest sporting organisations in the whole of Wales.
History.
Cardiff Cricket Club was established in 1819. The club initially played on various cricket grounds, mostly in eastern Cardiff, due to better drainage. The club then moved to Cardiff Arms Park, but it was more of a gentlemen's club, rathar that a sports club. By 1867 the Bute Estate agreed that the cricket club could rent the eastern part of the Arms Park at only one shilling per annum. By April 1875 the Bute Estate decided to restrict access to the Arms Park to Cardiff Cricket Club and other recognised clubs.
In 1922 Cardiff Football Club, later renamed Cardiff Rugby Football Club and Cardiff Cricket Club amalgamated to form the Cardiff Athletic Club. There had been previous attempts to merge the clubs, in November 1892 and between 1902 and 1904, when the two clubs worked closely to fund a new pavilion to serve the needs of both clubs, but it was not until 1922 that the merger finally took place. Later the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited was formed by Cardiff Athletic Club, Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) acquired the land from the Bute Estate for £30,000 (GBP), but on the understanding that the Arms Park was only used for recreational purposes and was not sold for building. The cricket section of the Athletic Club acquired a 99 lease from the company at a rental of £200 per annum, with Glamorgan County Cricket Club paying rent for the use of the park for county cricket.
The existing wooden cricket and rugby pavilion had been demolished and new changing rooms included in the new North Stand. In 1937 a new cricket pavilion was built for the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club. By the mid 1950s improvements meant that the capacity of the cricket ground had increased to around 15,000, although the ground was still very small and often visiting teams agreed to the boundaries being shortened so that people could sit on the grass. Cardiff Athletic Club however wanted to develop new facilities for both the bowls and tennis sections, and did not allow new seating to be erected just for county games. A new scheme was developed to change the existing rugby ground into the National Stadium, and creating a smaller ground for Cardiff R.F.C. on the existing cricket ground, with the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club moving to Sophia Gardens. Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at Cardiff Arms Park against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966.
In 1998, Cardiff Athletic Club sold the Sophia Gardens ground to Glamorgan County Cricket Club and the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club (Cardiff Cricket Club) for many years had no fixed cricket ground, while they were looking for a suitable cricket ground. In 1997 the club moved to their permanent home of the Diamond cricket ground at Forest Farm, Whitchurch, Cardiff and by July 2007 a new pavilion had been built on the ground.
Cardiff Cricket Club have won the South Wales Premier Cricket League in both 2009 and 2011.

Black Native Party

The Black Native Party (, abbreviated PAN) was a political party in Uruguay seeking to defend the rights of the Afro-Uruguayan community. The founders of the party were Afro-Uruguayan intellectuals whom sought to develop the party as a platform to elect Afro-Uruguayans to Congress. The party was founded in 1936 and was close to the "Nuestra Raza" group. The foundation of PAN followed the establishment of two other Black political parties in Latin America, in Cuba (1908) and Brazil (1931).
Founding.
A first reference of the project to launch a Black political party can be found in the October 24, 1935 issue of "Nuestra Raza". The following issues of the journal carried more editorials and articles arguing for the foundation of the party. On May 9, 1936 a preliminary assembly of the party was held. Some thirty people participated in the event. Two preparatory bodies were named, a Reporting Committee and a Provisional Board. On May 23, 1936 the manifesto of the party (drafted by the Reporting Committee) was adopted at a party meeting. The manifesto of the party was formulated along Popular Front lines, calling for struggle against fascism and imperialism.
Salvador Betervide was the founding chairman of the party. Other founders included Ventura Barrios and Elemo Cabral. After Betervide's death from tuberculosis in 1936 the chairmanship of the party was taken over by Mario Méndez. On January 5, 1937 the party was recognized by the Electoral Court. In March 1937 a new manifesto was issued, following similar lines as the original party manifesto.
Local committees.
On July 5, 1937 a local committee of the party was established in Rivera. On December 4, 1937 a General Assembly of the party was organized. On December 18, 1937 a local committee was set up in the town of Melo.
"Pan".
The party published the journal "Pan" ('Bread') as its organ. The first issue was published on April 15, 1937. Nine issues were published until December 1937. Sandalio del Puerto was the editor of "Pan", until being replaced by Carmelo Gentile in October 1937.
Electoral debacle.
On March 5, 1938 the party convention was opened. The convention was a public event. The majority of the 22 participants came from Montevideo. The convention was chaired by Victoriano Rivero, Isabelino José Gares and Félix Tejera. At the meeting a draft candidate list for the upcoming elections was presented. On the second day of the convention (March 7), 16 people participated. The candidate list was approved with Mario Méndez as the top candidate. Other candidates were Carmelo Gentile, Pilar Barrios, Rufino Silva Gonzalez, Juan Carlos Martinez, Rolando R. Olivera, Victoriano Rivero, Cándido Guimaraes, Sandalio del Puerto and Roberto Sosa.
The party failed to win major support as the majority of Afro-Uruguayans preferred to vote for either of the two main parties. The party launched a list of ten candidates ahead of the 1938 general election. The election campaign, carried out in Montevideo, centered around racial discrimination in employment in the state administration. The campaign had meager results, though, receiving a mere 87 votes. Following this humiliating experience, the party never contested elections again.
Split.
PAN suffered a split in 1941. A group of Executive Committee members met on August 13, 1941 and voted to demote Méndez from his post as party chairman. Effectively two groups emerged that claimed to be the legitimate PAN, the group led by Méndez and another led by Anibal Eduarte, Ignacio Suarez Peña (chairman) and Ismael Arribio. I. Bello served as general secretary of the Méndez faction. On August 15, 1941 Méndez reported to police that properties at the PAN office had been stolen by the Suarez Peña faction. The Suarez Peña group responded by appealing to the Electoral Court that they be recognized as the genuine PAN. The Suarez Peña faction held a party assembly on August 23, 1941. 49 persons signed the declaration of the assembly.
In January 1942 the Méndez faction adopted a party hymn, composed by Victor Irrazabal and Carlos Tarama.
On January 23, 1942 the Electoral Court declared that it would not take sides in the dispute in PAN, arguing that it was not possible to determine who was the legitimate claimant to the name PAN.
Reunification and dissolution.
Méndez died on June 5, 1942. Following his death the two factions were reunited in October 1942.
The party was dissolved on June 11, 1944. The few properties of the party were donated to "Nuestra Raza".

University of East London Stratford Campus

The University of East London Stratford Campus is based in and around University House, a Grade II* listed building, located in Stratford, London in the London Borough of Newham. The nearest station is Maryland.
History.
West Ham Technical Institute.
In 1892 the newly formed Borough of West Ham decided to establish a technical institute to serve the local community. Construction started on 29 October 1898, costing £45,000 to build and £15,000 to equip. Designed by Gibson and Russell in the Renaissance Revival architecture style, with added carving introduced by the foreman of construction W.B. Rhind. The frontage towards Romford Road shows figures representing Fine art and science; towards Water Lane are figures symbolical of Literature, Engineering, and Music; two female figures adorn the main entrance, and there are four figures in the niches of the square tower representing Perseverance and Industry. When complete, the building was considered one of the finest in that style, and appeared in various architecture journals of the time.
The institute was to be a “people’s university” in the words of John Passmore Edwards, speaking at the building’s opening ceremony in 1900. Under principal Albert E. Briscoe, the college provided courses in science, engineering and art. In addition, under Maud J. Foster of the L.C.C. Training School, it had a Women's Department. The Institute it established its own internal degree courses in science and engineering, which were ratified by the University of London. Day secretarial courses for girls were added in 1906, a girls Trade School in 1912, a junior engineering school for boys in 1913, and a Junior School of Arts & Crafts in 1914.
It became the West Ham Municipal college in 1921 and latterly, West Ham College of Technology.
As demand for technical education grew throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the county council created two further colleges at Walthamstow and Dagenham.
North East London Polytechnic.
In 1970, these three colleges (West Ham, Walthamstow, Dagenham) were combined as a merger of higher education colleges to create the North East London Polytechnic. Campuses were modernised and revitalised by buildings such as the Arthur Edwards building on the Stratford campus, completed in 1982. In 1988, the North East London Polytechnic became a Higher Education Institution, renamed the Polytechnic of East London in 1989.
University of East London.
In 1992, the Polytechnic of East London became the University of East London. A "new university", the UEL's history of founding institutions exemplify the developments that took place in British further and higher education policy throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The University of East London consisted of the Barking Campus (closed 2006) and the Stratford Campus.
In 1999 the University of East London Docklands Campus was opened, the first new university campus built in London for over 50 years.
Present: Stratford Campus.
The present Stratford campus of the University of East London is centred around the now Grade II* listed University House.
The campus is home to the School of Education and Communities, the Schools of Health Sport & Bioscience and the School of Psychology. The Centre for Clinical Education was opened in January 2008. Operating in partnership with the National Health Service, the centre is London's only provider of podiatric education.
Duncan House is near to the campus. It is used by the university's human resource services and by the School of Law and Social Sciences. It contains a library servicing the needs of those who attend the building.
Developments.
It is expected that in 2013 the School of Law and Social Sciences and the Institute of Performing Arts will move to a new campus, University Square Stratford, located in Stratford’s Cultural Quarter. The building will also be shared with Birkbeck College, University of London. Building began on site in July 2011 and is scheduled for completion in summer 2013, with the first students admitted for the academic year 2013/14.
In 2011 UEL appointed Make Architects to lead on the design of a new, replacement library at the Stratford Campus. The project has a budget of £13 million and a target opening date of 2013.

Early life.
Gyngell was born in Sydney, Australia. Her father was Bruce Gyngell, an Australian television executive. In her youth she was a heroin addict and an alcoholic. She has since quit both addictions and is now teetotal.
Career.

After eight years at the Cafe, she left the restaurant in 2012.

She explained later that she regretted her comments about the Michelin star, but thought that the set up at Petersham just didn't allow for the expectations of customers to be met, describing the facilities as "cooking out of a garage".

In addition, she is being backed by the same investors to head a new restaurant in London. She has already said that she would not turn down a star should one come along.

Hēmeroskopeion () was an ancient Greek city.
It was located in what is now the city of Dénia, the judicial seat of the "comarca" of Marina Alta in the province of Alicante, which is a division of the Valencian Community, Spain. Its name means watchtower in Greek and it reflects the first use of the lofty promontory as such. According to Strabo it was a small city and was founded by the Massaliot Greeks together with another two neighbouring and equally small cities, the names of which have not survived. The city was later conquered by the Romans and it was named Dianium, whence the modern name. This town was situated on the cape then called Artemisium () or Dianium (), named from a temple of Ephesia Artemis built upon it (goddess Artemis was called Diana in Latin). Apart from its strategic location the city was equally important for the iron mines that existed nearby.

Jodami

Jodami (6 April 1985 – 1 December 2008) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. A specialist steeplechaser, he ran thirty-nine time and won eighteen races in a career which lasted from March 1990 until February 1997. After winning five races over hurdles, Jodami switched to racing over fences in the autumn of 1991. In early 1993 he won four consecutive races, culminating with a win in Britain's most prestigious steeplechase, the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He also won three editions of the Hennessy Gold Cup at Leopardstown Racecourse. Jodami's racing career was ended by injury in 1997. He died in 2008.
Background.
Jodami was a bay horse bred at Ballinabanogue, County Waterford by Eamon Phelan. During his racing career, he stood just under 17 hands high and weighed 570 kg. Timeform described him as being "deep-girthed" and an "old-fashioned" type of chaser while according to Richard Edmondson of "The Independent" Jodami was "a brute of a horse, a huge and stocky animal". He was sired by Crash Course who won the Doncaster Cup and became a successful National Hunt stallion: his other progeny included Rough Quest, Esha Ness and Maid of Money (Irish Grand National).
Eamon Phelan sold Jodami as a foal, but bought him back three years later and returned him to Ballinanaogue for another year before sending him to the Tattersalls sales where the horse was sold for IR£12,500. He was later purchased privately by the Yorkshire based trainer Peter Beaumont on behalf of John Yeadon. The exact price was not made public, but according to Beaumont, "he wasn't dear (expensive) at all". Beaumont trained the horse at his Foulrice Farm stable at Brandsby near York. Beaumont had originally established himself as a trainer on the amateur point-to-point circuit and at the time of Jodami's greatest success his stable housed approximately twenty horses. Yeadon named the horse after himself and his two sons: the names of "Jo"hn, "Da"vid and "Mi"chael combining to make "Jodami".
Racing career.
1990–1992: early career.
Jodami began his racing career as a 5 year old by running in National Hunt flat races or "bumpers"; race designed for National Hunt-bred horses who lack the maturity to compete over obstacles. He won on his debut at Kelso as a 33/1 outsider before finishing fifth at Aintree and second at Ayr. In all three of his bumpers, he was ridden by Peter Beaumont's daughter, Anthea Farrell. The Aintree race was the last time that Jodami would finish a race in lower than third place for five years. After his run at Ayr, Jodami did not appear on the racecourse for nine months.
Jodami returned in January 1991 to compete in novice hurdle races and over the next three months he won five of his six races, ridden by Beaumont's son-in-law Patrick Farrell. Most of his wins were in minor races at tracks in Scotland and Northern England but on his final appearance he carried 151 pounds to a twelve length victory in a novice handicap at Ayr in which his opponents included the Mersey Novices' Hurdle winner Shannon Glen.
In the 1991/1992 season, Jodami began to compete over larger obstacles as he ran in novice chases. He won minor events at Kelso in November and January and was then stepped up in class for the Grade II West of Scotland Novices' Chase at Ayr. Starting the 11/8 favourite, he made several jumping errors but won by three lengths from the Stayers' Hurdle winner King's Curate. Eleven days later, Jodami raced in the South of England for the first time when he started odds on favourite for the Reynoldstown Novices' Chase at Ascot Racecourse. His unbeaten run of seven races came to an end as he jumped erratically and was beaten fifteen lengths by Danny Harrold. He was beaten in his two remaining novice chases, but showed better form when finishing second to Bradbury Star at Aintree and third behind Second Schedual when carrying top weight at Punchestown.
1992/1993 season: Gold Cup campaign.
Jodami's first race against experienced chasers came at Haydock Park in November 1992, when he finished second to Run For Free in the Edward Hanmer Chase a race in which he was ridden for the first time by Mark Dwyer. Run For Free went on to win the Welsh National and the Scottish Grand National later that season. He then started favourite for the British Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup Handicap Chase at Newbury Racecourse, in which his opponents included The Fellow and Party Politics, and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by Sibton Abbey. Jodami returned to Newbury in January and recorded his first success of the season in the Mandarin Handicap Chase, carrying top weight of 168 pounds to a two and a half length win over Esha Ness. After the race he was identified as a potential Gold Cup winner, and Beaumont reported that the Jodami's owner had turned down several "tempting" offers for the horse. Two weeks later, Jodami and Run For Free met again in the Peter Marsh Chase at Haydock, where the field also included the Grade I winner Gold Options and the course specialist Twin Oaks, who had won eight steeplechases at the track. Dwyer tracked Run For Free before challenging at the last fence, and Jodami took the lead in the closing stages to win by two lengths.
In February, Jodami was sent to Leopardstown Racecourse for the Hennessy Gold Cup a race which as well as being one of Ireland's major weight-for-age prizes, also serves as an important trial for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The race was dominated by the two British challengers, with Jodami prevailing by a head from the Martin Pipe-trained Chatam. After the race Beaumont expressed the view that Jodami was likely to improve further before the following month's Gold Cup and identified The Fellow as his horse's principal rival. At Cheltenham on 18 March, Jodami started at odds of 8/1 for the Gold Cup, making him the joint second favourite of the sixteen runners, but there appeared to be little confidence behind the horse, as his odds had drifted out from 4/1 on the morning of the race. The Fellow started favourite and the field also included Sibton Abbey, Run For Free and Chatam as well as the previous winners Garrison Savannah and Cool Ground. Dwyer restrained Jodami in the early stages before moving up to join the leaders on the second circuit. Over the last two fences the race resolved into a struggle between Jodami and Rushing Wild, a former hunter and point-to-pointer. Jodami overtook his rival just after the last obstacle and stayed on strongly to win by two lengths, becoming the first Northern-trained winner since The Thinker in 1987. "The Independent" described the performance as a display of "awesome power" and Dwyer confidently predicted that Jodami would win the race again.
1993–1997: later career.
Jodami took time to reach his best form in the 1993/1994 season. On his debut at Wetherby racecourse he fell for the only time in his career and then had to be driven out record a narrow success over Cab On Target in the Edward Hanmer Chase. He then started 2/7 favourite for the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow but was beaten twelve lengths into third by Party Politics, before finishing third again, behind Zeta's Lad and Run For Free in the Peter Marsh Chase. At Leopardsown, however, Jodami re-established himself as one of the best chasers as he won the Hennessy Gold Cup for a second time, beating Deep Bramble by seven lengths. Despite his inconsistent form, Jodami started 6/4 favourite for the 1994 Cheltenham Gold Cup on 17 March. Dwyer employed tactics similar to those employed in 1993, but despite finishing strongly Jodami was unable to catch The Fellow and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. Dwyer admitted that he was beaten by a better horse on the day, commenting that he was "fighting a losing battle" in the closing stages.
Jodami again ran disappointingly in the early part of the following season. He unseated Dwyer at Haydock before being pitted against the six-year-old One Man in an anticipated race for the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Wetherby. The event proved anticlimactic as One Man unseated Tony Dobbin at the fifth-last fence and Jodami falling two fences later. He was remounted to finish a distant second to the surprise winner Cogent. The highlight of Jodami's season came at Leopardstown where he won his third Hennessy Gold Cup, beating the Irish seven-year-old Merry Gale by three lengths. In this race he rallied on the flat to overtake the younger horse after looking beaten at the last fence. Dwyer received a seven day ban for excessive use of the whip in the closing stages. At Cheltenham, Jodami looked impressive before the race but failed to cope with the exceptionally heavy ground and finished eighth behind Master Oats in the Gold Cup.
Jodami won one race (at Kelso) from five starts in his 1995/1996 campaign. At the end of the season he ran two notable races in defeat in two of the year's most valuable handicaps. In April he carried 166 pounds when second in the Irish Grand National and a month later he ran fourth under 168 pounds in the Whitbread Gold Cup.
Jodami began his final season by finishing second to The Grey Monk at Ayr in November. He appeared to be in decline, but his last two races, in early 1997 showed that he was still competitive at the highest level at the age of twelve. In January, he conceded weight to his five rivals in the Peter Marsh Chase and won by a neck from Unguided Missile, a victory which saw him made favourite for the Grand National. A month later he contested the Hennessy Gold Cup for the fourth and last time. Ridden by Norman Williamson, he finished second, three lengths behind Danoli and twenty ahead of Imperial Call in third. The performance was achieved despite the fact that Jodami broke down in the closing stages and finished lame. Examinations revealed a ruptured tendon in his right foreleg, bringing an end to his racing career.
Retirement.
Jodami spent his retirement at Beaumont's stable. He took part in hunting and spent most of his time acting as a companion for young horses at Brandsby- "nannying the babies" in Beaumont's words. Jodami died on 1 December 2008 at the age of twenty-three after being injured in his stable.
Assessment and honours.
Timeform rated Jodami's Gold Cup win as the best performance in the race since Burrough Hill Lad's victory in 1984.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Jodami an "average" Gold Cup winner.

Komafest

Komafest (Norwegian: Coma party) was an urban art and graffiti event organized in Vardø, Norway. Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5 - 21 July, 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds. 
The event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist "Pøbel". Participating artists were Stephen Powers (USA), "Vhils" (Portugal), "Roa" (Belgium), Atle Østrem (Norway), "Ethos" (Brazil), "E. B. Itso", "Husk mit navn" (both Denmark), "Horfe", Ken Sortais, "Remed" (all France) and Conor Harrington (Ireland). 
Background.
Vardø is Norway's north-easternmost town. Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vardø had 2,122 inhabitants. Because of the population decline, Vardø was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. "Pøbel" wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the "Getto spedalsk" ("Ghetto leperous") project, where he and collaborator "Dolk" painted abandoned buildings in at the Lofoten islands. 
After securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name "Komafest" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity.
The festival.
Although substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. "Pøbel" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renevation and increased enthusiasm for local history. Early on, the 100 year old municipal cinema, closed for over 20 years and used as a warehouse, was cleared and used to host a lecture by author Tristan Manco and screen street art films. 
After the opening weekend, the festival secured financing, equipment and political permission to realise the long-planned idea of planting an old bus next to the underwater tunnel that leads to Vardø. The bus was previously used to transport families and their belongings out of Vardø during the era of mass de-population.

The Name of Action

Title origins.
The title of the book is derived from the famous "To be, or not to be" speech from William Shakespeare's play "Hamlet".
<poem>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action. - Soft you now!</poem>
Plot summary.
Disillusioned by Britain, wealthy youth Oliver Chant is sent abroad to Trier (Germany) by UK Communist leader Kurtz. Kurtz had been exiled to Britain by Trier's new dictator Demassener and promised Oliver Chant that he'd be part of a dramatic rebellion. Chant arrives in Trier with orders to meet up with the underground party run by a Jewish poet, Joseph Kapper and comrades Torner (an Artist) and Lintz (a shoe maker). It becomes apparent that the small faction are not interested in bloodshed, but spreading dissent against the Dictator only by literature and posters. 
By a strange turn of events the Dictator's wife, Anne-Marie Demassener enters the party's quarters seeking help from a minor car accident. She claims that her husband is more than aware of what these men do and isn't the least concerned. Oliver Chant is invited to meet her husband that night, where he witnesses the mother of an executed gun runner come pleading for her son's body. Over the course of the evening Chant becomes infatuated with the dictators wife. He heads back after the town's curfew, and after being cornered by local police is rescued by the Poet Kapper who shoots the policeman dead in the street. Kapper and Chant dispose of the body in the canal and then send Kapper's wife out with a tray of raw butcher's meat to spread over the area where the murder took place. In the morning Kapper and Chant argue over the murder, and further conflict arises when Kapper shows him the party's next propaganda poster which is a slur on the Dictator's wife. Chant vows to leave the group and the country. He visits Anne-Marie Demassener to bid farewell and state his love for her. But during his visit a Canal Boat owner enters and tells her of the murdered policeman he fished out the river. Anne-Marie presumes Chant is involved and tells him to leave the country, he makes proposals at her to come with him, which (though unhappy herself) she mockingly rejects. Chant vows to stay on in Trier and try and fight for her. Chant goes back and overruling a humiliated Kapper, leads the party on a planned rebellion. Chant arranges for a risky liaison to smuggle in arms by canal boat. Anne-Marie is destined to interfere with his plans again, making him question the motive for his involvement and giving Kapper an opportunity to lead the party to success by other means.
Repudiation.
In his autobiography "Ways of Escape" Graham Greene spoke of this book and its subsequent repudiation:
My second and third novels, "The Name of Action" and "Rumour at Nightfall", published in 1930 and 1931, can now be found, I am glad to think, only in secondhand bookshops at an exaggerated price, since some years after their publication I suppressed them. Both books are of a badness beyond the power of criticism properly to evoke—the prose flat and stilted... The main characters in a novel must necessarily have some kinship to the author, they come out of his body as a child comes from the womb, then the umbilical cord is cut, and they grow into independence. The more the author knows of his own character the more he can distance himself from his invented characters and the more room they have to grow in. With these early novels the cord has not been cut, and the author at twenty-six was as unreal to himself, in spite of psychoanalysis at sixteen, as Oliver Chant, the hero of "The Name of Action", is to the reader. Chant is only a daydream in the mind of a young romantic author, for it takes years of brooding and of guilt, of self-criticism and of self-justification, to clear from the eyes the haze of hopes and dreams and false ambitions. I was trying to write my first political novel, knowing nothing of politics. I hope I did better many years later with "The Quiet American", but how little I had learned of life and politics during three years in the sub-editors’ room of "The Times".

2009 Melbourne Football Club season

The 2009 Melbourne Football Club season was the club's 110th year in the VFL/AFL since it began in 1897.
Melbourne hosted 10 of its 11 home games at the MCG. For the third year in a row, they played their remaining home game at Manuka Oval in the nation's capital, Canberra, against the Sydney Swans during Round 17. Dean Bailey coached his second year as senior coach at Melbourne. After taking the captaincy from David Neitz in round 6 the year before with Cameron Bruce, James McDonald was made full-time captain for the season.
On 2 August, Melbourne president Jim Stynes announced he was diagnosed with cancer and would be stepping aside from his duties until the conclusion of the 2009 AFL season. Don McLardy took over as acting president for that period of time.
Melbourne continued their Debt Demolition campaign in the month of August raising $567,132 and cutting their debt to $1.5 million. Melbourne also had a yearly profit of $587,183.
Melbourne only won four matches for the year, receiving their 12th wooden spoon. Melbourne came under scrutiny in the later rounds of the season (most notably in round 18 against Richmond) for "tanking", i.e. losing games in order to receive a priority draft pick; but, after extensive investigations in 2012 and 2013, the AFL found the club not guilty of these allegations. Because the Demons won four games or fewer for the second year in a row, the club received a priority pick at the start of the 2009 National Draft.

Notes
Notable matches.
NAB Cup and NAB Challenge.
Week 1: Melbourne looked to be on the verge of causing an upset over the 2008 Premiers, Hawthorn, leading 1.8.8 (65) to 0.5.2 (32) at three-quarter time. However, the Hawks made a successful comeback, keeping the 2008 wooden spooners goal-less in the final quarter as Jarryd Roughead snatched the lead back for Hawthorn with a mark and a goal 30 seconds from full-time.
Home and away season.
Round 4: Melbourne registered their first win of the season defeating a winless Richmond by 8 points. Despite holding a 31 point lead at half time, the Demons held off a fast finishing Tigers outfit in the final quarter to secure their first win against a Victorian team since round 22, 2007. It was also Melbourne's first win as the "away" side since round 14, 2007.
Round 10: Melbourne put up a brave first half effort against an undefeated St Kilda, trailing by only 8 points at the main break. However, the Saints kept Melbourne goalless in the second half to finish out comfortable winners by 27 points.
Round 11: In the Queen's Birthday clash, the 2008 number 1 draft pick Jack Watts made his debut against Collingwood. He received a harsh welcoming to the AFL when he came off from the interchange bench for the first time in the game: Watts was immediately crunched by the larger bodies of three Collingwood players while the ball came his direction, as Melbourne suffered its biggest loss for the season (66 points).
Round 12: Liam Jurrah (the first AFL player from a remote tribal community) made his AFL debut, against Essendon. He kicked his first goal with a marking attempt that turned into a falling crumb in the goal-square. This goal was nominated for Goal of the Year. Melbourne were out-classed by the Bombers, losing easily by 48 points.
Round 14: On 2 July, in an emotional press conference, Melbourne president Jim Stynes announced that he was diagnosed with cancer and had to step down as president for the rest of the season. Melbourne played its most emotional game of the year against West Coast and recorded its highest first quarter score of the season. Despite a late charge by the Eagles in the final quarter, Melbourne resisted the attack and won the game by 20 points. After the match, the players headed into the dressing rooms holding up Stynes' infamous number 37 guernsey, which he wore during the 1987 Preliminary Final against Hawthorn. Jack Grimes received the NAB Rising Star nomination for round 14.
Round 15: Melbourne won consecutive games for the first time since round 11, 2007 when it downed Port Adelaide by 11 points, after holding a 30 point lead midway through the third quarter. Liam Jurrah received the NAB Rising Star nomination for Round 15.
Round 18: In a match that was criticised for tanking strategies, Jordan McMahon took a mark in Richmond's forward 50 and goaled after the final siren to give the Tigers a 4 point win. During the game Melbourne coach Dean Bailey placed several players in unusual positions. These included placing ruckman Paul Johnson and midfielder James McDonald in the backline; playing forward Brad Miller in the ruck; placing defenders James Frawley and Matthew Warnock in the forward line, as well as leaving Russell Robertson and Colin Sylvia out of the game for Michael Newton and rookie Jake Spencer.
Round 20: In front of a crowd of only 13,004, Melbourne inflicted its only thrashing of the season against fellow cellar dwellers Fremantle after a blowout in the second quarter to win by 63 points. They would record its first 60 point victory since round 8, 2006 as well as the first time they scored 20 or more goals in a game since round 22, 2007.
Round 22: Veterans Russell Robertson, Paul Wheatley and Matthew Whelan played their last ever AFL match, against ladder leaders St Kilda. Melbourne put on another strong first half performance, trailing by only a goal at half time, which included a backwards goal from Liam Jurrah at the start of the quarter. However, St Kilda ran over the top of Melbourne in the second half, winning comfortably by 47 points to secure the minor premiership. Melbourne, on the other hand, received the wooden spoon and ensured that their priority pick would be safe. They had the first and second picks in the 2009 AFL draft.

<doc id="36575759" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36575759" title="Thomas de Rokeby (died 1356)">
Thomas de Rokeby (died 1356)

Sir Thomas de Rokeby (died 1356) was a leading soldier and Crown official in fourteenth-century England who served as Justiciar of Ireland. He had considerable early success in restoring order to Ireland, but was recalled after the situation deteriorated, although he returned shortly before his death.
Background.
The Rokebys were a well known landowning family from North Yorkshire; Thomas was probably the son of the Thomas de Rokeby who died in 1318. His nephew, also Thomas, was closely associated with him in his later years and the elder was often called "l'oncle" to distinguish him from his nephew. It was probably the nephew, not the uncle who was the grandfather of the Sir Thomas de Rokeby who died c.1423.
Service in Scotland.
Rokeby first came to public attention in 1327 when, having been a prisoner in Scotland he received a reward from the new King Edward III of England as the man who first pointed out the approach of the Scots army; he was knighted and given lands worth £100 a year. He saw action against the Scots regularly between 1336 and 1342 and had charge of Stirling Castle and Edinburgh Castle while they were held by the English. He was High Sheriff of Yorkshire 1342-1349. He was one of the English commanders at the Battle of Neville's Cross, and it was said, "gave the Scots such a draught as they did not care to taste again". He was then charged with bringing King David II of Scotland to London and received further grants of land.
Justiciar of Ireland.
In 1349 he was appointed Justiciar of Ireland with a large armed retinue as it was recognised that "Ireland is not in good plight or good peace". He arrived in December and made a quick circuit of the south, mainly to keep watch on the troublesome magnate Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond
Administrative reforms.
Rokeby was praised for his regard for justice and his zeal in checking the extortion of Crown officials. He undertook what has been called a general overhaul of the Irish administration, aimed particularly at the detection of corruption and the removal of incompetent officials. Arguably he showed excessive zeal in arresting the Treasurer of Ireland, Robert de Emeldon, a man who enjoyed the King's personal regard; Admittedly the charges against Emeldon were very serious, including rape, robbery and manslaughter, but the King had already pardoned Emeldon for killing a man, and he was once more pardoned and quickly released. 
In November 1351 Rokeby held a Great Council at Kilkenny. It dealt partly with the problem of official corruption already described, partly with the problem of defence, and partly with the question of intermarriage or other contacts with the Old Irish. Otway-Ruthven notes that little of the legislation was new, apart from the application of the English Statute of Labourers, and that much of it was repeated in the later Statutes of Kilkenny
Military campaigns.
In 1353 the clan MacCarthy of Muskerry, which had until then been loyal to the Crown, rebelled. Rokeby showed considerable skill in crushing the rebellion and replacing the rebellious chieftain Dermot MacCarthy with his more compliant cousin Cormac, ancestor of the Earl of Clancarty.
This promising state of good order did not last: a rebellion by the O'Byrne clan of Wicklow in 1354 was followed by a general uprising headed by the MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty. Although Muirchearteach MacMurrough-Kavanagh, styled King of Leinster, was captured and executed Rokeby suffered several defeats. He was unable to overcome the O'Byrnes in Wicklow, and other risings took place in Tipperary, Kildare and Ulster.
Recall and last years.
Rokeby was now an ageing and discouraged man, and in 1355 it was decided to recall him. His replacement, rather surprisingly, was that Earl of Desmond whom it had been one of his main tasks to keep in check. Desmond however died a year later and Rokeby was reappointed Justiciar, only to die himself at Kilkea Castle.
Character.
Rokeby was a popular and respected figure: "one who paid well for his victuals, and did not rob the poor". The citizens of Cork, protesting at his recall, referred to his "evident good work" in maintaining law and order. Otway-Ruthven however contrasts his early successes with his disappointing later record and notes that the 1350s was later seen as the crucial decade in which the Crown finally lost control of much of Ireland.

<doc id="36575771" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36575771" title="Rendezvous (fur trade)">
Rendezvous (fur trade)

In North American history, a rendezvous was a larger meeting held typically once per year in the wilderness. All types included a major transfer of furs and goods to be traded for furs. Variations included a mix of other types of trading, business transactions, business meetings and revelry.
In canoe-based fur trade areas.
One type of rendezvous is associated with the voyageur & canoe-based fur trade business which was largely in Canada. These were generally at a transportation transfer point within in a wilderness route that could not be traversed in one season run by and including the fur trade of only a single company. The transfer was the dominant reason for holding the rendezvous although they included other meetings and revelry.
In the western part of what is now the United States.
Rendezvous held in the western part of what is now the United States included a more diverse range of activities than their northern counterparts. Such a rendezvous might include several fur trading companies, and array of fur traders, mountain men and native Americans. A substantial amount of deal-making and trading occurred at these rendezvous. These were often a temporary "town" of sorts where with businesses which offered the fur trade workers and participants ways to spend their money on supplies and revelry. The emblematic type was a large annual rendezvous held in the Rocky mountains from 1825 until 1840. One of the largest of these was the Rendezvous of 1832. Much of the attendance of these consisted of mountain men who were fur trade participants who were experienced at living in the mountain back country.
Modern rendezvous.
Historical fur trade rendezvous are the basis or inspiration for rendezvous that are held today. Some of these (such as those held by buckskinners) are historical re-enactments to varying degrees; others are not reenactments but are inspired by elements of historical rendezvous.

Rareș Dumitrescu

Rareș Dumitrescu (; born 24 December 1983 in Brașov) is a Romanian sabre fencer, World silver medal in 2009. With the Romanian team he was European champion in 2006, World champion in 2009 and Olympic team silver medal in 2012.
Personal life.
Dumitrescu discovered fencing at age ten by circumstance: his mother, a teacher, had a pupil whose father was a fencing coach. He began training at his local club CS Tractorul under Cătălin Albu, who also served as sparring partner in the absence of other sabre fencers in Brașov: the Olympic center was in Iași. He was also frustrated by a lack of money: his parents had to pay for his travel expenses and entrance fees when he began competition. He did not have dedicated fencing shoes either and wore out dozens of ordinary trainers on the piste. The hard training regimen almost made him quit fencing when he was in high school, but he persevered and transferred in 2003 to CS Dinamo București.
Dumitrescu graduated in 2006 from the Faculty of physical education and sport of the Transilvania University of Brașov and earned in 2008 a master's degree in marketing and sport management from the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Iași. He married in 2009 his high school girlfriend.
Career.
Dumitrescu earned his first major title in 2005 with a team bronze medal at the European Championships in Zalaegerszeg. In March 2006 he got on the podium for the first time in a World Cup event with a silver medal in Athens. He also won the European Champion Clubs' Cup with CS Dinamo. A few months later he earned a team gold medal at the European Championships in Izmir.
In 2008 Dumitrescu won his first World Cup title in Madrid. He made his Olympic debut in the Beijing Games, but was eliminated in the table of 16 by France's Julien Pillet. He was again tempted to retire because he was tired of commuting between Brașov and Bucharest, but his former team mate Mihai Covaliu, now coach of the national team, persuaded him to go on.
In 2009 he won two World Cup stages in Budapest and Warsaw. He was eliminated early in the individual event of the European Championships in Plovdiv, but took the silver medal with Romania. At the World Championships in Antalya he made his way to the final, where he was defeated by Germany's Nicolas Limbach and took the silver medal. He was noted for his “fighting spirit and his intelligence” as well as his technical progress. In the team event Romania created an upset by beating favourites Germany, France and Hungary to meet Italy in the final. Dumitrescu entered for the last bout on 40–34 for Italy and beat Aldo Montano 11–4 to win Romania their first World gold medal in sabre. Dumitrescu finished the 2008–09 season number two in FIE rankings. For this performance he was granted the title of master emeritus in sport.
At the men's sabre competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics Dumitrescu was beaten in the match for the third place by Nikolay Kovalev and missed the podium, but won a silver medal in the team sabre event. He retired after the Games to become a coach at CS Dinamo.

2012 Vintage Yachting Games – Europe Female

The Europe Female was an event on the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games program at Lake Como, Italy. Five out of the nine scheduled race were scheduled. 11 sailors, on 11 boats, from 4 nations entered. The event was started together with the Europe Male event. However separate scores were given.
Venue overview.
Race area and Course.
Of the three Campo's (Race Area's) available for the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games at Lake Como Campo Bravo was used for the Europe Female event. In general this Campo is situated in front of the city of Dervio.
For the 2012 edition of the Vintage Yachting Games three different courses were available. The Europe Female could only use course 3.
Wind conditions.
The Northern part of Lake Como was reportedly a thermic wind venue. In this time of year the normal situation is that at about 13:00 the Swiss mountains are heated up and a Southern wind hits the racing areas with about 10 to 14 knots. As result of this no races were scheduled in the morning. Unfortunately during the event the temperature in Switzerland was low during the Vintage. Also was the thermal South breeze battling with the gradient wind from the North. As result the actual wind did not came above the 8 knots during the races and was instable at times.
Campo Bravo has normally a tendency to have a slightly higher wind speed than the two other Campo's this due to the fact that it is more Northern than Charlie so that the Southern thermal breeze is strengthened and that the fact that the lake narrows in front of Dervio.
Races.
Summary.
In the Europe Female at Campo Bravo only five races could be completed.
In the Europe class, Olympic from 1992 – 2004, the female and male event started as one fleet in this Vintage. Of cause they had separate results.
By the female participants, Janika PULS, Germany, got a lead of 8 points over her opponent Anne-Line LYBGSØ THOMSEN from Denmark. Anna LIVBJERG also from Denmark took bronze. The fourth race was decisive.

Baron Armand-Marie Ghislain Limnander van Nieuwenhove (b. 22 May 1814 in Ghent, Belgium – d. 15 August 1892 at the Château de Moignanville, a village in the department of Seine-et-Oise, France) was a Belgian composer of choral and orchestral works and church music. Knight of the Order of Leopold, he was the founder and conductor of the choral chamber ensembles "Société Symphonique" and "Réunion Lyrique" in Belgium.
Biography.
Born to a family who formerly belonged to the bar of the late Council of Flanders, ennobled in 1683, Armand Limnander van Nieuwenhoven was raised in the village of Malines.

From 1838 to 1847 he conducted with great distinction the direction of an amateur choral society entitled "Rèunion Lyrique" composed of 25 members, for which he wrote a number of musical pieces for male voices and which eventually came to establish his reputation in festivals and competitions.
In 1845, prompted by the desire to work for the stage, he left for Paris. The following year he performed at the chateau des Tuileries, in the presence of King Louis Philippe I, three choir excerpts from his "Scènes druidiques" with orchestral accompaniment under the direction of Daniel Auber. In 1847 Limnander decided to settle in the French capital, where his dramas and lyrical operas such as "The Montenegrins" (1848), by librettists Gérard de Nerval and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol, which premiered there on 31 March the following year, was very well received along with his "Le Château de la Barbe-Bleue" (1851). In the course of 1853 the composer was working on two books, one for the Opera House and the other to the Opéra-Comique of Paris. The first of these pieces "Le Maitre à Chanter," a grand opera in two acts set to a libretto of Henri Trianon, choreographed by Joseph Mazilier, successfully premiered at the Academy of Music on 17 October 1853.
His opera "Yvonne" (1859), set to a libretto by Eugène Scribe, premiered at the "Theatre de l'Opéra-Comique" on 29 November 1859 and was also well received. 
His religious music is composed of a Te Deum, performed in 1845 on the anniversary of the avencement to the throne of King Leopold, a Requiem, written in honor of the citizens killed in the upheaval of 1830 and performed in Brussels in September 1852, the Stabat Mater "La Messe de minuit," performed by the choir "Harmonie à Bruxelles" in April 1853, during the political majority of Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, and a national song for full orchestra with text by André Henri Constant van Hasselt, written for the celebration of the national festivities in Brussels in 1855.

Lose Your Love

"Lose Your Love" is a 1985 single by English synthpop duo Blancmange. The song was released as the second of three singles from the band's third studio album "Believe You Me".
Background.
After the previous leading single "What's Your Problem?" peaked at #40 in the UK, "Lose Your Love" showed a big decline in Blancmange's popularity, with the single peaking at #77 for a total of 2 weeks in the UK. It fared better in America, where it peaked at #2 on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs Chart.
In the official American Billboard Magazine of December 14, 1985, the song was listed under the Hot Dance/Disco section, based on club play and sales. The song was listed under "Breakouts", explaining that the single had future potential, based on club play for the week.
In the 1986 Sci-Fi film "Flight of the Navigator", Blancmange appear on David's TV with the music video for "Lose Your Love" when he is introduced to music videos by Carolyn, played by a young Sarah Jessica Parker.
Release.
"Lose Your Love" was remixed for the single version, instead of using exactly the same version as the album version. The single's B-Side was the instrumental album track "John", also taken from "Believe You Me". Like "Lose Your Love", the track was also written by Arthur and Luscombe.
The single was released in the UK, Canada, Japan and all throughout Europe via London Records, whilst it was released in America through Sire Records.
For all 7" vinyl versions of the single, the single's B-Side was "John", whilst an American promotional 7" vinyl release featured an edit of "Lose Your Love" by John Luongo, with the B-Side being the "LP Version" of "Lose Your Love".
In the UK only, a special 2x 7" vinyl gatefold sleeve pack was released, featuring the bonus 7" vinyl, with an extended remix of the previous 1983 hit single "That's Love That It Is" and "Game Above My Head (Extended Remix)", a remix of an album track from the band's 1983 album "Mange Tout".
For the UK 12" vinyl, the "Extended Version" of "Lose Your Love" was used, a 10 minute remix, whilst the B-Side "John" was added along with the track "Mixing on the Ceiling", another 10 minute track that is a Medley of various hit tracks by the band, mixed by Alan "The Judge" Coulthard of Disco Mix Club UK. A promotional 12" version was also released in the UK, using the same track listing.
The 12" vinyl release in France used the same track listing as used in the UK, although "Lose Your Love" was titled "(No, No, No) Lose Your Love (Extended Version)" whilst the "Mixing on the Ceiling" was titled "Mixing on the Ceiling (Megamix)". In Germany, the 12" vinyl release used the same track listing as the UK, but removed the instrumental "John". It also exclusively featured yellow coloured vinyl.
In Canada, two promotional 12" vinyl samplers were issued, one featuring the same edit of "Lose Your Love" as on the American promotional 7" vinyl. It appeared on both sides of the vinyl. The other promotional 12" vinyl featured "Lose Your Love (This Club Mix)" as the A-Side, a near seven-minute remix, whilst the edit of "Lose Your Love" appeared as the B-Side.
In America only, a specially-priced maxi 12" vinyl single featured the "Extended Version" of "Lose Your Love", whilst the B-Side was by West India Company, a band relating to Blancmange, and featuring Luscombe. The track was an "Extended Version" of "Ave Maria", featuring Vince Clarke as guest musician on pyrotechnics. "Ave Maria (Om Ganesha)" was originally the West India Company's debut single in 1984.
For the single's artwork in the UK and America, the sleeve read out the band's name and song title via a Snellen eye chart theme, also using background colours black and white on each side of the sleeve. A similar theme was used for the Dutch and Japanese 7" vinyl release, although both releases differ from the original sleeve, using a plain white background colour instead. In Canada, the artwork featured a shot taken from the same shoot as for the "Believe You Me" album, featuring the band posing. The German and French 12" vinyl cover uses a plain white background like the Dutch 7" vinyl release, although it differs slightly.
The song was later included on four Blancmange compilations, the 1994 compilation "The Third Course", the 1996 compilation "Best of Blancmange", the 2006 compilation "The Platinum Collection" and the 2012 compilation "The Very Best of Blancmange".
Promotion.
Aside from a music video, the song was performed with live vocal on TV and during live performances.
Music video.
A music video was created for the single, featuring the duo inside a house, where throughout the video they trash every bit of furniture they can get their hands on. By the end of the video, the house is a victim of demolition.
Upon release, the video was banned by both UK broadcasting companies BBC and ITV, as well as America's MTV, due to the violence.
The video was filmed in New York and was made by the same director who also created the video for the Art of Noise hit "Close (To The Edit)".
Since being unofficially uploaded on YouTube in early 2007, the video has gained approximately 160,000 views.
In a mid-2011 interview with Neil Arthur, the song's video was mentioned. Arthur stated ""We had great fun making the video for that, many years ago. We flew over to New York to film it. The video got banned by ITV and the BBC for 'inciting violence in the home'. Because we were smashing up things. It was ridiculous.""
After the interviewer commented that the duo always looked like they were having fun with their videos, Arthur stated 
"It was always like that, having a lot of fun. Even that "studio" one for 'Lose Your Love' was like that ... we hired an old, abandoned terminal in Manhattan—each room was a different scenario. And then we went upstate and pulled a house down for the finale! An old house was going to be demolished—and we filmed it being pulled down. There was supposed to be another scene with us outside the house in daylight, but we were stopped by law enforcement for speeding, got delayed."
Critical reception.
In the official American Billboard Magazine of December 14, 1985, the 12-inch remix of "Lose Your Love" was mentioned under the "Dance Trax" section. The article stated ""The epic-length remix of "Lose Your Love" (Sire 12-inch) suggests that a new, artier form of high-energy may be emerging...""

Sicilian Questions

Sicilian Questions, "al-Masa'il al-Siqiliyya" in Arabic, is the name of Ibn Sabin's masterpiece, one of the leading representatives of the Andalusian mystic of the 13th century. Its doctrines are marked by the influence of two great philosophical areas, the Peripateticism and Sufism, which makes it a very interesting writing for researchers and scholars. This work contains the answer given by him to some philosophical questions raised by the famous Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1215 -1250) and has been defined as "symbol on the intellectual relations between medieval Christian Europe and the Islamic world". 
On the "Sicilian Questions" exist, so far, the complete editions of Serefettin Yaltkaya, according to the 534th Arabic manuscript from the Bodleian Library at Oxford; and several complete translations: to Turkish, to Italian, and to Spanish; as well as diverse partial translations: to French, to Italian, to Spanish, and to German.
Regarding the author's style, the book has obvious signs of eloquence and elegance, as well as extensive scientific knowledge. But at the same time, it warns, sometimes, a certain monotony, excessive rhetoric, with consequent abrupt interruptions retakes, disjunctions, etc. Through its pages shows us the philosophical universe from Ibn Sabin, with a strong mix of Aristotelian influence of Neoplatonic and Sufi mysticism, and an overview of the most important doctrines of the science of antiquity, including For example, the logic of Aristotle.
Structure.
The treatise is divided into a prologue, wrote perhaps one of his disciples, which explains the origin of the correspondence, the answer to the four philosophical questions raised by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, a Appendix referred to several issues, and finally, an epilogue. These parts are of variable length and are subdivided, in turn, into several sections. Given, then, that its structure is as follows: 
As usual in medieval Arabic treatises, and how could it be otherwise, if we take into account the rich and highly educated of Ibn Sabin, in the "Sicilian Questions" the author quotes from other writers, especially those in the classical antiquity, among them are, for example, Plato's Phaedrus and especially those belonging to the logic of Aristotle, as the most relevant. 
Similarly, and for the same reason, makes frequent references to ancient philosophers and thinkers, to a greater extent, but also to his fellow followers of other faiths and representatives of the most varied theories and doctrines, explained or simply commented on the work, which make it a rich melting pot of scientific knowledge to justify the time and interest in it. Among all these philosophers, he notes, the volume of citations is made on his thought and his writings, Aristotle, which is really central to the treaty and the Andalusian mystic most often named as the Wise ("al-Hakim") and the Man ("al-Rayul"). 
Other important philosophers and thinkers in the "Sicilian Questions" referred to are, in alphabetical order, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Anaxagoras, Berosus, Crates, Diogenes, Euclid, Al-Farabi, Galen, Al-Ghazali, Al-Hallaj, Ibn Bajja (Avempace) Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Iamblichus, Mellow, Parmenides, Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, Themistius, Theophrastus, and Zeno of Elea. 
The masterful character of the work lies at the confluence of all these philosophical currents which combine great diversity of theories and beliefs.

Samuel Garbett

Samuel Garbett (1717– 5 December 1803) was a prominent citizen of Birmingham England, during the industrial revolution, and a friend of Matthew Boulton. Historian Carl Chinn argues that he:
Garbett's education extended:
Garbett was employed by a London merchant named Hollis, as his agent for purchasing goods in Birmingham. In that role, he came:
He married Anne Clay (d. 1772) of Aston in August 1735.
He then made his fortune as a merchant in his own right, before entering partnership with Dr John Roebuck to set up a laboratory in Steelhouse Lane where precious metals were refined and assayed; a manufacturing centre for sulphuric acid in Prestonpans in 1749; and, with others, the Carron Iron Works, in Scotland, in 1760, in which the two Birmingham men each held a 25% share. He also chaired, from January 1788, a Birmingham committee against the slave trade.
His eldest child and only daughter Mary married Charles Gascoigne in 1759, and in 1765 Gascoigne became a partner in the Carron works, having been manager of Garbett's nearby turpentine factory, Garbett & Co., since 1763.
Garbett was involved in the creation of Birmingham Assay Office in 1773, and was the first chairman of Birmingham's Commercial Committee, forerunner of successive Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, as was a member of the committee that raised funds to create Birmingham General Hospital.
He was declaredbankrupt in 1782. Boulton encouraged him to re-establish his business in Birmingham, which he did successfully.
At his death in 1803, his estate was over £12,000, albeit with some creditors not discharged. He was buried at St Philip's Church (later Birmingham's cathedral), where he had been a church warden. Matthew Boulton wrote of him:
Throughout his life, Garbett played a prominent part in local politics and affairs, including police proposals and the development of Birmingham's canals. During the Birmingham riots of 1791, it was at his house in Newhall Street that the town and country gentry held their emergency meetings. His political lobbying in general, and correspondence with Shelburne in particular, make him a significant figure in national politics.

History.
Abe District was one of the original districts of Suruga Province. Modern Abe District was established in the July 22, 1878 cadastral reforms initiated by the Meiji government with one town (Shizuoka) and 114 villages. In a round of consolidation on April 1, 1889, Shizuoka was elevated to city status, and the number of villages was reduced to 15 villages. However, on April 1, 1896, Udo District was merged with Abe District, bringing in two towns (Shimizu and Irie) and raising the total number of villages to 23.
Irie Town merged with the towns of Irie and Tsuji from Haibara District on January 13, 1924. However, Irie then merged with Shimizu to form the city of Shimizu on February 11 of the same year.
The city of Shizuoka gradually annexed the remaining 20 villages between 1928 and 1968. On January 1, 1969, Abe District was formally dissolved after the remaining villages of Ōkōchi, Umegashima, Tamakawa, Ikawa, Kiyosawa, and Ōkawa merged in the city of Shizuoka.

The establishment of the college was proposed 1850 in a speech given at Sharon Female College by Thomas C. Thornton, then president of the nearby Brandon College in Brandon, Mississippi. He offered to transfer the charter and assets of Brandon College to the town of Sharon on the condition that a building for the new school, to be named Madison College, be provided. Thornton was the first president, as well as "professor of moral and intellectual science and sacred literature." Madison College offered the following degrees: A. B., A. M., D. D., and LL D.
The college suspended operations during the civil war. It reopened after the war but closed in 1872, "perishing for want of endowment and patronage."

1972 Qir earthquake

The 1972 Qir earthquake occurred at 05:37 local time (02:06 UTC) on April 10, 1972. It had a magnitude of 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX ("Violent") on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicentre was in the province of Fars in southern Iran. The earthquake caused the destruction of Qir and serious damage to towns and villages in the surrounding area. The estimated number of deaths is 5,374, with a further 1,710 injured.
Tectonic setting.
The earthquake occurred in the Fars Domain of the Zagros fold and thrust belt, which forms part of the collisional zone between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Fars Domain lies at the southeastern end of the Zagros and is part of the 'simply folded belt', which is characterised by detachment folding over the late Neoproterozoic Hormuz salt layer. Most earthquakes have epicenters beneath the salt layer and are thought to represent reverse faulting in the underlying basement, possibly involving the reactivation of older rift faults.
Earthquake.
The earthquake is thought to have been caused by rupture along a WNW-ESE trending reverse fault. The focal mechanism suggests that the reverse fault is moderately-dipping to either south or north.
The earthquake was preceded by a series of foreshocks in March 1972, which caused some of the inhabitants of Hingam and Karzin to move out of their houses.
Damage.
Initial casualty reports (compiled on April 28, 1972) showed that there were 3,399 deaths in Qir (two-thirds of the population), with a further 889 injured. There were 400 deaths in Gavakei (almost half of the population) and a further 300 in Bian (a third of the population) and 150 in Sekehravan (about a quarter of the population). The total number of deaths based on initial reports was 5,374 with a further 1,710 injured.
The methods of construction used in that affected area led to the high levels of damage. Most buildings were built of adobe brick with a relatively heavy flat roof of thick date palm beams resting directly on the brick walls. The addition of layers of mud and straw for waterproofing increased the load on the walls. These structures have a very low resistance to earthquake shaking and most of the deaths occurred due to the collapse of such buildings. More modern types of construction generally fared little better, as they were not properly engineered and lacked many of the elements that would have made them more resistant. Even some of the engineered buildings were badly damaged due to poor design and construction techniques, such as a lack of anchoring between the steel roof I-beams and the reinforced concrete tie-beams on which they rested. One structure, the Shahabad bridge that was well-engineered and constructed using modern techniques, was almost undamaged, compared to the adobe houses in a neighbouring village, all of which collapsed.
The earthquake caused damage to qanats (water tunnels), with the destruction of 180 wells. The flow of some springs was disrupted.

Jade Magnet

Jade Magnet is an online Crowdsourcing platform for creative and marketing support services. It was founded in 2009 by Sitashwa Srivastava and Manik Kinra. The company is headquartered in Bangalore, India and has white label partnerships in Qatar as Mixilion and in Singapore as id8on.
Jade Magnet crowdsources design requirements for marketing campaigns (logos, websites, brochures, print ads, animation videos) to freelancers, professionals, small agencies and technology from teams across the world. Initially established as an open crowdosurcing platform, Jade Magnet moved to a “managed Crowdsourcing” model in 2013 wherein the company curates teams of designers from the crowd to provide solutions to its clients’. It offers delivery assurance to its clients and handles the full project management, payments and legal contracts of crowdsourced output.
Crowdsourcing gives businesses the option of choosing from multiple design possibilities, while at the same time, creates money-making opportunities for those with a creative bent-of-mind and a technology background. Businesses sourcing marketing and design requirements from Jade Magnet get to select from multiple designs submitted by different designers or “providers” to whom the task gets posted as a contest. In this way, the platform enables customers to extract multiple options for creative solutions before making a final selection. Crowdsourcing designers also makes available a larger pool of the best available talent from among freelancers, who would otherwise not be available within a single organisation or agency.
Designers can apply to become providers on the Jade Magnet network, and are then invited participate in live internal contests the ones that are of interest to them. Jade Magnet also sources designers and artists by visiting art schools and design colleges where there is a ready community willing to participate in any invitation for crowdsourcing ideas. Providers who perform well on projects and receive good customer feedback can become Jade Magnet Champions, which ensures them a steady stream of projects. Jade Magnet has developed a community engagement system for all providers (students, moonlighters, small agencies and freelancers), offering introductory skill appraisals, appraisal and accreditation based on client feedback and opportunities for creative skill enhancement. Some Jade Magnet providers are based in tier-2 cities of India and make a living with work coming from the platform.
Company History.
Jade Magnet was co-founded by Sitashwa Srivastava and Manik Kinra, who were classmates at the Great Lakes Institute of Management. The company was born out of their idea to develop a crowdsourcing platform, based on the notion that solutions coming from a physically disconnected world could still serve business needs if channelized properly.
The idea behind establishing the company was to tap the market space comprising millions of small and medium businesses around the world which need creative support in their marketing campaigns but are unable to work with large creative agencies due to budget constraints. Crowdsourcing could cater to the needs of all such businesses on a single platform, bridging the gap between small businesses that could not afford big agency fee, and freelancers who are always looking for creative freedom and opportunity. Also, there was an opportunity to work for large and mature businesses in search of new creative ideas for their marketing campaigns and willing to experiment with more people than traditional agencies can provide.
Contest Based Platform.
Under a pilot program for testing the business model by the name of creADivity, the founders brought on-board 45 providers and got their first five customers. In July 2008, creADivity got selected for The Indus Entrepreneurs’ (TiE) Entrepreneurial Acceleration Program (EAP), which selects one or two startup companies every year and assists in funding, mentoring and networking to support them. The program provides role models in successful entrepreneurs, and helps with the support required by early-stage entrepreneurs.
Joining the TiE Program also helped Manik and Sitashwa raise initial seed funding, with the help of which they launched the platform, rebranded by the name of Jade Magnet, on 15 October 2009. The name was changed from CreADivity since it was observed that people found it difficult to pronounce the name and place the brand. The company’s new name was derived from Jade - a precious stone with sacred connotations in many cultures, and Magnet that signifies an ability to pull towards itself anything that comes close to it. The design of the company's logo itself was the result of a crowdsourcing exercise, where multiple designers created more than 15 design options. The logo that was finally chosen symbolizes high-value by juxtaposing “a” and “g” together (“Ag” is the scientific name of silver), with the "g" falling slightly to represent the magnetic force of gravity.
Under the contest –based platform, customers looking crowdsourced design requirements could register on the website and post a project. Jade Magnet set a minimum payout limit for categories of creative projects, below which market dynamics have shown that there are no takers for given tasks. Customers post projects for a budget above the pre-set minimum, 80% of which is paid out to the winning entry. Once the project was posted as a contest, it received a number of entries from providers registered on the platform. Customers then shortlisted up to five entries from these and made a final choice after any modifications.
Providers looking to participate in design contests on the Jade Magnet platform registered on the website. Registered designers could participate in the projects of their interest and submit their work in response to the posted requirements. The client selected the design which was found most appropriate.
In its first three years of establishment, Jade Magnet got on board around 8000 freelancers and small agencies in its network, delivered more than 2000 design and technology projects to nearly 1000 customers, and awarded about $650,000 as prize money to designers.
Managed Crowdsourcing.
After trying out the open crowdsourcing model and a closed group delivery assurance for a few years, Jade Magnet moved to a Managed Crowdsourcing model in 2013, where they create teams of experts by bringing together the best providers. This helps get the best designs out as the first step from multiple designers and then work with the team to deliver the output to the client. Crowdsourcing thus helps businesses get access to a larger pool of the best available talent from among freelancers, who would otherwise not be available within a single organisation or agency.
Joint ventures.
Mixilion.
In September 2012, Jade Magnet entered the Middle East with a joint venture as Mixilion, which is headquartered in Doha (Qatar). Mixilion is the Middle East's first crowdsourcing platform and provides solutions to SMEs in the region using Jade Magnet’s technology back end and a localized delivery assurance model.
id8on.
In October 2012, Jade Magnet entered into a joint venture with a technology firm in Singapore as id8on, with the help of which it expanded its operations in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.
Products.
The creative marketing solutions provided by Jade Magnet include- 
Platform technology.
The key to scaling the crowdsourcing business lies in automation of as many crowd-management processes as possible and Jade Magnet has created, executed, analyzed and fine-tuned many such processes. Jade Magnet is built on the Symfony framework with a MySQL back-end. The platform is a cloud-hosted application at Amazon Web Services. Jade Magnet is building a new sales support and portfolio application that organizes collateral designs by category and cost to enable Jade Magnet sales team and account managers close deals faster. It doubles up as a design showcase for provider portfolios at Jade Magnet.
Benefits from crowdsourcing.
Scholars of crowdsourcing suggest that there are intrinsic and extrinsic motivations that inspire people to contribute to crowdsourced tasks, and numerous incentives for businesses to get their requirements crowdsourced.
Jade Magnet’s model has proved that there are several benefits for both the customers and the providers using the crowdsourcing platform. They have estimated that their SME clients have collectively been able to save around $350,000 in about two and half years by crowdsourcing their creative marketing requirements instead of getting the work done through traditional agencies. 
Crowdsourcing has become the popular choice over small and medium advertising agencies, since it makes available a larger variety of options at a comparatively low cost of design. In crowdsourcing, overheads are minimal due to which costs for smaller and simpler projects come down drastically.For SMEs, lower costs, without a corresponding drop in quality, is a major incentive to crowd-source.
Jade Magnet claims to have helped businesses to reach out to creative people across India (including tier-2 and tier-3 cities) and four more countries. It has enabled companies to generate creative solutions within a span as short as three days, and helped small and medium businesses reach their target customers instead of making huge investments in creating a market for themselves 
Crowdsourcing has also opened up opportunities to thousands of creative designers from remote corners of India, who can enjoy the advantages of creative freedom combined with the flexibility to work at their own pace. Some providers have started earning regular income from crowdsourcing, even earning more than their previous jobs.

During World War II, he was imprisoned at the concentration camps in France from which he was deported to Nazi Germany for forced labour in a Junkers factory. Soon after, Gestapo deported him to Braunschweig at Neuengamme concentration camp. Through the already established channels for the return of Spanish volunteers in the country, Domany managed to escape and returned to Zagreb, and immediately was involved in the fight against Nazism. In August 1941, he helped organize the Partisan units in Kordun. Soon after he was appointed as the commander of the second Partisan Kordun detachment. With his detachment he was involved in fights for Slunj, Vojnić, Veljun and Plaški.
At the beginning of 1942, Italian fascists, with help from Chetniks, captured Domany with fellow fighters Drago Štajnberger, Branko Latas and Stevo Čuturilo. All of them were killed by the Chetniks, and afterwards their bodies were thrown into the 380-meter deep pit of Balinka.
On July 24, 1953, Domany was declared a People's Hero of Yugoslavia by Josip Broz Tito.
The four men's bodies were found in 1966 by an English caving team after which they were buried in a common grave in Plaški.

Fern Persons

Fern Gwendolyn Persons (née Ball; July 27, 1910 – July 22, 2012) was an American film and television actress and a member of the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists from 1937 until her death. Her film credits included "Field of Dreams" and "Hoosiers".
Persons served on the national board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) from 1976–98. She also sat on SAG's Chicago Branch Council for forty-four years and the AFTRA Chicago Local Board for more than thirty years. Much of her work at SAG and AFTRA focused on improving the professional acting opportunities for older actors.
Biography.
Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1910, she moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, as a young girl with her family. Ball earned a Bachelor of Arts in drama from Kalamazoo College in 1933. She later received a Bachelor of Fine Arts of acting from Carnegie Institute of Technology, now called Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from both colleges. She was also awarded the Otto Kahn Prize for excellence in acting at Carnegie.
Ball met her future husband, Max Persons, while both were college students. They married in 1935. Once she graduated from Carnegie, Persons worked in Detroit in radio for a short period. The family, which now included a newborn daughter, then moved to Chicago so Persons could pursue her acting career in the latter half of the 1930s.

Riddlesdown Common

Riddlesdown Common or Riddlesdown is a 43 hectare area of green space located towards the northern end of the North Downs in the London Borough of Croydon. It is owned and maintained by the City of London Corporation, apart one small area which are owned by the London Wildlife Trust and another by Croydon Council. Most of it is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The name Riddlesdown also applies to the local district of residential housing.
History.
Discoveries of Neolithic stone axes and possible traces of Iron Age fields show that occupation goes back thousands of years. The name Riddlesdown is first recorded in 1331 as "Ridelsdoune" meaning 'cleared woodland on a hill'. In medieval time Riddlesdown and the neighbouring Kenley Common formed part of the waste land of the manor of Watendone, and the commoners rights included pasture for their livestock and gathering of materials for fuel. In the nineteenth century the coming of the railways increased the value of the land, and the lord of the manor, Edmund Byron, began enclosing the area. One local landowner, William Hall, refused to sell his land to Byron, and in 1877 Hall and his brother brought a case against Byron in the Court of Chancery for encroaching on Common Land. They were successful, William Hall then asked the Corporation of London to purchase the land to preserve it as open space. In 1883 the Corporation bought Riddlesdown and Kenley Common. They became part of the "City Commons", seven green spaces in south London managed by the City Corporation of London.
Site of Special Scientific Interest.
An area of 32 hectares is the Riddlesdown Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is the largest area of calcareous scrub in Greater London, with a herb-rich chalk grassland. It includes a disused chalk quarry which is not open to the public. It has many mature yew trees, Taxus baccata. It is one of the few places in London with juniper Juniperus communis. There are two nationally rare herbs, early gentian (Gentianella anglica) and round-headed rampion. Invertebrate species include the scarce Roesel's bush-cricket.
Wider area.
The site forms part of the "Riddlesdown to Whyteleafe countryside area", which is managed by wardens working for the City of London, Croydon Council and Tandridge District Council.
Access.
There is access from Riddlesdown Road and Godstone Road.

Oxford Centre for Ecclesiology and Practical Theology

The Oxford Centre for Ecclesiology and Practical Theology (OxCEPT) is a research centre based at Ripon College Cuddesdon. It was founded in May 2006 by the Principal, Martyn Percy as a research-led and consultancy body to work with the church, developing ecclesiology and practical theology that enables the church to develop its polity and praxis for mission and ministry. The Centre initially worked though appointing Research Fellows who were funded by external grants. Initial funded research projects included a detailed ethnographic survey of a midlands diocese in the Church of England, exploring the dynamics of mission and ministry; and a fully funded evaluation of the ‘Fresh Expressions’ movement.
The Centre’s first full-time Director was Dr Helen Cameron, appointed in 2007. The post was generously funded by a supporter and benefactor, who shared the vision of the Centre. Dr Cameron subsequently shaped the Centre as a focussed and dedicated research and consultancy body that sought to ‘think with the church’. The Centre now has a vision for developing the life and mission of the church by attending to God’s work in the world in order to develop faithful and reflective practice. People connect with the Centre to collaborate and engage in strategic thinking, to develop resources, to do research – all with the aim of transforming practice.
Dr Cameron was succeeded as Director by the Rt. Revd. Professor Stephen Pickard (interim Director, 2011). The current Director is the renowned missiologist, Dr Cathy Ross, originally from New Zealand. The Patrons of OxCEPT are The Rt. Revd John Pritchard, Bishop of Oxford and Dr Paula Gooder.
Since its foundation in 2006, OxCEPT has generated over half a million pounds (GB) for research-led and consultancy-based initiatives with the churches, making it one of the most successful and high-profile bodies of its kind in theological education in the UK. OxCEPT’s approach is through praxis-based research, offering consultancy and producing publications. It helps people to network by bringing together parishes, dioceses, mission agencies and other faith based organisations. It is intentionally ecumenical. The work is praxis-orientated as well as independent and constructively critical. In addition to the specific research at the local and national level, OxCEPT is thoroughly embedded in the wider research culture of Ripon College Cuddesdon, where there is a particular expertise in mission, ecclesiology, ecumenism, Anglicanism, and Biblical hermeneutics. 
Notable work undertaken by OxCEPT has included several research projects, including the report on Fresh Expressions commissioned by the Church Urban Fund which particularly focused on emerging forms of church in deprived communities. ARCS (Action Research in Church and Society) was jointly pioneered by OxCEPT and Heythrop College (university of London), one outcome of which was the ‘Living Church in the Global City’ report which investigated the mission outreach of the church and church-related groups. ‘Sustaining Leaders in Mission and Change’ was a significant report into the ministry and resourcing of Archdeacons in the Church of England. There has also been significant research into the spirituality of older people. OxCEPT also has a specialist interest in researching and resourcing chaplaincy practice, in all its manifestations, as well as highlighting its role in the church today. It also has a specialist interest in world Christianity and its significance for the church today.
There are several strands to OxCEPT’s work besides the research that serves both the contemporary church and the academic sphere. It also aims to foster a vibrant learning and research community among the students at Ripon College Cuddesdon during their time in training and beyond. 
Consultancy work is also undertaken for churches, denominations, dioceses and mission agencies. This is usually a process by which a range of experts and some skilled researchers assist an individual, group or organisation to analyse and reflect upon their work. OxCEPT provides consultancy services and support to enable the church to reflect on practice. 
OxCEPT also helps with the professional development and continuing ministerial development of clergy, by fostering research capacity through offering sabbaticals, seminars and educational events. OxCEPT hosts regular public seminars at Ripon College Cuddesdon on issues of interest to students in training and the wider church. Theological Reflection (TR) is at the core of all OxCEPT’s research methods. This comprises a range of methods for investigating and supporting groups as they articulate their espoused theology, and compare it with their operant theology. This is currently being developed under the name of Theological Action Research (TAR).

Raphael Simon Spiegel (born 19 December 1992) is a Swiss professional footballer currently playing for West Ham United.
Club career.
Spiegel began his early career with hometown club FC Rüttenen before being snapped up by Swiss Super League-side Grasshopper Club of Zürich in August 2007. At Grasshopper he rose through the youth ranks at the club, soon playing regularly for the reserves. He was unable to establish himself in their first team and was sent out on a short loan to FC Wil early in the 2011–2012 season though he did not make an appearance for the team. Spiegel returned to Grasshopper only to be sent on loan again, this time to SC Brühl for the rest of the season. He made his debut for Brühl on 6 November 2011 against FC Locarno in a 2–1 away loss. After a successful run in the first team during his loan at Brühl, Spiegel returned to Grasshopper and was transferred on 23 July 2012 to West Ham United after their return to the English Premier League for an undisclosed fee.
Since joining West Ham United, Spiegel has featured in games for the Under-21 squad and is also the club's reserve goalkeeper, working as an understudy to Jussi Jääskeläinen and Adrián San Miguel del Castillo.
International career.
Spiegel is currently a Switzerland youth international. In 2009 he was part of the Swiss under-17 team that won the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup beating the host nation Nigeria 1—0 in the final. He remained an unused substitute throughout the tournament though, unable to displace Swiss first choice Benjamin Siegrist who would go on to win the Golden Glove.

Jan Romuald Byzewski

Jan Romuald Byzewski, better known in America as Father Romuald Byzewski, was born in the Kaszubian village of Karwia, in the Prussian jurisdiction of Danzig (Gdansk), on Oct. 10, 1842. After graduating from secondary school in Wejherowo he entered the Franciscan Recollect Province as a novice on Feb. 7, 1861. Since this was the feast of Saint Romuald. he added the name Romuald to his own. He was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood at Liège, Belgium, on Aug. 5, 1866. After his ordination, Reverend Byzewski became professor of philosophy and theology at the Franciscan seminary in Łąki Bratiańskie, Poland. In 1875, at the height of the Kulturkampf, the Congregations Law was enacted, effectively forbidding Roman Catholic religious orders to operate within the Prussian Empire. Reverend Byzewski was consequently permitted to leave the Franciscans and emigrate to the United States, thereby becoming part of the Kaszubian diaspora.
Reverend Byzewski arrived in New York on August 13, 1875, aboard the SS Mosel. His first service in America was as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish in Winona, Minnesota. He served in this role until 1890. He established a school for the parish, brought in the School Sisters of Notre Dame to teach there, and served as a capable intermediary between the English-speaking majority and the bumptious Kaszubian Poles. As a stalwart supporter of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America he also established the newspaper Wiarus, which quickly became the United States’s leading Polish-language periodical, under the editorship of the mercurial Kaszubian poet Hieronim Derdowski. According to the historian-priest Reverend Waclaw Kruszka, unexplained “disagreements and difficulties” may have sped Father Byzewski’s departure from Winona.
An 1890 city directory for Milwaukee, Wisconsin lists Reverend Byzewski as an assistant pastor at Saint Stanislaus Church at 404 Mitchell Street. Yet by June 1890, he was in Detroit, Michigan directing the foundation of that city's fifth Polish parish, Saint Francis of Assisi. In 1898 he was transferred to Sweetest Heart of Mary Roman Catholic Church, also in Detroit. In 1899, Reverend Byzewski was granted readmission to the Franciscan Order, and relocated to Pulaski, Wisconsin. There he pastored parishes and served as the first rector of Saint Bonaventure College. 
Reverend Jan Romuald Byzewski died in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on October 30, 1905. His grave is at Franciscan Fathers Cemetery in Pittsville, Wisconsin.

Rwanda Film Festival

The Rwanda Film Festival is a film festival held annually in July in Kigali, Rwanda. The Rwanda Film Festival gained worldwide recognition over the past years and has become one of Africa's major film events.
History.
The Rwanda Film Festival was founded in 2005 by Eric Kabera. Presented by the Rwanda Cinema Center, an organization that aims to promote the country's film industry, the Rwanda Film Festival, nicknamed "Hillywood" due to Rwanda's nickname of "Land of a Thousand Hills", is a travelling festival. Due to Kabera's desire to show the films to as large of an audience as possible, the festival is held not only in the capital of Kigali, but the films, especially ones made by Rwandan film-makers, are also shown on large inflatable screens in rural areas throughout the country. More recently, Kabera has stated that the festival will make a move away from focusing only on the issue of the genocide; rather "other social issues" of modern Rwanda will be explored.
Silverback Awards.
The Silverback Awards were launched after the Silverback Sponsorship from London firm Hard Media with the Rwanda Film Festival.

Cerastoderma glaucum

Cerastoderma glaucum, commonly known as the lagoon cockle, is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Cardiidae, the cockles.
This species is found along the coasts of Europe and North Africa, including the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Caspian Lake, and the low-salinity Baltic Sea. It is a euryhaline species living in salinities 4-100 ‰. In north-west Europe (including the British Isles), it typically does not live on open shores but rather in shallow burrows in saline lagoons, or sometimes on lower shores in estuaries. It cannot tolerate significant exposure to the air. The form found in lagoons is thinner-shelled than the estuarine populations.
The lagoon cockle can grow to the length of 50 mm. In north-west Europe, it spawns in May-July, and the planktonic larval phase takes 11-30 days. The life span of the settled cockle is typically 2-5 years.
The species was described as "Cardium glaucum" in 1789 almost simultaneously both by Bruguière and by Poiret.

2012 Vintage Yachting Games – Europe Male

The Europe Male was an event on the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games program at Lake Como, Italy. Five out of the nine scheduled race were completed. 11 sailors, on 11 boats, from 5 nations entered. The event was started together with the Europe Female event. However separate scores were given.
Venue overview.
Race area and Course.
Of the three Campo's (Race Area's) available for the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games at Lake Como Campo Bravo was used for the Europe Male event. In general this Campo is situated in front of the city of Dervio.
For the 2012 edition of the Vintage Yachting Games three different courses were available. The Europe Male could only use course 3.
Wind conditions.
The Northern part of Lake Como was reportedly a thermic wind venue. In this time of year the normal situation is that at about 13:00 the Swiss mountains are heated up and a Southern wind hits the racing areas with about 10 to 14 knots. As result of this no races were scheduled in the morning. Unfortunately during the event the temperature in Switzerland was low during the Vintage. Also was the thermal South breeze battling with the gradient wind from the North. As result the actual wind did not came above the 8 knots during the races and was instable at times.
Campo Bravo has normally a tendency to have a slightly higher wind speed than the two other Campo's this due to the fact that it is more Northern than Charlie so that the Southern thermal breeze is strengthened and that the fact that the lake narrows in front of Dervio.

Races.
Summary.
In the Europe Male at Campo Bravo only five races could be completed.
In the Europe class, Olympic from 1992 – 2004, the female and male event started as one fleet in this Vintage. Of cause they had separate results.
By the male Europe sailors Frederik RASK and Sverre REINKE both had 11.7 points after five races. Frederik took the gold after breaking the tie. Bronze was for Jacob CHOLEWA, Denmark.

Survarium

Survarium is a free-to-play online first-person shooter with role-playing and survival elements developed by Vostok Games through a venture capital following the purported cancellation of "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2" and closure of GSC Game World in December 2011. Although "Survarium" is external to the "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." series, the developers intend to include comparable features, notably the anomalies and artifacts that reference the Russian science-fiction novel "Roadside Picnic", and the 'ecological catastrophe' that renders much of the environment uninhabitable for humans.
On 9 December 2011, video game journalists reported that Sergei Grigorovich, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GSC Game World, had allegedly expressed his disappointment at the development of "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2" during a meeting with employees. Despite the company's initial denials in response to press inquiries, the media widely reported that senior management had officially cancelled "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2" and dissolved the company. In March 2012, former employees from GSC Game World founded Vostok Games with capital from Vostok Ventures Ltd, and announced subsequently the development of "Survarium" on 25 April 2012.
Alpha test.
On 13 May 2013, the alpha test started in Russia. The alpha launched internationally a few weeks later.
Beta test.
The closed beta testing is currently in progress for the PvP mode although it does not even have 50% of the planned content implemented. Every minute, a user on the official Survarium website is chosen to participate in the beta test.
MMOFPS Status.
At this point in development and for the foreseeable future, Survarium is not an MMOFPS despite Vostok Games listing it as such on the games website. According to Vostok Games their "ultimate goal is to eventually combine the entire world of Survarium into one massive game world" but no mention has been made of increasing the number of players allowed to interact simultaneously in the game world to achieve the status of being a true MMOFPS.

Giuseppe Besozzi (born 1686 in Milan – d. 2 December 1760 in Naples) was an Italian oboist. In the eighteenth century the Besozzi family produced several important oboists who worked in Turin, Naples, London, Paris and Dresden. Giuseppe's brothers Alessandro Besozzi and Paolo Girolamo Besozzi lived in Turin, and his sons Antonio Besozzi in Naples and Gaetano Besozzi in Paris and London. Antonio Besozzi's son Carlo Besozzi worked in Dresden and Gaetano's son Girolamo Besozzi, the grandfather of the composer Louis Désiré Besozzi, worked in Paris.

Altesse Royale

Altesse Royale (foaled 1968) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. In a brief racing career, lasting from October 1970 until September 1971 she ran five times and won four races. In 1971 she won the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom and the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. Altesse Royale was injured and retired from racing later that year. She made no impact as a broodmare.
Background.
Altesse Royal was tall, lightly-built chestnut filly with a narrow white blaze and white socks on her hind feet. She was bred by Vera Hue-Williams and raced in the colours of her husband Roger Hue-Williams. She was sired by Saint Crespin, a half-brother of Tulyar, who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1959. Her dam, Bleu Azur won two minor races and was a half-sister to the Champion Hurdler Magic Court. Bleu Azur had previously produced the Fred Darling Stakes winner Royal Saint. As a descendant of the broodmare Rose Red, Altesse Royale was a product of the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 1-w which produced Alycidon, Festoon, Celtic Ash and Larkspur.
Altesse Royale was sent into training with Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk.
Racing career.
Altesse Royale was slow to mature, and Murless ran her only once. In October she won a maiden race over six furlongs at Lingfield Park.
On her three-year-old debut, Altesse Royale was moved up to Group Three class for the Nell Gwyn Stakes, a recognised trial race for the 1000 Guineas run over seven furlongs at Newmarket. She finished second to Super Honey, carrying four pounds less than the winner. She was not regarded as a leading contender for the Classic at Newmarket, and Murless's stable jockey, Geoff Lewis, elected to ride the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Magic Flute. Ridden by the leading French jockey Yves Saint-Martin, Altesse Royale started at 25/1 in a field of ten fillies. She took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by one and a half lengths from Super Honey with Catherine Wheel third and Magic Flute fourth. Her win gave Murless a fifth success in the race, setting a 20th-century record.
Geoff Lewis reclaimed the ride on Altesse Royale when she ran in the Epsom Oaks a month later. She started 6/4 favourite despite some doubts about her stamina: her sister Royal Saint had apparently failed to stay one and a half miles when she was the beaten favourite for the race in 1967. Lewis sent Altesse Royale past her stable companion Maina to take the lead in the straight and the filly drew clear to win by three lengths. the win gave Lewis a notable double, as he had won the Derby on Mill Reef three days earlier. In July she was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. She won, but was not impressive in beating the French-trained filly Vincennes by half a length.
Altesse Royale was being prepared for a run in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp in September when she sustained an injury in training and was retired to stud.
Retirement.
Altesse Royale was retired to her owners' Rathasker Stud in County Kildare, Ireland. She was bred to stallions including Mill Reef, Brigadier Gerard, Dancer's Image and Known Fact, but produced no winners of note.
Assessment and honours.
Altesse Royale was given a rating of 126 by Timeform.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Altesse Royale an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks.
Pedigree.
Altesse Royale was inbred 3x4 to Donatello, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

Orme (horse)

Orme (1889 – 17 September 1915) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He was trained at Kingsclere by John Porter for the 1st Duke of Westminster. As a two-year-old he won the Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes. As a three-year-old he was not well enough to take part in the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby, but came back to win the Eclipse Stakes. Orme stayed in training as a four-year-old and won another Eclipse Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the race twice, a feat that has only been repeated four times since. After he had retired from racing, he became a successful sire and was Champion sire of Great Britain in 1899. His son Flying Fox won the Triple Crown and the Eclipse Stakes. Orme also sired Epsom Derby winner Orby and 1000 Guineas winner Witch Elm. His regular jockeys were George Barrett and Morny Cannon.
Background.
Orme was a bay colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands high and had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's first crop of foals. By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been exported to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few foals most years. However, he did also sire Goldfinch who was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.
Orme's dam Angelica was an unraced sister to the outstanding sire St. Simon. They were progeny of Galopin and St. Angela, a daughter of King Tom. The Duke of Westminster had purchased Angelica in 1886 when she was carrying a foal by Coeruleus. The foal was Blue Green, who went on to win the Queen Alexandra Stakes. Orme was Angelica's fifth foal.
Orme showed great promise as a yearling, with trainer John Porter saying he had great expectations for him after only having him for a few months. In October 1890 Orme and Orville were described as "he two finest yearlings in the Duke of Westminster's stud."
Racing career.
1891: Two-year-old season.
Prior to Orme's first appearance on a racecourse, John Porter tested him over five furlongs against the three-year-old Massacre and three two-year-olds, including Orville. Ridden by George Barrett, Orme won the trial by half a length from Massacre.
Early career.
Orme started his racing career in August 1891 at the Glorious Goodwood meeting at Goodwood Racecourse. He was ridden by George Barrett and started the 4/5 favourite in the Richmond Stakes. 20/1 outsider Ben Avon led the field of eight in the early stages of the race, with Orme in the middle of the pack. Orme took the lead with a quarter of a mile left to run, and despite showing his inexperience, he won easily by three quarters of a length from Flyaway (who was carrying more weight than Orme), the two then colliding as they pulled up. At the same meeting, two days later, Orme also started in the Prince of Wales' Stakes. He started as the 1/2 favourite and led the field from the start. Dunure made some progress from the back of the field into second place, but none of the runners could get to Orme, who won by one length. Dunure was second and Galeopsis was third, four lengths behind Dunure. After these two races, he was already as short as 5/1 for the 1892 Epsom Derby. After Goodwood the Duke of Westminster refused a big offer to purchase Orme. 
Orme then took on older horses in the valuable Lancashire Plate, where he started the 7/4 favourite. In the last few furlongs Orme challenged the four-year-old Signorina for the lead, and as they approached the main stand, Martagon challenged the pair. Orme drew level with Signorina, but the filly edged away slightly again and won an exciting race by half a length from Orme, Martagon a head back in third. Orme received £1000 for finishing second.
October.
He returned to racing against horses of his own age, starting the 8/15 favourite of a field of ten runners for the six-furlong Middle Park Plate at Newmarket. As the field neared the finish, Orme was travelling the best, and as soon as Barrett let him go, he immediately took the lead. El Diablo tried to close, but could not get to Orme, with the latter winning easily by a couple of lengths, Gantlet being a neck back from El Diablo in third. Orme then started in the Dewhurst Plate, but his presence deterred many owners from entering and he faced only two rivals. He started as the 6/100 favourite, with El Diablo at 20/1 and Hatfield at 50/1. Orme led from the start, and with two furlongs to run he began to stride away. El Diablo tried to close, but Orme won by three-quarters of a length from him and was never extended. Hatfield finished well behind Orme and El Diablo in third place. Orme's final race of the season came on 30 October in the Home-bred Foal Post Stakes over five furlongs and 140 yards at Newmarket. He started as the 3/100 favourite and faced three rivals. Orme lead throughout the race and won easily by two lengths from Esmond, with Lucellum a further three lengths back in third place.
He finished his two-year-old season with a record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that he was better than his sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more cautious, however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.
1892: Three-year-old season.
Going into the 1892 season Orme was a strong favourite for the Epsom Derby, with odds as short as 2/1 in December. In March he was still favourite, but had drifted out slightly to 5/2 due to the support for stablemate La Fleche.
Suspected poisoning.
In late April there were reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was withdrawn from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still be able to make the Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.
By mid-May it was clear that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the veterinary surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.
Summer return.
Porter ran Orme in a trial four days before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old half-brother Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden in the middle of the field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.
St. Leger Stakes.
Orme had apparently improved significantly since Goodwood, and jockey George Barrett said, "I would stake my life he can beat Watercress 100 yards. I never was on such a horse in my life." Orme's previous wins made him favourite for the race, starting at 10/11, with 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks winner La Fleche second favourite at 7/2. Also near the front of the betting were Derby winner Sir Hugo at 10/1 and May Duke at 100/7.
In the race the early pace was slow, and Barrett positioned Orme near the front of the field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme was just leading from La Fleche, but Barrett soon picked up the whip and it was clear Orme was beaten. La Fleche went on to win easily by two lengths from Sir Hugo, with Watercress a further three lengths back in third, May Duke in fourth and Orme in fifth. The remainder of the field, led by The Lover, were at least twenty lengths behind Orme. After the race Barrett said: "I never was so disappointed in my life. He never took hold of his bit as he used to do; run as dead as a stone, and wouldn't make an effort." Other jockeys in the race agreed, saying Orme was "sulking" throughout the race. After the race, some suggested that Orme simply did not stay, the St Leger distance being too far for him.
Autumn.
Orme next raced in the Great Foal Stakes at Newmarket. He won easily by 1½ lengths from Versailles, with Dunure in third place. He then faced only one rival in the Champion Stakes, Orvieto, whom he defeated in the Eclipse. Orme started the 1/3 favourite and made the running, leading by a length with two furlongs to run. Barrett then asked Orme to quicken, and Orvieto could not keep up, with Orme going on to win by a couple of lengths. 
Two weeks later he faced Sir Hugo, Orvieto, El Diablo and Frank Marsh in the Limekiln Stakes at the Newmarket Houghton meeting. Orme started the 4/5 favourite, and with two furlongs to run he strode into the lead. Without even being asked for an effort, he won easily by three lengths from El Diablo, with Sir Hugo in third. The next day he won the Subscription Stakes easily from Porridge, after leading from the start and never being caught. He raced again the next day, his third race in as many days, in a Free Handicap Sweepstakes over ten furlongs where he faced five opponents. Orme started as the 4/6 favourite, Bushey Park was at 5/1. Next in the betting came El Diablo, The Lover and Therapia all priced at 100/12. Bushey Park led in the early stages until Orme went into the lead with about two furlongs left to run. El Diablo overtook Orme in the final 100 yards and beat him by one and a half lengths. The Lover finished in third place, three quarters of a length behind Orme. Orme had to carry 16 pounds more weight than El Diablo and 22 pounds more than The Lover.
1893: Four-year-old season.
Orme returned to the track as a four-year-old in the Rous Memorial Stakes at Royal Ascot. His only opposition was the four-year-old filly Lady Lena. Lady Lena briefly challenged Orme in the closing stages, but new jockey Morny Cannon only had to shake the reins a couple of times and Orme went away to win easily by a couple of lengths. He then went back to Sandown to attempt to win another Eclipse Stakes. He started the 2/1 second favourite, with the evens favourite being La Fleche who beat him in the St Leger. La Fleche was being hard ridden a long way from the finish. Soon after Orme took over the lead, but began to hang left. In the final furlong Medicis passed La Fleche and began to challenge Orme, but could not get on terms and Orme won by half a length, with La Fleche a further three lengths back in third.
Orme and La Fleche met again in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble with more than a quarter of a mile still to run. He seemed to have the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and allowing La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.

Assessment.
At the end of 1891 he was considered by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche. By the time he retired at the end of the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme was at his best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than he had been at two and three.
Stud record.
Orme was retired to stud at the end of his four-year-old season, and on 26 October 1893 he left Newmarket for Eaton Stud. His first covering was St. Mary, a daughter of Hermit, which resulted in his first foal (a chestnut colt) being born in January 1895. His stud fee for 1898 was 200 guineas, plus one guinea for the groom. Orme became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899, with more than double the winnings of any other sire that year, largely thanks to his son Flying Fox. His son Duke of Westminster was sold for £20,050 as a two-year-old. His fee was still 200 guineas in 1902. In total Orme sired 242 winners of races worth a total of £122,568.
Notable progeny.
"s = stallion, m = mare, g = gelding"
Flying Fox went on to be champion sire in France three times. His progeny included Prix du Jockey Club and Grand Prix de Paris winner Ajax, Prix de Diane winner Flying Star, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Cadran winner Gouvernant, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Jockey Club winner Dagor, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Eclipse Stakes winner Val d'Or and Prix de la Forêt winner Adam.
Orby went on to sire Epsom Derby and St. James's Palace Stakes winner Grand Parade and 1000 Guineas winner Diadem. Orme's son Missel Thrush sired July Cup winner Thrush. Orme's daughter Topiary was the dam of the St Leger and Eclipse winner Tracery. Orme's daughter Optime was the dam of the American horse Sysonby, who was only defeated once in his career. Another daughter Osella was the dam of Grosser Preis von Baden winner Ossian and Preis der Diana winner Ostrea.
Orme was pensioned from stud duty in 1912. He died at Eaton Stud on 17 September 1915 aged 26 and was buried near his grandsire Bend Or. Orme's sire line continues today mainly through Ajax's son Teddy.
