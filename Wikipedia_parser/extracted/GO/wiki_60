Cornelia Schlosser

Cornelia Friederica Christiana Schlosser (née Goethe; 7 December 1750 – 8 June 1777) was the sister and only sibling of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who survived to adulthood.
Life.
Cornelia Goethe, 15 months younger than her brother Johann Wolfgang, was born in Frankfurt am Main. Her father, imperial councillor Johann Caspar Goethe (29 July 171025 May1782), thought it appropriate for an upper-class woman to have some higher education, and Cornelia was educated together with her brother, which was unusual in those days. At the age of three, she was sent to a kindergarten school, where she learnt reading and writing with Magdalena Hoff. From the age of seven, she and her brother were taught together by a tutor. Latin and ancient Greek were the first languages she was taught, and two years later, she also began receiving French lessons. She also learnt English, Italian, law, geography, mathematics, and calligraphy, as well as singing, piano, and drawing. She also learnt fencing and horseriding, and received lessons in dance and etiquette. In her leisure time, she pursued literary interests, which she discussed with her brother.
Cornelia did not fit into the relaxed environment of that time due to her serious and hypochondriac nature. She did not relate well to her parents, as there were significant differences between her personality and that of her mother Katharina Elisabeth Goethe (1731 - 1808), who was known as the cheerful "Frau Rat" (""Lady Councillor""), and as she did not forgive her father for having overburdened her with studies and thus having robbed her of some joys of childhood. She could relate better to her brother, who understood her and did not ignore her interest in intellectual pursuits. She had a good relationship with Johann Wolfgang and turned out to be a source of love, comfort, and support for him when he was plagued by fears and self-reproach after his relationship with his girlfriend "Gretchen" ended. Goethe's relationship with "Gretchen" had led him to move in circles that were involved in somewhat criminal activities. These circumstances laid the foundations for a deep friendship between Cornelia and Johann Wolfgang. Of all relationships in her life, Cornelia's relationship with her brother was the closest and a source of great happiness for her.
Cornelia was not conventionally beautiful, but her brother admired her deep and intelligent eyes. Her circle of friends consisted of pretty, but rather superficial women who were enjoying the exuberance of youth and willingly included Cornelia in their circle as they did not fear her as a rival.
When Johann Wolfgang went to Leipzig to study law, Cornelia stayed at home in Frankfurt. Johann Wolfgang's three years in Leipzig interrupted the siblings' daily contact for the first time. Cornelia observed that her brother adopted the prevalent attitude of the time toward women, that is, one in which women were considered subordinate to men. She took great interest in her brother's literary accomplishments and was often the first to know about his plans, drafts, and revisions. Letters from this time that she wrote to her friend Katharina Fabricius in French have been preserved. Cornelia suffered the disadvantages of being a woman at that time, but did not see an alternative to marriage: "Es ist offensichtlich, daß ich nicht immer Mädchen bleiben kann, überdies wäre es sehr lächerlich, sich das vorzunehmen." ("It is obvious that I cannot stay a girl all my life, and planning to do so would be ridiculous."). She married Johann Georg Schlosser, a jurist, and had two daughters, Maria Anne Louise and Catharina Elisabeth Julie.
She died in Emmendingen at the age of 26.
Legacy.
The Cornelia Goethe Center for Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Frankfurt is named after her, as is the Cornelia Goethe Prize that it awards.

Grenfell fossil site

The Grenfell fossil site is a paleontological site of late Devonian age in the central west of New South Wales, Australia. It was discovered in the late 1970s and lies near the town of Grenfell, some 370 km west of Sydney, and has been the subject of ongoing investigations by the Australian Museum.
The Grenfell site is important as the youngest locality for Devonian fossils in New South Wales, containing a diverse range of placoderm, acanthodian and sarcopterygian fishes. The fossils are found in the Hunter Siltstone formation, of which there are extensive outcrops in the hills around Grenfell. The fish are mainly disarticulated but not extensively damaged, indicating transport after death by running water for a short distance.
Fossil fauna.
Sarcopterygians found include "Eusthenodon gavini", "Mandageria fairfaxi", "Cabonnichthys burnsi", "Yarimba thomsoni", "Grenfellia meemanae" and "Holoptychius" sp. The placoderm genera "Bothriolepis", "Remigolepis", "Groenlandaspis" and "Grenfellaspis" are also present.

Eon was a distributed computing project for the BOINC client, which uses theoretical chemistry techniques to solve problems in condensed matter physics and materials science. It was a project of the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas.
Traditional molecular dynamics can accurately model events that occur within a fraction of a millisecond. In order to model events that take place on much longer timescales, Eon combines transition state theory with kinetic Monte Carlo. The result is a combination of classical mechanics and quantum methods like density functional theory.

New Highland Park

New Highland Park is a small 0.41 acre park at the northeast corner of North Highland Avenue and St. Charles Place in the historic Atkins Park neighborhood of Atlanta, often considered a part of the larger Virginia Highland neighborhood.
The park was originally the site of two adjacent lots, 1076 and 1082 St. Charles Place. 1082 was a house. In 1952 the house was demolished and the Highland Branch of the Atlanta Public Library was built on the two lots. The library was enlarged in 1976 and demolished in 1990. In December 2008 the Virginia Highland Civic Association bought the land.
The park is undeveloped as of March 2011. However there are plans to develop it into an eco-friendly park and rain garden. The project is planned to function as a demonstration project for managing storm water through bioretention. Bioretention involves capturing the water on site with the help of native Georgia plants, which naturally remove pollutants from water. The water goes back into the water table instead of into storm drains and being lost.

<doc id="31117956" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31117956" title="A. T. Hill">
A. T. Hill

Asa Thomas Hill (November 29, 1871–March 21, 1953), generally known as A. T. Hill, was an American businessman and archaeologist. His work on sites in and around Nebraska, with such collaborators as William Duncan Strong and Waldo Wedel, was instrumental in the development of Great Plains archaeology.
Early life and career.
Hill was born in 1871 in Cisne, Illinois, the oldest of six children of David D. Hill and Angenora Leak Hill. In about 1875, the family moved to Logan in Phillips County, Kansas. After a brief return to Illinois, they settled permanently on a homestead in Phillips County in 1878.
Hill grew up in a sod house. As a child, he was hidden in a straw stack by his mother during the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. On the frontier, schools and teachers were few, and the responsibilities of an oldest son on a dryland farm were many; Hill's formal education ended in the fourth grade.
At the age of 18, Hill left home to ride the rails throughout the western United States. As he travelled, he worked a variety of odd jobs: dishwasher in a mining camp, photographer, portrait painter, and market hunter. In jumping from a moving freight train, he severely injured an ankle; the injury troubled him for the rest of his life.
Hill returned to Logan, where he and his father opened a general store. He married Mayme Rouse of Plainville, Kansas.
Hill and the Pike site.
In 1806, a party led by Zebulon Pike had visited a Pawnee village on the Republican River shortly after the departure of a much larger Spanish expedition. At the village, Pike had persuaded the Pawnee chief to lower a Spanish flag and to raise that of the United States.
The site of the Pike flag incident was thought to be the Pawnee Indian Village Site near Republic, Kansas. In 1901, the state of Kansas erected a monument on the site; in 1906, a four-day celebration was held to commemorate the centennial of the occurrence.
Hill was one of those who attended the 1906 celebration. Intrigued, he read Pike's journal and the publications of the Kansas and Nebraska historical societies concerning Pike's expedition. From Pike's account of his route, and from a study of the topography of the area, he concluded that the Kansas monument was at the wrong site, and that the Pike flag event must have taken place somewhere in the vicinity of present-day Red Cloud, Nebraska.
The Hills' general store failed, and Hill had to seek work elsewhere. He was hired by an automobile dealer in Fairbury, Nebraska, where he and his family moved in about 1910. When that dealer went out of business in 1912, Hill moved to Hastings, Nebraska, where he went to work selling cars for the A. H. Jones Company; later, he became the company's wholesale manager. His work took him throughout the area in which he thought that the missing Pawnee village must be located, and he took advantage of his business travel to search for artifacts and to query local residents for clues as to its location.
In 1923, he learned of a site near Guide Rock in Webster County, Nebraska, at which Spanish artifacts had been discovered. The owner, the son of the original homesteader, told him that when the ground was first plowed, it was covered with Native American artifacts. Over the next year and a half, Hill excavated at the site, discovering additional Spanish material and other evidence that there had been an important Pawnee village there. He also compared the local topography to Pike's account, and attempted to follow Pike's route to and from the site. All of this persuaded him that he had found the true village that Pike had visited.
In 1925, in order to protect the site and to make it available for archaeological investigation, Hill bought the two farms that covered it, totalling . Through 1930, he continued his investigations at the site. Today, there is a strong consensus among archaeologists that Hill correctly identified the Pike village.
Strong and Wedel.
In 1929, William Duncan Strong joined the University of Nebraska faculty as a professor of anthropology. In the following year, he began fieldwork along the Republican River in southern Nebraska, assisted by graduate student Waldo Wedel. Hill made contact with the party and, once he was convinced that they were serious students of the past and not mere relic-hunters, invited them to his property in Webster County. Strong's University of Nebraska Archaeological Survey spent two weeks excavating at the site; after the excavation was done, Wedel continued to study the artifacts that they had recovered. This was the first application of Strong's direct historical approach to Central Plains archaeology; in 1936, Wedel published his 1930 master's thesis as the seminal "An Introduction to Pawnee Archeology".
Hill did not limit his investigations to the Pike village. In the course of searching for it, he had discovered archaeological sites throughout much of Nebraska and Kansas; and he continued to seek new sites as he travelled through the area. To augment his own efforts, he recruited his salesmen to scout for him. Although he did not give them their present names, he recognized the existence of distinct indigenous cultures in the region: the Woodland, Upper Republican, Lower Loup, and Pawnee complexes.
In the mid-1930s, Hill, Wedel, and Strong found archaeological evidence in Nebraska of a previously unknown prehistoric culture, different from the Central Plains and Woodland traditions. The new culture was named the Dismal River culture, or Dismal River aspect, for its location in the Dismal River basin of Nebraska. It is dated between 1650-1750 A.D.
Nebraska State Historical Society.
In 1933, Hill retired from the automobile dealership and moved from Hastings to Lincoln. In that year, the Nebraska State Historical Society named him Director of the Museum and Field Archeology.
Hill proved a great asset to the Society. At a time when the Great Depression had forced deep budget cuts, he was able to work without a salary and to finance excavations out of his own pocket. With his managerial ability and business acumen, he was able to secure federal funds to hire archaeological crews of unemployed persons, and to organize and direct the crews efficiently in the field. From 1933 until 1941, when the United States' entry into World War II put a halt to it, he oversaw extensive excavation projects in Nebraska and Kansas.
During the war, Hill concentrated on the museum, and on the study of material collected in previous years. He managed the conversion of the museum from a library and research institution to one with popular appeal, and contributed his "unsurpassed" collection of Pawnee artifacts to it.
With the conclusion of the war, Hill was eager to return to field work. In 1947, he led a NSHS crew to Frontier County, Nebraska, where sites in the basin of Medicine Creek were threatened by the construction of the Medicine Creek Reservoir. However, failing health forced him to retire in 1949.
Hill died in Los Angeles in 1953.
Recognition.
According to Wedel, Hill had an "aversion to setting down in print what he had seen or inferred", which kept his contributions to the field from being recognized by the larger archaeological community.
The Pike-Pawnee Village Site, where Pike's flag incident took place, is also known as the Hill Farm Site.
In 1948, the University of Nebraska gave Hill its "Nebraska Builder" award, citing him as the "father of systematic archeology in Nebraska".
In 1975, the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation established its Asa T. Hill Award for notable archaeological work in Nebraska or the Great Plains. Recipients have included professional and amateur archaeologists.

Fred Rehor

Frederick Lee "Fritz" Rehor (December 15, 1893 – July 19, 1959) was an American football player. He played college football for Fielding H. Yost's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1914 to 1916. He also played professional football and was a member of the 1917 professional football champion Massillon Tigers, coached by Knute Rockne. He later operated a drug store in Canton, Ohio.
Early years.
Rehor was born in Hastings, Michigan in 1893. His parents, Jacob and Louisa Rehor, emigrated to the United States from Germany. His father operated a buzz planer in a table factory.
University of Michigan.
Rehor attended the University of Michigan as a pharmacy student. He graduated in 1917. While attending Michigan, he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and played guard for Fielding H. Yost's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1914 to 1916. Following a November 1916 game against Penn, "The New York Times" wrote: "The work of Rehor on the line ranked the best ever seen in Michigan. The husky 250-pounder outplayed Henning from start to finish, and broke through and nailed the backs for losses." In a summary of the 1916 season, "The Michigan Alumnus" wrote: "Of the linemen, Rehor was always prominent, breaking up numerous plays and showing an excellent nose for the ball. Many a spectator will long retain the mental image of the big guard catching a short kick-off and ploughing down the field with the ball."
Professional football.
After graduating from Michigan, Rehor played professional football. In October 1917, he joined the Massillon Tigers. When it was announced that Rehor would join the Tigers, "The Evening Independent" in Massillon ran a feature story on Rehor, billing him as the "Newest Tiger Giant." The article noted:"Rehor, who graduated from Michigan last spring, tips the beam at 255 pounds. He stands nearly six feet tall and was one of the big men on the Michigan eleven for three seasons. The Michigan giant will arrive here early Saturday morning. He comes here backed by a reputation of being one of the best linemen who played college foot ball in 1916. He should be a tower of strength to the Tiger line, especially when the big battles with Akron, Canton and Youngstown are staged."
Rehor started at right guard in Massillon's 14–6 victory over Buffalo. After the game, "The Evening Independent" wrote: "Rehor with his 256 odd pounds bowled over the visiting linemen and formed a defensive bulwark that couldn't be budged." After a 3–0 loss to Akron, the paper noted that the team put up a strong battle on defense with Rehor and Copley (playing at right guard and right tackle) playing "strong defensive games, tackling hard and accurately." In a 28–0 victory over the Columbus Panhandles, Rehor also handled kickoffs. After the game, the Massillon paper wrote: "Exhibiting the same stonewall defense that has characterized their play all season, the Tigers had little trouble in stopping the battering tactics of the Panhandles ... The visitors made four first down but three of them came on forward passes and the other on a penalty. Gains through the Tiger line were few and far between as Nash, Copley, Thornhill, Wesbecher, Rehor and Rambaud were in every mixup and dropped the heavy Panhandle backs in their tracks most of the time." During the fourth quarter of the last game of the regular season, Rehor got into a fight with "Unk" Russell of the Canton Bulldogs, and both were ejected by the referee. The Massillon newspaper reported: "Rehor claimed that Russell had slugged him in scrimmage. Fritz's fighting blood became warm and he wasn't long opening hostilities with the giant Pennsylvanian. Fists flew freely for a few seconds but the mix up was stopped without damage to either player."
The Tigers advanced to play Jim Thorpe's Canton Bulldogs in the 1917 "world's professional football championship" game on December 2, 1917. Prior to the game, the Massillon paper noted that the "former giant Michigan guard" had been "a tower of trength on the Tiger line this season." The Tigers were coached in the championship game by Knute Rockne and defeated the Bulldogs by a score of 6 to 0; Rehor was the starting left guard in the game.
Family and later years.
In April 1918, Rehor married Gertrude E. Ricker of Canton, Ohio. Following a quiet wedding ceremony in Canton, the couple left on a trip to Detroit and Hastings, Michigan. On their return, the couple planned to live in Canton, where Rehor was employed as a chemist at the Central Steel plant.
At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Rehor was living in Canton with his wife Gertrude; he was employed as a chemist in the steel industry. At the time of the 1930 U.S. Census, Rehor was living in Canton with his wife Gertrude (age 38), daughter Marilyn Jean Rehor (age 5) and son Richard Dale Rehor (age 11 months). He was employed as a merchant operating a retail drugstore. In 1941, Rehor was still living in Canton and operating a drug store. Rehor died in Canton in July 1959.

Rex Smith Aeroplane Company

Rex Smith Aeroplane Company was an American aircraft manufacturer in College Park, Maryland.
The founder, Rex Smith, was an inventor and a patent attorney. He placed his offices in Washington D.C., and operations at College Park Airport. The company was capitalized with $500,000 in 1910 with Victor J Evans as president and Rex Smith as Vice president.
In 1911, Rex Smith moved his hangar to line up with the Army Aviation School, and hired Frank Kastory from Anzani, and Abraham Whalomie Raygorodsky from Russia. He test flew Smith aircraft alongside Fox engine powered Curtiss aircraft. Rex also hired Tony Jannus, and Paul Peck as test pilots. In a stroke of coincidence, flying at the same airport at the same time was another military aviator, Paul W. Beck.
The Rex Smith Biplane was used in the successful April 3, 1911 U.S. Army Signal Corps experiments in wireless communications. Potomac river pontoon experiments on April 5, were not as successful, with the aircraft plowing into the water headfirst nearly drowning the test pilot Jannus. Just two days later the machine was ready again. Janus took up actor Nat M. Wills, and later two female passengers at the same time. Marking the first time an aircraft flew with more than one passenger.
The Signal Corps did not buy any Smith Biplanes, they did however use them from time to time to train pilots to fly the Curtiss aircraft at the same field.

Gilbert F. Casellas

Gilbert F. Casellas (b. August 2, 1952) is an American lawyer and businessman. He is Chairman of OMNITRU, a Washington, DC-area investment and consulting firm, a director of Prudential Financial, trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, and advisor to Toyota Motor North America and Comcast Corporation. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the American Law Institute.
Personal and Educational Background.
Gilbert F. Casellas was born and raised in the Ybor City section of Tampa, Florida and attended the segregated St. Peter Claver School until he was twelve years old. He worked his way through Jesuit High School of Tampa. He was awarded a financial scholarship to Yale University in 1970; and received a B.A. in Latin American Studies in 1974. In 1977, he received a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. 
Professional Background.
Early Professional Experience and Community Activities.
Following law school, Casellas served a two-year clerkship with the Honorable A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
From 1980 through 1993, he practiced with the Philadelphia law firm of Montgomery, McCracken, Walker and Rhoads where he specialized in civil litigation. He ultimately served as a member of the Management Committee and as Personnel Partner, overseeing all professional personnel matters for all 165 lawyers, in the entire firm.
In 1984, Casellas was elected National President of the Hispanic National Bar Association, serving as the leader and spokesperson for the thousands of Hispanic American lawyers in the United States. In 1989, he became the president of the University of Pennsylvania Law Alumni Society, representing the interests of the thousands of graduates of the Law School. Locally in Philadelphia, he served as Chair of the Board of Governors of the Philadelphia Bar Association, Chair of its Young Lawyers Section, as well as chair of numerous bar association committees. He also served as a member of the House of Delegates of the American and Pennsylvania Bar Associations and member of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Opportunities for Minorities in the Profession, among others. 
In 1977, he helped to form, and served as outside counsel to, the Latino Project, Inc., a public interest law firm engaged in protecting the rights of Philadelphia’s Latino community. He later served as a board member of the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, Community Legal Services, the Philadelphia Bar Foundation, and the United Way of Southeastern Pennsylvania. 
He was called upon in many other civic and public matters in Philadelphia. He served as a member of the Mayor’s Commission on Puerto Rican/Latino Affairs. During 1990, he was called upon and served on a "pro bono publico" basis as Special Counsel to the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations during its citywide inquiry into concerns of Philadelphia’s Latino community following a summer of unrest arising out of the arrests and treatment of several Latino youths. In 1985, he was appointed by the federal court to serve as a receiver to negotiate and settle fee disputes in three job discrimination class action lawsuits by Latinos against the City of Philadelphia’s Police and Fire Departments. With Court approval, he directed a portion of the proceeds from the successful fee resolution of those class actions to establish a scholarship for Latino law students at the University of Pennsylvania in 2008.
Public Service Experience.
In 1993, Mr. Casellas was appointed by President Bill Clinton and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate as General Counsel of the United States Department of the Air Force. In that capacity, he served as chief legal officer and final legal authority to more than 2,000 military, civilian and reserve attorneys throughout the world. During this period, he also served as the Governor of Wake Island. Among his accomplishments, he provided essential legal support for streamlining acquisition processes to achieve National and Defense Performance Review Objectives and ensured legal authority was available to indemnify the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for contingency operations in Somalia and Haiti. He also served as a member of the Defense Department’s Task Force on Discrimination and Sexual Harassment. For his leadership and superior achievements, he was presented with the Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service. 
In July 1994, President Bill Clinton called upon him to leave the Pentagon and serve as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), an office for which he was confirmed unanimously and in which he served with well-recognized distinction until 1998. As Chairman of the Commission, he served as the chief administrative official for all operations of the Commission, its fifty field offices, its 2700 employees and its annual budget of $250 million. 
As EEOC Chairman, Mr. Casellas led broad changes in the way the Commission does business, including streamlining its case-handling system, expanding the use of alternative dispute resolution, forging a new and productive partnership with nearly 100 state and local fair employment practices agencies, and developing practical policy guidelines on applying the EEO laws to the workplace. For his personal intervention in successfully resolving the EEOC’s historically acrimonious internal labor-management disputes and in transforming the agency into a model of labor-management partnership, the agency received a “Hammer of Reinvention” from Vice President Al Gore. 
In accepting his resignation with regret, President Bill Clinton stated that “you have helped restore Americans’ trust that the EEOC is an agency dedicated to providing prompt and fair enforcement of civil rights laws. In these and in many other ways, you have been an important part of our mission to make America a nation of equal opportunity for all.” 
The changes instituted during his tenure remain largely in place today. His legacy and imprint on the Commission were recognized by "The New York Times" in a front page article more than a year after his departure. That February 22, 1999 story noted that “Much of the credit for the commission’s resurrection has gone to Mr. Casellas, who presided over an overhaul beginning about five years ago to bring down the backlog, promoted alternative ways to resolve disputes, including mediation and arbitration, and looked to file high-profile lawsuits against companies that jolted other companies into becoming aware of the practices that often spawned discrimination complaints….That the agency is being looked on more favorably is, to some longtime observers in the field, nothing short of amazing.” 
Post-Government Activities.
Volunteer Public Service Activities.
In 1998, after he stepped down as EEOC Chair, President Clinton appointed him to the bi-partisan Census Monitoring Board to oversee the conduct of Census 2000 and named him Co-Chair of the Board in 1999. Created by Congress to monitor the largest peacetime mobilization in U.S. history, the Census Monitoring Board was given responsibility for monitoring all aspects of Census 2000, including operational planning, implementation, and post-census analysis. A detailed account of the activities and accomplishments of the Presidential members is contained in the final report to Congress dated September 1, 2001 and is archived at http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/cmb/cmbp/. 
Private Sector Activities.
During 1998, Mr. Casellas managed the Washington, D.C. office of the San Juan, Puerto Rico based law firm of McConnell Valdés. There he developed a national employment law practice, advising some of the world’s largest companies on diversity, equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination policies. 
In April 1998, he was elected to the board of directors of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and later in 2001, to its newly created holding company, Prudential Financial, Inc. In January, 1999, he left the practice of law when he was named president of The Swarthmore Group, Inc., a registered investment advisory firm. Its assets under management grew from $275 million to $1 billion during his two-year tenure and today ranks among the largest minority-owned asset management firms in the United States. 
From 2001 through 2006, Mr. Casellas also served as a court-appointed member of the Oversight Task Force that monitored the terms of the $192.5 million race discrimination class action settlement by The Coca-Cola Company. The Task Force oversaw broad changes to Coca Cola’s personnel policies and practices throughout its North American operations and reported its findings in annual reports to the federal court in Georgia. 
In June 2005, he joined the Washington DC office of Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky & Popeo, PC in its Corporate Diversity Risk Management Group advising national and international companies and institutions on diversity issues. 
In October 2007, he joined Dell Inc as Vice President for Corporate Responsibility where he led the creation of an integrated and global diversity, sustainability and corporate giving function. After stepping down in 2010, he joined OMNITRU, a Washington, DC-based investment and consulting firm. 
In recognition of his leadership in corporate workforce diversity, he was appointed in 2007 to Toyota Motor North America’s Diversity Advisory Board and in 2012 was named Chairman of the National Hispanic Advisory Council of Comcast’s Joint Diversity Council. In 2009, he was appointed by the Obama Administration to serve as one of the civilian members of the Military Leadership Diversity Commission. Prior to this appointment, and following the withdrawal of Governor Bill Richardson as Secretary of Commerce nominee, Casellas’ name surfaced as a potential nominee to the post of Secretary of Commerce. In a January 16, 2013 letter to President Obama, a coalition of thirty of the largest and most influential Latino civil rights and advocacy organizations included his name among 19 potential candidates for cabinet posts.
Teaching, Advocacy and Philanthropy.
As a third year law student, Mr. Casellas served as an Arthur Littleton Legal Writing Teaching Fellow, teaching legal research and writing to first year law students. During his years as a practicing lawyer in Philadelphia, he served as a Lecturer-in-Law at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, teaching courses on trial and appellate advocacy. He also regularly lectured in CLE programs. In 1995, he was elected to the membership of the American Law Institute. 
In 1996, Mr. Casellas was elected a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1997 through 2006, he was a member of its Executive Committee. He chaired the Neighborhood Initiatives Committee from 1997 until 2007, and thus oversaw the University’s innovative neighborhood collaboration that revitalized the West Philadelphia community and became a national model for university civic engagement. He served as Chair of the Board of Overseers of the School of Social Work (later renamed the School of Social Policy and Practice) from 1997 to 2003, and currently serves as an Overseer of the School of Nursing. In addition to supplementing the endowment of the Latino Project scholarship established at the Law School in 1986, he established the Gilbert F. Casellas Trustee Scholarship for undergraduate financial aid. In June 2006, in recognition of his service, he was elected a Charter Trustee of the University, a lifetime appointment. 
From 2005 through 2008, he chaired the board of directors of the Hispanic Federation, Inc., an umbrella organization whose 100 member agencies serve the health and human service needs of over one million Latinos in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. He previously served as a member of the boards of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, The American Arbitration Association, the National Constitution Center and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. 
Awards and Honors.
Mr. Casellas' many contributions have been acknowledged with numerous awards, including the Spirit of Excellence Award from the American Bar Association, the Clarence Farmer Service Award from the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, the Alumni Award of Merit from the University of Pennsylvania Law Alumni Society, The Alumni Award of Distinction from Penn’s Association of Latino Alumni, and the Lifetime Mentor Award from the Latin American Law Students Association of Temple University. He is also the recipient of a Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service from the U.S. Department of the Air Force. 
In 1997, he was named to the Hispanic National Bar Association’s “short list” of potential candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court.

Siege of Tournai (1340)

During the Hundred Years' War, after the naval battle at Sluys on 20 June 1340, in which Edward III of England dealt the French a heavy blow, he went on to besiege Tournai. This city in Flanders was loyal to Philip VI of France. 
Edward and his forces reached Tournai on 23 July. Apart from the inhabitants, there was also a French garrison inside. The siege dragged on and Philip was drawing closer with an army, while Edward was running out of money. At the same time, Tournai was running out of food. 
Edward's mother-in-law, Jeanne of Valois, then visited him in his tent on 22 September and begged for peace. She had already made the same plea in front of Philip, who was her brother. A truce (known as the Truce of Espléchin) could then be made without anyone losing face and Tournai was relieved.

Ernest Angelo

Ernest Angelo, Jr., known as Ernie Angelo (born March 7, 1934), is a Texas oilman and Republican politician who served from 1972–1980 as mayor of the West Texas city of Midland and was in 1976 the co-manager of the Ronald W. Reagan Texas presidential primary campaign.
With a 2–1 margin among voters in the state’s first binding presidential primary, Reagan won all ninety-six delegate spots at stake. Coupled with a victory five weeks earlier in North Carolina, the historic Texas upset revived Reagan’s floundering campaign and set him firmly on the road to contest with President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., the party’s nomination at the convention held in Kansas City, Missouri. Without the Texas triumph, which occurred on May 1, 1976, and follow-up victories on May 4 in Indiana and Georgia, Reagan could have been forced out of contention for the nomination. And without Angelo and his two co-chairmen, Ray Barnhart of Houston, later the director of the Federal Highway Administration, and Barbara Staff of Dallas County, chairman of the Council of Republican Women's Clubs of Dallas County, at the helm that year, Reagan might have become viewed as a non-starter with little credibility four years later—when he went on to win the presidency by a wide margin of electoral votes.
From 1976 to 1996, Angelo served as the Republican national committeeman from Texas, a position which made him an automatic member of the Republican National Committee.
Background.
Angelo was born in the state capital of St. Paul, Minnesota, to Ernest Angelo, Sr. (1894–1971), and the former Helen Marie Moran (1895–2003). The senior Angelo was a college professor at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia and the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis-St. Paul before he accepted a position with the Louisiana Department of Agriculture in Bogalusa, the largest city in Washington Parish, one of the "Florida Parishes" of the far southeastern section of Louisiana. Angelo, Jr., grew up in Bogalusa and in Covington, the seat of St. Tammany Parish in the New Orleans suburbs. He graduated in 1952 from the Roman Catholic St. Paul's School in Covington and entered the petroleum engineering program at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, from which he graduated in 1956. Thereafter, he served briefly in the United States Air Force and was in the Reserves for eight years.
After LSU, Angelo took a position from 1956–1962 with Gulf Oil in Crane, south of Odessa, Texas. He and his wife, the former Betty Lou "Penny" Pendergraft, who grew up in Galveston and Houston, made their home in Midland, halfway between Fort Worth and El Paso. The couple has four children, Ernest Eugene Angelo of Carmel, Indiana, Helen Marie Kisner, married to Frank Kisner, a retired lieutenant general in the United States Air Force, Patricia Louise Angelo of Lewisville, Texas, and Clifford Angelo (born Father's Day weekend 1973), a consultant and entrepreneur. From 1962–1964, he was affiliated with Sohio Petroleum. In August 1964, Angelo began his own company, Discovery Exploration in Midland with partners Don L. Sparks and Charles Webb Farish.
Midland's "Mr. Republican".
Angelo joined the Young Republicans while a student at LSU. In Midland, he continued his association with the Republican Party. In 1968, Angelo made the first of two unsuccessful runs as a Republican candidate for the Texas State Senate, having lost to Democrat W. E. "Pete" Snelson, then of Midland. Snelson had unseated long-term Senator Dorsey B. Hardeman of San Angelo in the Democratic primary. In that same 1968 general election, Tom Craddick of Midland, was elected at the age of 25 to the Texas House of Representatives. In 2003, Craddick began a six-year stint as House Speaker, the first Republican speaker since Reconstruction. Craddick still serves as the senior member of the Texas House, having been replaced in 2009 by Joe Straus of San Antonio. Craddick and Angelo have been neighbors since the early 1970s. The two oilmen are godparents to the other's children.
The 96-0 Reagan landslide made impressive headlines and followed thereafter with four more at-large Reagan delegates chosen at the state convention. Angelo said the victory was possible because the party was allowed to write its own rules. Some 420,000 voted in the Republican primary in which Reagan polled 278,300 votes to Ford’s 139,994. In the Democratic primary, two candidates easily outpolled Reagan, and a third nearly matched him. Jimmy Carter received 736,032 votes; U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, a favorite son for President and a candidate for reelection, polled 343,033, and George C. Wallace of Alabama drew 270,798 votes. Carter, Bentsen, and Wallace hence polled some three times as many votes as Reagan and Ford combined. The 1976 primary was also the first election in Texas in which counties with at least 5 percent Mexican American ethnicity were required to use bilingual ballots.
While he co-managed the Reagan campaign, Mayor Angelo was chosen national committeeman, a position that he retained for 20 years. After Reagan became president, Angelo tried again for the Midland-based state Senate seat, but he lost in 1982 to the Democrat William “Bill” Sims of San Angelo in Tom Green County, 52,868 (47.9 percent) to 57,522 (52.1 percent). This race occurred about a decade before the region between Midland and San Angelo moved strongly into the Republican camp. In that same year, Bill Clements of Dallas, the first Texas Republican governor since 1873, and George Strake, Jr., a Houston oilman, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor, and later state party chairman, were crushed in an avalanche of Democratic votes. It was the last year through at least 2010 that the Democrats in Texas would win all of the statewide races in Texas, including judgeships. Angelo noted that the poor Republican prospects in Texas in 1982 were blamed on a downturn in the national economy, as Democrats rebounded nationwide in President Reagan's first mid-term election. Angelo said that his defeat by Sims was a “blessing” because he needed to work full-time after 1983 on his business, and being a state senator would have been too time-consuming him to protect his company during a slump. Angelo recalls Clements' defeat by Mark Wells White in 1982 as his most personally disappointing election loss. Only two years earlier, his most exhilarating victory had been that of Reagan over President Carter, four years after Angelo, Barnhart, and Staff had worked to resurrect Reagan in the Texas primary.
The website Americans for Prosperity credits Angelo with "the courage to buck the Republican establishment and support Ronald Reagan. The rest is history. should write a book so we can know more of the details. Ernest Angelo had courage... Had it not been for Ernest Angelo and Texas in 1976, Reagan may not have become President."
Election as mayor.
Angelo’s entry into municipal politics was not the result of personal motivation, but a plea from two friends and fellow businessmen, his neighbor Tom Craddick and Craddick’s predecessor in the legislature, former Representative Frank Kell Cahoon, who had been the only Republican in the Texas House of Representatives in the 1965 legislative session. Mayor Edwin H. Magruder, Jr., who had an impressive World War II record, did not seek a third two-year term in 1972.
Craddick believed that the leading candidate for mayor, Mayor Pro Tem Pat M. Baskin (1926–2005), a former chairman of the Midland County Democratic Executive Committee, would use the office to try to unseat Craddick’s bid for a third term in the House in the 1972 general election. Angelo agreed to run for mayor if Cahoon would seek one of the at-large city council seats. The deal was struck, and both ran and won. Angelo recalls his having defeated Baskin by 150 votes out of some 10,000 cast, a plurality of votes in a system that did not require a runoff election. Angelo considered his opponent to be on the left side of the Democratic Party, but later Baskin switched parties, as West Texas moved increasingly away from the Democrats, and served as a Republican state court judge. Angelo recalls that Baskin was "a gentleman," popular by virtue of his friendly personality and his involvement in community theater.
Municipal matters.

Mayor Angelo soon found himself involved in the details of municipal matters. He recalls that Midland was nearly broke, having less than $300,000 in its unappropriated surplus general fund. He and the council hence called for a sales tax election coupled with a lowering in city property taxes even though such a measure had been rejected a year earlier in 1971. No funds were spent to advertise the tax measure. Angelo and the council took on the responsibility of informing voters of the fiscal problems facing the city. The measure passed easily, and Midland prevailed strongly economically throughout the 1970s.
Under Angelo, the city modernized Midland International Airport. Though it is used by neighboring Odessa, the airport is entirely the possession of the City of Midland. When the University of Texas of the Permian Basin became a four-year institution, plans had been to merge Midland and Odessa junior colleges on the Midland campus under a common community college district. Odessa voters, however, voted down the proposal, reflecting longstanding divisions between the two municipalities of common size and different focus in neighboring Midland and Ector counties. Angelo presided over the building of a new central fire station and Midland Center, a civic meeting facility which opened downtown with a large clientele. The first shopping mall, developed by the Simon Company of Indianapolis opened during Angelo’s tenure. Federal block grants were employed to upgrade Midland streets and to pave the remaining dirt and gravel roads within the city. Angelo said that the city manager, the late James W. Brown, and his assistant, Fred Poe, carried most of the burden of administrative details and provided continuity during his years as mayor. There were some problems with planning and zoning, but the water and sewer infrastructure proved more than adequate.
Angelo worked with four at-large council members, and he could vote to break ties. Now, the Midland City Council has six single-member districts with the mayor able to vote on all matters though his vote might not usually be needed except to break a tie. Angelo said the decision by the U.S. courts to require single-member districts in legislative elections has not been productive, at least in Midland. In the single-member concept, council members tend to be focused only on the parochial nature of their districts, rather than the well-being of a city as a whole. Mayor Angelo won again in 1974, 1976, and 1978 with token or no opposition. He did not run in 1980 and was succeeded by Gaylian Thane Akins (1933–2005), also a petroleum engineer in Midland. Angelo jokes that he took office during a downturn in the West Texas oil industry and “my leadership and the Arab oil embargo got Midland booming”, as greater demand developed for drilling West Texas petroleum. Under the Angelo administration, Midland property taxes became the lowest among the 25 largest population centers in Texas. In later years, Texans found that tax rates themselves were less critical in calculating their payments than the rising assessed values of their property.
Political matters.
Angelo recalls a trip to Midland by U.S. Senator John G. Tower in 1975, when Angelo informed Tower that he would be working in the forthcoming campaign to draft and nominate Reagan. Angelo recalls Tower as having told him that supporting Reagan would be a "dumb thing to do." At the time, all Republican U.S. senators except Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Paul Laxalt of Nevada were committed to Ford. Tower blamed Ford’s defeat in Texas on "Dixiecrats ... the Reagan organization, aided by former Wallace leaders, made a concerted and obviously successful effort to get the Wallace vote in the Republican primary. In addition some section of Ford’s defense and foreign policy alienated some voters who may otherwise have cast their ballot for the president.”
None of the Ford supporters from Texas were delegates to the national convention in Kansas City. Angelo recalls Tower as having "begged" him to allocate a delegate slot for the senator. Angelo said that Tower could be a delegate if he were committed to supporting Reagan, an impossible condition for Tower because of his longstanding commitment to President Ford. Tower hence was not a delegate to the 1976 convention because Angelo was mindful that a close convention contest could have been decided by a handful of delegate votes. Angelo said that he always personally liked and admired Tower though they disagreed on some issues: "John was the best extemporaneous speaker and solid as a rock on most issues." As time passed though, Tower alienated the conservative wing of his party with his support for abortion and opposition to Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. Tower did not seek a fifth term in 1984 and was succeeded by Angelo's friend, Phil Gramm, a former economics professor at Texas A&M University in College Station.
Angelo recalls having attempted to mediate a political dispute between Tower and his 1972 intraparty rival, state Senator Henry C. Grover of Houston, the party's gubernatorial nominee against Democrat Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde. Grover wanted to install Angelo as state party chairman to replace the Tower partisan, George Williford of Austin. Angelo arranged a meeting in a Houston hotel between Tower and Grover, and the two got into a shouting match and nearly came to blows. "Hank was his own worst enemy. He couldn't get along, let personal things interfere in the political realm," recalls Angelo. In retrospect, Angelo theorizes that the 1972 division within the Texas GOP delayed the election of the first Republican governor, Bill Clements in 1978, beyond what would have otherwise been possible.
Angelo's tenure as mayor corresponded partly with that of Jim Reese in Odessa. When veteran Democratic U.S. Representative George H. Mahon of Lubbock retired, an open election developed for the seat in 1978. Reese entered the Republican primary; so did 31-year-old George W. Bush, son George Herbert Walker Bush, the man would become vice president two years later. Bush won the primary and then lost the general election to then Democrat (later Republican) Kent Hance, subsequently a Texas Railroad Commissioner, the chancellor of Texas Tech University, and a particularly successful lobbyist but never a governor or U.S. senator. Angelo stayed out of the Reese-Bush primary, for he had developed good relations with both men.
In the 1980 Republican presidential campaign, Angelo again worked for Reagan, having been the deputy Reagan-Bush chairman under Governor Clements as well as campaign manager of the 1980 general election campaign in Texas. At the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Angelo was chairman of the National Advisory Board for Reagan-Bush. He was chairman of the Texas delegation in 1980 and 1984.
In 1996, Angelo stepped down as national committeeman and was succeeded by Timothy Lambert of Lubbock, a social conservative active in the home-schooling movement. Angelo remains committed to Republican affairs as an insider with comparatively little public attention focused upon him. He has been a fund-raiser for former Texas Railroad Commissioner Michael Lawrence Williams, a conservative African American originally from Midland, who in 2012 lost a Republican primary for the United States House of Representatives, after previously indicating that he would seek the U.S. Senate seat vacaated by the retiring Kay Bailey Hutchison.
Angelo today.
Angelo is affiliated with the Texas Society of Professional Engineers as both the Permian Basin president and the state director. In 1973, he was named "Permian Basin Engineer of the Year." In 1981, he was appointed to the National Petroleum Council by then United States Secretary of Energy James B. Edwards. He served on the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board under Governor Clements, on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission under Governor George W. Bush, and as chairman of the Texas Public Safety Commission under Governor Rick Perry. In 2008, Angelo garnered the John Ben Shepperd Award for Outstanding Texas Leadership, an honor named for the former Texas Attorney General who called both Gladewater and Odessa home. Angelo that same year became a member and director of the Trigon Uranium and the Intercontinental Potash corporations.
Angelo has been a steadfast supporter of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who turned back a determined intraparty challenge on March 2, 2010 from U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison before he defeated the Democratic nominee, former Houston Mayor William Henry "Bill" White. Angelo said that many in the oil industry in Midland support Perry to "to ensure the pro-business climate continues. Midland has a reputation of being a conservative pro-business community."
Angelo is still active as an oilman in Midland. he and his wife reside in the same house on Stanolind Avenue that they bought about 1970. The Minnesota native who was reared in Louisiana is an adopted West Texan who exerts great pride in the city of which he served as mayor. He describes Midland as "a very open community ... where people can excel in any endeavor." He attributes the political climate in Midland and West Texas to the oil and gas industry: "These are people with a can-do entrepreneurial independence who support a conservative philosophy of government."
In 2012, Angelo was a leading supporter of Christi Craddick, his neighbor Tom Craddick's daughter, who won election to the Texas Railroad Commission.

Naval Station Puget Sound

Naval Station Puget Sound is a former United States Naval station located on Sand Point in Seattle, Washington. Today, the land is occupied by Magnuson Park.
History.
After World War I, a movement was begun to build Naval Air Station (NAS) Seattle at Sand Point, and King County began acquiring surrounding parcels. In 1922 the U.S. Navy began construction on the site, which it was leasing from the county, and in 1926 the Navy was deeded the field outright. The name "Carkeek Park" was subsequently given to a new park on the west side of the city, north of Ballard on Puget Sound. This deed amounted to a public gift of $500,000 from the county to the Navy, in 1926 dollars; this would be $5,283,000 in 2005 dollars, not including significant real estate appreciation. The Seattle Chamber of Commerce—a commercial entity—had done the same thing for the Army 28 years before with Fort Lawton, much of which is now Discovery Park.
Sand Point Airfield was the endpoint of the first aerial circumnavigation of the world in 1924. The historic flight helped convince Congress to develop Sand Point as a Naval Air Station.
The former grass runways were paved in 1940-41, just prior to the U.S. entering World War II. The primary runway was aligned 14/32 and was just under a mile in length at 5050 feet (1539 m).
During its years of operation, Naval Station Puget Sound was used as a facility to train naval aviators. Several trainer aircraft were forced to ditch in lake Washington over the years due to pilot error or aircraft malfunction. The wrecks of these aircraft still remain submerged near present day Magnuson Park, where they are often visited by local divers:
Deactivation.
NAS Seattle was deactivated in 1970 and the airfield was shut down; the reduced base was renamed "Naval Support Activity Seattle." Negotiations began as to who would receive the surplus property. In 1975 a large portion of the Navy's land was given to the City of Seattle and to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The city's land was largely developed as a park and named Sand Point Park. In 1977, it was renamed Magnuson Park in honor of longtime U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson, a former naval officer from Seattle. Both names for the park are commonly used. The airfield runways were demolished in the late 1970s and new construction on the north end for NOAA was completed in 1982 (photo - 1981). The installation was renamed "Naval Station Puget Sound" in 1986 and recommended for closure in April 1991, and the remaining land was divided among several entities, including the city. The base was formally closed four years later in September 1995.
The former naval station was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Naval Air Station (NAS) Seattle and designated a Seattle landmark as the Sand Point Naval Air Station Historic District on .

Bob Dalton (outlaw)

Robert Reddick Dalton (May 13, 1869 - Oct. 5, 1892), better known as Bob Dalton, was an American outlaw in the American Old West. He led the ill-fated Dalton Gang raid on two banks in Coffeyville, Kansas. Ambushed by town citizens Bob, Bill Power, Grat Dalton and Dick Broadwell were all killed.
Early life.
The Dalton family came from Jackson County, Missouri. Lewis Dalton was a saloon keeper in Kansas City, Kansas, when he married Adeline Younger, the aunt of Cole and Jim Younger. By 1882, the family moved to northeast Oklahoma, then known as the Indian Territory, and by 1886 they had moved to Coffeyville in southeast Kansas. Bob was one of 13 of the couple's 15 children who survived to maturity. His siblings included: Frank, Bill, Grat and Emmett.
Bob acquired a reputation for being dangerous after he killed a man at age 19. A deputy at the time, he claimed the killing was in the line of duty. The victim, however, was suspected of flirting with a girl that Bob liked.
Lawman career.
Bob's older brother Frank was a U.S.A.U. Deputy Marshal and Bob served with him on several posses. Frank was killed by a gang of horse thieves, the Smith-Dixon Gang, on November 27, 1888 and Bob may have been part of that posse. After that incident Bob wished to be commissioned as a Deputy Marshal in the Western District at Fort Smith, Arkansas and assigned to work for the Wichita, Kansas Court. Additionally, Dalton also served as the Chief of police for the Osage Nation while he was with the Kansas court.
On August 26, 1889, Dalton was sent to Coffeyville, Kansas to arrest a man named Charley Montgomery, who was charged with illegally selling whiskey and stealing horses in Indian Territory. Montgomery resisted arrest and drew his guns forcing Dalton to kill him with his pistol. Since there was no bounty on Montgomery Dalton did not receive any payment when he returned with Montgomery's corpse to Fort Smith. When no one claimed the outlaw's body, as was the custom of the time, Dalton was required to pay for the burial.
In April 1890, both Dalton and his brother Grat were sent to Claremore, Indian Territory to arrest Alex Cochran who had been accused of killing U.S. Deputy Marshal Cox. The Daltons followed a rider fitting the description of the fugitive but the rider attempted to distance himself from the two deputies. The man refused to stop so, from a distance of 300 yards, Bob shot both the rider and his horse. The dead man, unfortunately, was Chochran's son, not Alex himself.
While Dalton continued to work as Police chief for the Osage Nation rumors began that he and his youngest brother Emmett were illegally selling whiskey to the Indians and the brothers became involved in a noisy disturbance with them. U.S. Commissioner Fitzpatrick called Bob Dalton in from the field, when he heard of the news, to demand his badge and discharge him from his position. Angered, Dalton claimed that he resigned, rather than being dismissed, over being cheated him out of several expenses. Charged with selling liquor in Indian Territory he would pay his bail but not appear for his trial.
Early outlaw career.
In July 1890, Bob, Grat, and Emmett were accused of stealing horses near Claremore to sell them in Kansas. With a posse close behind of them Bob and Emmett left the territories for California where brother Bill was residing. Grat was arrested for the crime but would gain his release because of a lack of evidence. He would join his brothers in California.
On the night of February 6, 1891 the Daltons raided a train operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad, near Alila, stealing $60,000. The boys were accused of the crime causing Bob and Emmett to flee the state, with a posse after them, while Grat and Bill were arrested. Grat would be found guilty on July 3, 1891 after a jury trial.
18 months.
Bob and Emmett retreated to the Indian Territories, but the law was still after them, so they decided to hide themselves. When Emmett worked, previously, at the Bar X Bar Ranch he became friends with cowboys Bill Doolin and Bill Power. Acquaintances of Emmett from other ranches included Charlie Pierce, George Newcomb, Charlie Bryant, and Richard Broadwell. Bob, as gang leader, decided they needed reinforcements and the future gang recruits were tough men who would help the brothers rob banks and trains throughout the Oklahoma Territory over the following 18 months.
The Dalton boys, at first, connected with Bryant and Newcomb in Wharton, Oklahoma Territory to rob a train in May 1891 earning $1745. Shortly after the robbery, Bryant fell ill and was taken to Hennessey to see a doctor. After being spotted and arrested by Deputy Marshal Ed Short, during an escape attempt, they would kill each other 
On the night of September 15, 1891 they next robbed was the KATY train at Leliaetta, near Wagoner, Indian Territory. Bob and Emmett Dalton led Newcomb, Powers, Broadwell, Pierce and Doolin on the raid. The gang stopped and boarded the train and then robbed $2500 from the express car.
Grat escaped from jail on Sept. 18 while awaiting sentence in California. He promptly returned to Oklahoma to rejoin his brothers. At the end of May 1892 the three Dalton brothers led Pierce, Newcomb, Powers, Broadwell, and Doolin on another train robbery. At the Red Rock train station, June 1, 1892, the gang positioned themselves to await an approaching train. A train entered the station with its coaches dark, which alerted the gang to a problem, so they allowed it to continue. A second train suddenly arrived which the gang boarded as it stopped at the station. They gang boarded it and robbed it but only collected $50. The gang would later discover that the first train carried armed guards protecting $70,000 of the Sac and Fox Nation annuity.
The gang would make its last train robbery at Adair, Indian Territory on July 14, 1892. The train was again loaded with deputies, but the gang was quick and quiet enough not to disturb the marshals until the job was nearly completed. Exiting from the train the marshals would engage the gang in a violent but short gun battle. The battle would claim the life of an innocent bystander and wound another. The Dalton Gang would escape without casualties but with the cash.
Coffeyville raid.
The gang split to pursue their own goals after the Adair raid. Bob and his brothers were deeply concerned with the pressure put upon them by the law. They decided to make one last robbery to earn enough money to leave the country. Their plan was to rob two banks in the same town at the same time to get the money and to also make history for accomplishing something that no other outlaw gang had even attempted. Their target was their old hometown of Coffeyville, Kansas.
Early on Oct. 5 1892, Bob, Gratton, Emmett, Powerade and Broadwell entered Coffeyville. Tying up their horses in the alley across from the banks, they walked across the street dividing into two groups before entering the Condon National Bank and First National Bank. Well known by the townspeople they were recognized and an alarm was given. Townsmen quickly armed themselves with guns from the local hardware stores and took positions to defend their town. As the Dalton Gang began their escape a gun battle erupted that killed gang members and four town citizens. The lone survivor among the gang, Emmett, was seriously wounded receiving 23 gunshot wounds. He would stand trial for the bank robberies after recovering. Sentenced to life in prison he would be granted a pardon by the governor after 14 years. 
Deputy Marshal Heck Thomas would remember Bob Dalton as the most accurate shot he had ever seen. Dalton is buried at the Coffeyville, Kansas Cemetery under a group marker for himself, his brother Grat, and Bill Power.

Zhengzhou–Xuzhou High-Speed Railway

The Zhengzhou–Xuzhou High-Speed Railway is a proposed high-speed rail line connecting the cities of Zhengzhou and Xuzhou, in China.
The length of the line is 362.39 kilometers and the investment is estimated to be CN¥48.62 billion. It is one of the segments of the future Xulan Passenger Dedicated Line, a high-speed mainline from Lanzhou to Xuzhou, paralleling the existing Longhai Railway line. Presently, the existing Xuzhou-Zhengzhou line is used e.g. by passenger trains traveling from Shanghai and Nanjing to Xi'an, Lanzhou, and points west.
It was announced in November 2012 that the construction work on the line will start the next month (December 2012). The construction project is expected to take 4 years, completing by December 2016.
When the railway is completed, it is expected that one would be able to travel between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou in 80 minutes, as compared to about 2.5 hours taken by the trains on the existing railway.
Stations.
The railway will have 9 stations:

Stephen N. Shulman

Stephen Neal Shulman (1933–2011) was a United States lawyer most notable for representing Egil Krogh during the Watergate scandal. He was also General Counsel of the Air Force in 1965 and Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1966 to 1967.
Biography.
Stephen Neal Shulman was born April 6, 1933, in New Haven, Connecticut. His father was Harry Shulman, a Jewish immigrant from the Russian Empire who was a professor at Yale Law School (he would serve as the law school's dean 1954–55). Stephen Shulman was educated at Harvard College, receiving a B.A. in 1954. After college, he worked for Bendix Aviation in labor relations. He then attended Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the "Yale Law Journal". He received his LL.B. in 1958.
After law school, Shulman spent 1958–59 as the law clerk of John Marshall Harlan II, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. After completing his clerkship, he became an associate attorney at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. In May 1960, he became Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. 
In February 1961, Shulman became the executive assistant of United States Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg. During this time, he served for a time as Vice Chairman of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. The next year, he became Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel and Industrial Relations. In 1964, civil rights was added to his responsibilities. In 1965, President of the United States Lyndon Johnson named Shulman General Counsel of the Air Force. In 1966, President Johnson named Shulman the second Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an office he held from September 14, 1966 until July 1, 1967.
Upon leaving government service in 1967, Shulman founded his own law firm, Kane, Shulman and Schlei. On January 1, 1971, this firm was merged into the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. During the Watergate scandal, Shulman represented Egil Krogh, head of the White House Plumbers. Krogh later told Bob Woodward that Shulman was "instrumental in helping me determine that what I had done was not only illegal but morally wrong." Shulman convinced the United States Department of Justice to enter into a plea bargain with Krogh in 1973. After the Krogh case, Shulman's career focused on tax and employment litigation. Shulman also became managing partner of Cadwalader's Washington, D.C. office, holding this position until he retired in the late 1990s. 
Shulman died of cancer at Georgetown University Hospital on January 22, 2011. He was 77 years old, and survived by his wife, Sandra Still Shulman; three sons, Harry Shulman, Dean Shulman, and John Shulman; and five grandchildren.

Beta negative binomial distribution

In probability theory, a beta negative binomial distribution is the probability distribution of a discrete random variable "X" equal to the number of failures needed to get "n" successes in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials where the probability "p" of success on each trial is constant within any given experiment but is itself a random variable following a beta distribution, varying between different experiments. Thus the distribution is a compound probability distribution.
This distribution has also been called both the inverse Markov-Pólya distribution and the generalized Waring distribution. A shifted form of the distribution has been called the beta-Pascal distribution.
If parameters of the beta distribution are "α" and "β", and if

Alaska-Gastineau Mine

The Alaska-Gastineau Mine (alternate: Perseverance Mine) was a gold mine in Perseverance, about east of Juneau, Alaska, USA. It was briefly the largest gold mine in the world. The mine was operated by the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company.
Geography.
The Alaska-Gastineau Mine was located within the Silver Bow Basin. Its concentrating plant was situated near Thane. The mine had a shaft running through Mount Roberts that reached the Perseverance Mine near Gold Creek. It adjoined the Alaska-Juneau Mine. The mine's low-grade ore is situated on a mountain above the Gastineau Channel. Its ore body covered approximately , more than in length, with of tunnels and crosscuts. According to Jackling, the block of ore had at least 100,000,000 tons above sea level. The property consisted of a group of claims whose lode system covered . It was operated on a 6,000-ton daily capacity.
History.
The mine's large scale development began in 1912. In 1913, while it was under construction, Emile Gastonguay was hired as the mine's chief electrician by managing director, Daniel C. Jackling. Bartlett L. Thane was the manager. Becoming unprofitable, it was shut down in 1921. 
Features.
For a period of time preceding World War I, the Alaska-Gastineau Mine was the largest gold mine in the world. Its mills were said to be the largest and most modern gold-crushing plant in the world. For its time, the ore was handled more economically than in any other Northwest mine.

Preamble and Chapter 1 of the Syrian Constitution

The Preamble and Chapter 1 of the Syrian Constitution is the first part of the Syrian constitution introduced on 13 March 1973. It discusses the basic principles governing all citizens of the Syrian Arab Republic.
Preamble.
The preamble contains the five main principles of the constitution. First, it defines the Arab nation's aspirations in unity, freedom and socialism and stipulates that the means to achieve these aspirations lie in the wider Arab revolution. Second, within the reality of a divided Arab nation, collective defense will be needed to counter the dangers of imperialism and Zionism. Third, affirms the nation's commitment to the march toward the establishment of socialist order. Forth, stipulates that individual freedom is a sacred right and that popular democracy is the "ideal formulation which insures for the citizen the exercise of his freedom." Fifth, states that the Arab revolution is an integral part of the wider world liberation movement for freedom, independence and progress.
This constitution serves as a guide for action to our people's masses so that they will continue the battle for liberation and construction guided by its principles and provisions in order to strengthen the positions of our people's struggle and to drive their march toward the aspired future.
Chapter 1.
Chapter 1 contains 49 articles in four parts and provides the political, economic, educational, and cultural principles and the fundamental rights.
Political Principles.
The first article of the constitution states that "the Syrian Arab Republic is a democratic, popular, socialist, and sovereign state. No part of its territory can be ceded." Article 3 stipulates that Islamic jurisprudence shall be a (not "the") main source of legislation. The article was later amended to include that the president must be of the Islamic faith. The constitution does not declare Islam as the state religion. Article 4 declares that Arabic is the official language of the Syrian Arab Republic and that Damascus is the capital of the nation. Article 8 of the constitution defines the Baath Party as the "leading party in the society and the state," and presents the National Progressive Front as the only framework for legal political party participation for citizens.
Economic Principles.
The constitution defines the state economy as a planned socialist economy which aims to end all forms of exploitation. Three forms of property is presented by the constitution: public, collective and individual property. The constitution guarantees that private property shall not be expropriated except for the public interest and in return for fair compensation.
Educational and Cultural Principles.
Article 21 of the constitution defines the goals of the educational and cultural system:
The educational and cultural system aims at creating a socialist nationalist Arab generation which is scientifically minded and attached to its history and land, proud of its heritage, and filled with the spirit of struggle to achieve its nation's objectives of unity, freedom, and socialism, and to serve humanity and its progress.
Freedom, Rights and Public Duties.
The constitution distinguishes between universal human rights that apply to every human being and those that apply to Syrian citizens only. The constitution guarantees the freedom of expression, assembly and religion for all citizens. It stipulates that the state is the guarantor and protector of the citizen's personal freedom and dignity. The constitution guarantees that all citizens will be equal before the law in their rights and duties. It also states that work is a right and duty for every citizen and that the state will undertake to provide work for all citizens.

Justin Wilcox (American football coach)

Justin Wilcox (born November 12, 1976) is a college football coach, currently the defensive coordinator at the University of Southern California.
Early years.
Born in Eugene, Oregon, Wilcox grew up as the younger of two sons on a family farm (wheat and cherries) in nearby Junction City. He played quarterback at Junction City High School and led the team to the 3A state title as a junior in 1993. He graduated in 1995 and considered Stanford and Arizona, but followed family tradition and accepted a scholarship to Oregon under head coach Mike Bellotti.
Playing career.
After redshirting his first year at Oregon, Wilcox found himself buried on the depth chart and switched to defensive back. A nickel back as a redshirt freshman, he lost most the 1996 season to a knee injury. Wilcox became a fixture at safety until his senior season of 1999, when he was asked to fill a void at cornerback. He was invited to an NFL training camp with the Washington Redskins in 2000, but did not make the final roster.
Coaching career.
Wilcox began his career as a college football coach in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Boise State, under new head coach Dan Hawkins. After two seasons as a GA, he left for the Bay Area to coach the linebackers at California under head coach Jeff Tedford.
Boise State.
After three seasons at Cal, Wilcox returned to Boise State in 2006 as the defensive coordinator under new head coach Chris Petersen. In four years the teams lost only four games, with a 49-4 record. His defenses at BSU were statistically among the highest-rated in the nation during his four years with the Broncos.
Tennessee.
Following the 2009 season, Wilcox accepted the defensive coordinator job at Tennessee under new head coach Derek Dooley. In late December 2010, it was reported that Wilcox was a candidate to replace Will Muschamp, who left Texas for Florida. On New Year's Day, Wilcox announced that he would return to Tennessee for the 2011 season.
Washington.
Early on January 2, 2012, reports emerged that Wilcox was to become the new defensive coordinator at Washington, under head coach Steve Sarkisian. The position was vacant due to Nick Holt's termination days earlier. The announcement was made official later that night.
Personal.
Wilcox is the son of Dave Wilcox, an All-Pro linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Inducted in 2000, he played 11 seasons in the NFL, from 1964 to 1974, all with the 49ers. Dave played college football at Boise Junior College and Oregon. Justin's brother Josh Wilcox was three years ahead in school and played tight end for the Ducks and two seasons in the NFL with the New Orleans Saints, and is now a radio host in Portland, Oregon.

Fuzzy math (politics)

Fuzzy math is a catch phrase used often by politicians to describe numbers, particularly in regard to government spending, that they claim do not add up correctly. It is frequently used by politicians who are dismissing another politician's numbers as doubtful or otherwise inaccurate.
Origin.
The term ""fuzzy math"" was first heard during the debates prior to the 2000 US presidential election. It was used by future president George W. Bush, who dismissed the figures used by his opponent Al Gore. Others later turned the term against Bush himself. The term has since been used by many other politicians in attacks against opponents or various beliefs, such as global warming.

<doc id="31118766" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31118766" title="Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island">
Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island

Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island was a former United States Navy base located on Ward Island, just offshore from Corpus Christi, Texas. During World War II (WWII), this base provided highly classified airborne electronics maintenance training for many thousands of Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, and Royal Air Force personnel.
History.
In 1924, the Radio Materiel School (RMS) opened on the campus of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. The RMS initially provided maintenance training of six months duration for two classes of 30 enlisted men each year. It soon gained the reputation of being the most difficult program to obtain admission as well as the hardest, most advanced training in the U.S. military services. 
The curriculum of the RMS was devoted entirely to the theory and maintenance of radio communication equipment used aboard naval vessels and in shore stations. As electronic equipment advanced, particularly in reduced weight and size, there was increased used in naval aircraft; the maintenance of this equipment, however, was not taught at the RMS—this was left to the user units. As radar was being introduced, this deficiency became a critical issue.
Electronics Training Program.
Immediately after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, an "ad hoc" committee met at the U.S. Navy Headquarters in Washington, D.C., to address the critical problem of electronics maintenance personnel. Radar, sonar, and other types of electronic systems were being developed, but there were almost no Navy personnel qualified to maintain these advanced technologies. Under the leadership of William C. Eddy, a medically retired (deafness) submarine officer, a radically new training program was devised and actually started 12 January 1942. 
After a brief organizational period, this program (commonly called the Electronics Training Program or ETP) had three levels: a month-long Pre-Radio School. A three-month Primary School, and a five-month (later six- to seven-month) Secondary School. Admission to Pre-Radio required passing what came to be known as the Eddy Test, having an estimated 15-percent pass rate. 
Most of the Pre-Radio Schools were in Chicago, many at Junior Colleges taken over by the Navy. Mainly taught by Navy and Marine personnel, these functioned as additional filtering, had a pass-rate of 50 percent or less, and repeating was not allowed. One study found that the average person completing Pre-Radio had 1.5 years of prior college and scored in the top two percent of Intelligence Quotient in the Nation.
Except for a prototype school run by Eddy in the Loop District of Chicago, the initial Primary Schools were operated by six engineering colleges across the nation. Here, the regular faculty condensed the primary topics from the first two years of an engineering curriculum into three months of 14-hour study days. The pass-rate of these schools was about 70 to 80 percent. As in Pre-Radio, repeating of a failed section was not allowed. As the war continued and the demand for qualified technicians increased, five Navy-operated Primary Schools were added.
The Secondary Schools were totally taught by Navy and Marine personnel, and the time was divided between advanced engineering topics and hands-on hardware laboratories. Schools at the NRL (an upgrade from the old RMS), at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay, and somewhat later, at Navy Pier in Chicago, were focused on shipboard and shore-based equipment. NATTC Ward Island (described in the next section) was the Secondary School concerned with equipment carried by aircraft. With the students having already been filtered in Pre-Radio and Primary, the pass-rate at the Secondary Schools was comparatively high (about 90 percent), and repeat of one section was allowed.
Aviation Electronics Training.
Before the start of the war, the Bureau of Aeronautics had decided to open its own aviation electronics school. The Royal Air Force had recently started Training School #31 for this same purpose in Clinton, Ontario, and a small group of U.S. naval officers was sent there in mid-1941 to gather information for a similar school to be located on the campus of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. 
On 2 January 1942, 100 students started classes at Annapolis in what was called the Aviation Radio Materiel School (ARMS). The United States had just declared was on the Axis and Japan, and, even before the school opened, it was realized that a much larger school was needed. The Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC) for training pilots had opened the previous year. Ward Island, along a causeway two miles to the northeast, was ideally suited for a small training station that could be highly secure and draw on the NASCC for support functions. 
The Navy acquired Ward Island in February 1942, facility construction started in May, and the school was commissioned on July 1, becoming a Secondary School of the Electronics Training Program. An Administration Building, two instructional buildings, five barracks, and two mess halls were ready, but only a part of the 240-acre site had been cleared and most streets were unpaved. Instructional personnel and classroom equipment were transferred from Annapolis, as well students in the ongoing class. The first new class from Primary Schools was also started at this time. Commander George K. Stoddard was the initial Commanding Officer. 
In September, the school was transferred from the Bureau of Aeronautics to the Air Training Command and officially designated the Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Ward Island. The first regular class of 106 students graduated in late September, and the following class of 152 students graduated in early October. Thereafter, a new class of 200 students started very two weeks. Initially, only radar topics were given and the instructional period was 20 weeks. 
By mid-1943, most of the island had been cleared and grass planted, the streets and sidewalks were paved, and 77 buildings were in use. As new topics were added, the period first increased to 24 weeks and then to 28 weeks. Beginning in mid-1944, a new class started every week, and the number of students peaked at about 3,100. 
Eventually, there were 87 buildings, including a dispensary with 34 beds, a 4,000-volume library, a 350-seat chapel, an even larger auditorium (destroyed by fire in early 1946), a well-stocked ship’s store, a gymnasium, and a reception center for visitors. There were 17 barracks, several Bachelor Officer Quarters, and 6 mess halls. Outside there were a number of athletic fields and courts (the football field doubled as the parade ground), two swimming pools (every student had to pass a swimming test), and a cross-country track encircling most of the island. The secure compound had 16 instructional buildings and a large hangar with static aircraft. For training in flight, there was a hangar and a small fleet of planes at the nearby Naval Air Station.
Students and programs.
Originally, NATTC Ward Island was primarily intended for training enlisted U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine personnel in advanced airborne electronics. In this, it was a Secondary School in the Electronics Training Program (ETP), and most of the students had previously finished Pre-Radio and Primary Schools. These men usually graduated from NATTC Ward Island with the Navy rating of Aviation Radio Technician (ART) 3rd or 2nd class, or Marine rank of Sergeant or Staff Sergeant. In 1945, the Navy rating was changed to Aviation Electronics Technician's Mate (AETM).
The Marine students, along with the Marine guards, were sufficient in number to warrant a Lieutenant Colonel as the Detachment Commander. This detachment also received training at Ward Island in military strategy and hand-to-hand combat.
Some Navy personnel who had achieved the ART ranking through self-study and apprenticeship (called “striking”) were also admitted directly to all, or certain, courses in the advanced curriculum. There were also U.S. Coast Guard men in the advanced curriculum; most of these had earlier completed a preparatory school given by the Coast Guard that was similar to the Navy’s Primary School.
Although the Royal Air Force (RAF) in Great Britain had equipment similar to that of the U.S., enough of the Navy equipment was being used by the Allies that knowledge of its maintenance was important to the RAF. Thus, the advanced training at NATTC Ward Island was open for approved RAF personnel. The British students would be instructed in separate groups, and occasionally these would have personnel from the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Most of the U.S. students at Ward Island were in the Secondary School of the Electronics Training Program. These students were all Navy and Marine enlisted men. However, in certain of the segments of this school there would occasionally be Warrant and Commissioned Officers. MIT had an advanced radar school that officers normally attended, but the instruction did not include airborne systems; thus, officers needing such instruction were sometimes assigned to NATTC Ward Island. 
For a year starting in late 1942, a special three-month course was given for supply officers. After this course was discontinued, a similar course was started for officers in the WAVES; this continued until the end of the war. Throughout the existence of NATTC Ward Island, refresher courses for both officers and enlisted men were occasionally given.
Instruction and topics.
Primary topics in the Secondary School at NATTC Ward Island were advanced electronic circuits, advanced radio receivers and transmitters, antennas and arrays, synchros and servomechanisms, waveguides and microwave transmission, and cavity magnetrons. Laboratory efforts centered on aircraft communication systems, high-frequency and microwave radar systems, radar altimeter systems, identification, friend or foe (IFF) systems, and long-range navigation (LORAN) systems. In addition to the regular curriculum, there were special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight and the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), both highly classified at that time, and the Navy’s first drone aircraft, the Target Drone Denny 1 (TDD-1).
All of the instruction was held within a highly restricted compound under 24-hour guard from the Marine Detachment. Students did not have access to the training compound after hours, and, when not in use, classroom notebooks were kept in secure containers within the compound. There was, however, a study room in each student barrack and these were usually filled in the evenings. Although textbooks were not issued for the classes, the base had a library with college-level textbooks, and most students purchased standard books such as Frederick Terman’s "Radio Engineering" (McGraw-Hill, 1937).
Closure.
NATTC Ward Island continued for some time after the end of WWII. In mid-1946, a Primary School was added. The entire operation at Ward Island closed in the early fall of 1947, with the instructional program transferring to NATTC Memphis at Millington, Tennessee; about 10 years later, it relocated to Pensacola, Florida.
In November 1947, Ward Island became the site of the University of Corpus Christi, which eventually developed into Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.

John Alvin Johnson

John Alvin Johnson (1915–2005) was a United States lawyer and businessman who was General Counsel of the Air Force from 1952 to 1958; General Counsel of NASA from 1958 to 1963; and an executive at COMSAT from 1963 to 1980, having become CEO by the time of his retirement.
Biography.
John Alvin Johnson was born in Milwaukee in 1915 to a family of Norwegian descent. He was raised in Hammond, Indiana. He was educated at DePauw University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1937. He then attended the University of Chicago Law School, receiving a law degree in 1940. During his time at law school, he met and married his wife Harriet Nelson, an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago.
Johnson practiced law in Chicago until 1943, when he was drafted into the United States Navy. During World War II, he was a naval officer on board the USS "Robert H. Smith" (DM-23). After the war, he studied at Harvard University, receiving a master's degree, and then moved to Washington, D.C. in 1946, joining the United States Department of State as an assistant for international security affairs.
Johnson joined the Office of the General Counsel of the Air Force in 1949. From 1952 until October 7, 1958, he was General Counsel of the Air Force. He was then the General Counsel of NASA from 1958 to 1963.
In 1949, Johnson had moved to Falls Church, Virginia and won election to the Falls Church School Board. In the wake of "Brown v. Board of Education", in 1955, Johnson argued in favor of rapid school desegregation in Falls Church. He opposed Sen. Harry F. Byrd's call for massive resistance to school desegregation. However, he was unable to prevail and Falls Church schools remained segregated. He left the Falls Church School Board in 1958, when he moved to Arlington County, Virginia when he took his job at NASA.
Johnson left government service in 1963, joining COMSAT, as director of international arrangements. He was promoted to Vice President in 1964 and Senior Vice President in 1973. He later served as CEO of COMSAT until he retired in the year 1980.
Johnson died in summer 2005.

Coup d'état of May Seventeenth

Coup d'état of May Seventeenth was a military coup d'état carried out in South Korea by general Chun Doo-hwan and Hanahoe that led Coup d'état of December Twelfth.
On May 17, 1980, General Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to extend martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to Jeju-do. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. To enforce the martial law, troops were dispatched to various parts of the nation. On the same day, KCIA raided a national conference of student union leaders from 55 universities. About 2700 people including twenty-six politicians were also arrested. On May 18, 1980, Citizens of Gwangju rose up against Chun Doo-hwan's military dictatorship and took control of the city. In the course of the uprising, citizens took up arms to defend themselves, but were ultimately crushed by the South Korean army.(Gwangju Democratic Uprising)
In May 20, 1980, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo ordered the National Assembly to be dissolved by deploying troops in the National Assembly. Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee, and installed himself as a member. On 17 July, he resigned his position of KCIA Director, and then held only the position of committee member. In September 1980, President Choi Kyu-ha was forced to resign from president to give way to the new military leader, Chun Doo-hwan.

<doc id="31118987" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31118987" title="Cello Concerto No. 1 (Glass)">
Cello Concerto No. 1 (Glass)

The Cello Concerto No. 1 (also the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra) was written by Philip Glass in 2001. It was one of the first concerti of the twenty-first century. The piece was commissioned by William and Rebecca Krueger, friends of the composer, for the 50th birthday of cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. A typical performance takes 20–25 minutes. The work is paired with the "Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra" as part of Glass' "Concerto Project", a series of collected concerti by the composer. The cello concerto is among the most famous of Glass' works for a solo instrument.
Classification.
The work has noticeable "classical" (as Glass would describe his current musical style) elements in addition to minimalist ones; while it still projects many of the minimalist aspects which characterize Glass' music, it has audible differences, ushering a new look to composition in Glass' more recent musical approach.
Structure.
The concerto is in the standard three movement form (this is notable because, as with the earlier Violin Concerto, Glass did not intend for the work to conform to conventional concerto structure as much as the piece simply developed that way). The three movements comply with the traditional fast-slow-fast tempo configuration.
First movement.
The beginning movement opens with the cello directly introducing the first theme, a dark motif which would vary throughout the piece. The cello then exchanges bursts with the brass and returns to the original theme. We then hear a new, more placid melody, introduced by both the cello and orchestra. The movement progresses as the orchestra appears in full, developing into a fluid yet compact climax, interspersed with periodic cello arpeggios. After several minutes of intense orchestral involvement, the piece suddenly quietens and the second theme is eerily restated on the cello in very high register. The introductory material is then recapitulated by the woodwinds and triangle, with the cello providing a repeating undertone. The first movement closes softly and mysteriously.
Second movement.
The second movement is the concerto's calmest, punctuated by a soft, lyrical flute theme (surprisingly peaceful for Glass). The movement concludes in a similar manner to the first, with a dark, quiet close.
Third movement.
Abruptly, the third movement jolts into play with a short, unexpected burst of the brass, followed immediately by the cello stating the familiar opening theme from the first movement. Afterwards, the cello rises in volume until it unexpectedly fades and the orchestra takes over, progressing with repeating trumpets and rapid bass (not unlike the brass repetition of "Mars, the Bringer of War" in Holst's "The Planets"); this builds into a climactic moment in the movement, an ecstatic, dance-like section with layered harmonies, punctuated by distant clangs of a bell. Afterward, the cello reappears and works with the orchestra until it returns to another crescendo, restating the first climax. Then, with the tambourine continuing the dance-like feel, the orchestra rises and falls, with the cello spiralling downward; the orchestra plays rapid, whirling notes until it reaches resolution. The ghostlike feel of the earlier movements forgotten, the work concludes with distinctive finality, a four-note bang similar to that of Rachmaninov's in his Piano Concerto No. 2 and No. 3.
Premiere.
Glass wrote the concerto to be performed first in Beijing. The piece was premiered at the Beijing Music Festival with the China Philharmonic Orchestra, with Lloyd Webber as soloist and Yu Long conducting, on October 21, 2001. The orchestra had been founded the year before and this concerto was the first work that it played by a major living composer. Glass could not attend the performance; in an interview, he revealed that he subsequently did not attend a playing of the concerto until six years after it premiered. It is relatively popular, but has had little time to attain the level of attention and analysis as some of Glass' earlier concerti or other large-scale symphonic works. However, listeners continue to increase.
"The Concerto Project".
The cello concerto was one of a series of eight concerti designated as part of "The Concerto Project", started in 2000. The work was preceded by the "Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra" (2000), the latter of which is paired with the cello concerto in the recording "Project Vol. 1". Glass wrote the decisively neo-baroque "Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra" in 2002, and the "Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark" in 2004. Other parts of the series include the "Concerto Grosso", the "Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra" and the "Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra", often referred to as "Piano Concerto No. 1". Note that the Violin Concerto No. 2 is not listed as part of the "Project"; it was written eight years after the cello concerto.
There are currently four volumes of the "Project", with eight concerti indicated as members of the series.

A middle-order batsman and occasional offspinner, Jimmy Hansra made his Canada debut as an opener in an Intercontinental Cup game against Kenya in August 2009. It was an inauspicious start, as he was out for a duck and was shunted down the order in Canada's second innings. His turnaround came when he was promoted to No. 5 at the 2011 World Cup. Hansra impressed in the position, top-scoring against Pakistan with 43 before sharing matchwinning partnership with Ashish Bagai to beat Kenya. He made 70 in that match and repeated the score a few days later against New Zealand. As his batting fortunes improved he became a more trusted bowler, regularly delivering his offbreaks inside the powerplay overs. Great batsman to watch and a fun loving guy, good character, and back in his hometown he plays for Abbotsford cricket club. He Also hit six 6's in an Over on 16/06/2013.

Allocasuarina portuensis

Allocasuarina portuensis, commonly known as the Nielsen Park She-Oak, is an extremely rare plant growing in Sydney, Australia. Encountered as a shrub or small slender tree, up to 5 metres (16 ft) tall, it has green drooping branchlets up to 27 cm (11 in) in length. It is dioecious, that is, male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. Measuring 1.2–1.5 cm (0.5-0.6 in) long and 0.8–1 cm wide, the cones are perched on 0.2–1.5 cm long peduncles arising from the branchlets.
It was officially described by Lawrie Johnson in 1989. The specific epithet "portuensis" is from the Latin, meaning “inhabiting a port”, as this species was originally found at Port Jackson. It most resembles "Allocasuarina rigida" and "A. distyla" and can be distinguished by differences in the male flowers. "A. portuensis" was originally identified in 1986 from ten specimens at Nielsen Park, in the city's eastern suburbs. Those original plants have now died. However, efforts to propagate and reintroduce the species began from the time it was identified, and plants were planted at several locations around Nielsen Park and nearby Gap Bluff and Hermit Point. 54 of these remained alive in 2000.
The original habitat was forest over sandstone-based soils, with canopy trees such as Port Jackson fig ("Ficus rubiginosa"), smooth-barked apple ("Angophora costata"), blueberry ash ("Elaeocarpus reticulatus") and cheese tree ("Glochidion ferdinandi"). The understory consists of "Pittosporum revolutum", "Kunzea ambigua" and "Monotoca elliptica". The original range is unknown, as so much of the nearby bush has been cleared.

Wahl-Coates Elementary School

Wahl-Coates Elementary School is an elementary school located in Greenville, North Carolina. It is one of 16 elementary schools located within Pitt County. It is in a unique partnership with Pitt County Schools (PCS) and East Carolina University. The University used its funds to build the facility, while PCS furnished the school. Wahl-Coates currently sits on . It previously was located in two different areas on the East Carolina campus.
History.
The Model School, which was the original name of Wahl-Coates, was built on East Carolina's campus in 1914 and served as a laboratory school for the university, providing student teaching opportunities for university students. The school resulted from an April 21, 1913 meeting between former Governor Thomas Jordan Jarvis, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of East Carolina Teachers Training School, and the Board of Trustees of the Greenville Graded Schools. The two institutions entered into an agreement that would create the Model School. The original school building was located on the northwestern part of the campus. Greenville originally paid for the construction, then East Carolina paid it back. At first the building had only four rooms. A second story was added in 1917. This school building was demolished in 1927, when the new building was built.
On January 29, 1927, President Robert Herring Wright stated he wanted to build another school on the East Carolina campus. East Carolina secured funding from the North Carolina General Assembly. The second building was completed in 1927 on the northeast corner of the campus. The building architecture includes sweeping arches to match the Spanish-Mission style that occurred throughout the early buildings. On September 10, 1928, the new school opened with 257 students and nine teachers. In 1929 a second unit was constructed that added 19,360 sq.ft. A training school wing was added in 1949, a theater in 1951 and a laboratory in 1971. 
In 1959, the school was renamed Wahl-Coates Laboratory School in honor of two of its early teachers. Francis Wahl and Dora E. Coates both worked with the school for 30 years. Miss Wahl was a supervising teacher from 1925-1961 and the principal from 1936 - 1961. Mrs. Coates was a critic teacher from 1922-1929, then taught in the English Department until her retirement in 1951. In 1972 the current Wahl-Coates opened its doors. Today, the former Wahl-Coates is known as the Messick Theatre Arts Building.
In the late 1960s, it was evident, due to rising enrollment, that a new Wahl-Coates was needed. The Board of Education of the Greenville City Schools and East Carolina University jointly developed the new school. The current Wahl-Coates is located approximately one-half mile east of the East Carolina campus on 5th Street. It opened January 3, 1972 with approximately 500 students in grades K-6. In August 1980, the grade structure went to four through six. It changed to its current K-5 in August 1990. Mr. Will Sanderson is the current principal. Wahl-Coates is a feeder school for E. B. Aycock Middle School and Junius H. Rose High School.
Recognition.
The school was a School of Distinction in 1997-1998, 1999-2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. In 2007-2008 principal Will Sanderson was named Media Administrator of the Year by the North Carolina School Library Media Association.
Enrollment.
Wahl-Coates has 435 students, as of fall 2010. Of the total enrollment, eight are Asian, 14 are Hispanic, 273 are Black, 125 are White and 15 are multi-racial.

Nadi Pasha always regarded trade, especially trade with the Europeans, as essential to the prosperity of Harar. He encouraged Europeans to undertake the business of the city, though he insisted that the main wealth of the country was in agriculture. 
Nadi Pasha allowed the Catholic Mission to freely practice her religion in Harar and even allowed the ringing of bells, displaying remarkable religious tolerance, considering the historical period.
Later career.
Nadi Pasha also played a major role in ending the slave trade in the Horn of Africa.
At the end of his career in 1897, Nadi Pasha was appointed Prince of Pilgrimage (Hajj).

Ludum Dare

Ludum Dare (from Latin "to give a game", also known as LD48) is an accelerated video game development competition. It was founded by Geoff Howland and was first held in April 2002. Participants are required to create a video game that fits within a given theme in two days. A unique feature of this competition is that participants often release a time-lapse video of the development of their game.
History.
Ludum Dare was originally only an Internet forum. The first competition—often referred to as "Ludum Dare Zero"—was held in April 2002, with 18 participants. Its popularity turned the focus towards the competitions rather than the forum. The time limit was subsequently increased to 48 hours, because 24 hours were decided to be too few. Since 2011 the competition has seen significant annual increases in numbers of game submissions, partly owing to the public awareness of Minecraft designer Markus Persson, who has participated seven times.
Editions.
Notes:
Competition structure.
Currently, Ludum Dare is held three times a year. In the week preceding each competition suggested themes are subject to votes by prospective participants. A theme is subsequently announced before participants are given 48 hours to create a video game that fits within it. All game code and content must be created during the competition and by a single person, and source code must be included. During the event many participants record multiple screenshots of the development of their game to later produce a time-lapse video. In addition, many broadcast a live video stream, particularly since April 2013, when a widget showing Ludum Dare video streams hosted on Twitch was added to the Ludum Dare website. After the end of the competition participants are given three weeks to play and rate other submitted games to determine the winners. There are no physical or cash prizes, but each participant retains full ownership of their game—some have achieved financial success after developing their initial submission.
As of the 18th edition of the competition, which was held in August 2010, a more relaxed version called the "Jam" was introduced. The Jam, which allows development teams, private source code and an extended development time of 72 hours, takes place concurrently with the solo competition.
A smaller competition called "Mini Ludum Dare" is held during months without a Ludum Dare. These are each hosted by a veteran participant who is free to decide the theme within which the games must fit. The rules are generally the same as in Ludum Dare, but the 48-hour limitation is usually ignored in favor of late participation.

Trulia

Trulia () is an online residential real estate site for home buyers, sellers, renters and real estate professionals. It lists properties for sale and rent as well as neighborhood information and community insights. The company is headquartered in downtown San Francisco and has offices in New York City and Denver, Colorado.
Company history.
Inception.
Trulia's founders Pete Flint and Sami Inkinen met at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Frustrated by the challenge of finding their own apartments in the San Francisco Bay Area, they found that available information was often insufficient, out of date or both. Flint and Inkinen took this opportunity to simplify the process of finding a new home through technology.
Growth.
In September 2005, Trulia launched its beta product, originally only serving properties in California. Soon after, with growing demand from listing agents wanting to give their listings more visibility nationwide, Trulia rolled out across the United States less than a year later. 
In a 2012 review, Trulia reported 22 million monthly unique visitors.
In July 2012, Trulia filed for an initial public offering and stated they would trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TRLA." In August 2012, Trulia revealed they would plan to raise up to $75 million in the IPO. The IPO was priced at $17 per share, and began trading on September 20, 2012 at an opening price of $22.10.
Products.
Trulia offers a variety of products and services for consumers and real estate professionals. These are delivered via their website and mobile apps.
Consumers.
Trulia provides price trend information by using listing and public data which shows how the price of a home has changed over a period of time as well as comparing that house price with other homes in the same ZIP code and the same city.
The company's crime maps use geodata from their partners, including CrimeReports.com, EveryBlock.com and SpotCrime.com, to create a curated map of criminal activity in many U.S. metropolitan areas. Users can view crimes in specific areas and neighborhoods and directly compare the crime statistics of two different regions. They are also able to add comments and advice to the geodata.
Information on local schools and amenities is provided for each property listed on the company's website. This includes, each school's name and contact details, grades taught, the school's GreatSchools rating and whether that school is public or private as well as users' ratings on the area's safety, pet-friendliness, walkability and other criteria. Trulia are also available.
Interactive Commuter and Transit maps show the driving or commute times from any given point in the United States. Using data from OpenStreetMaps and GTFS feeds, a visual representation of commute times is projected onto a geographical map. This provides the ability to see at a glance how far one can travel from any given property in a given amount of time.
Real Estate Professionals.
Trulia provides several paid advertising products for real estate agents. These include Trulia Pro, Local Ads, and Mobile Ads. Trulia Pro provides featured listings which appear higher in search results on the website and personalized lead forms displayed at the top of listings pages. Local Ads allows real estate agents to "lock up" their local area on the website by purchasing all available spots in a ZIP code or city and create customized ads which are displayed on property and search results pages in their purchased markets. Agents can also advertise via Trulia's Mobile Ads apps. As with Local Ads, agents can select the ZIP codes or cities where the ads will be shown.

Barbara Kathleen Snow

Barbara Kathleen Snow, née Whitaker (born 21 February 1921 in Evershot, Dorset; died 2007), was a noted English ornithologist and a trained geologist. She, and her husband, David Snow, formed a close team, becoming among the most influential British ornithologists of the 20th century.
Career and personal life.
In 1958 Barbara, who had been the Warden of Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel, married David William Snow, a highly renowned British ornithologist, in Trinidad. From 1957 to 1961 the Snows worked for the New York Zoological Society at the society's Tropical Research Centre headed by the famous American naturalist, William Beebe. The centre was later expanded and is now known as the research centre in Trinidad. 
Here David Snow began his studies of the oilbirds ("Steatornis caripensis"), and their echolocation abilities which enabled them to navigate to their nests in complete darkness using high-pitched clicks audible to humans (unlike the echolocation sounds of many bats). Barbara joined him in 1957 and from then on they worked together as a close-knit partnership. He and Barbara also began detailed studies of three bird families, the hummingbirds, the cotingas and the manakins, all associated with plants. This work extended over many years in Central and South America and led to important discoveries on the co-adaption between the birds and plants, providing food for the birds while ensuring the fertilising of the plants' flowers and dispersal of their seeds - "an early breakthrough in the integration of behaviour and ecology." 
They focussed for some time on the fascinating and very complex courtship dances of the white-bearded manakin ("Manacus manacus") and the golden-headed manakin ("Pipra erythrocephala"). They came to realise that tropical fruit-eating birds have abundant food resources, and, therefore, a lot of “spare time” which has facilitated the extraordinary flourishing of communal lek displays by male manakins. He described these in several classic papers, while also working with Barbara on other tropical birds.
In 1963 David was invited to become director of the new Charles Darwin Station on the Galápagos Islands. He completed the first real working field station there and set up regular surveying routines. He may have stayed longer, but as he now had a young family to raise, in 1964 he returned to England, following Barbara who had gone ahead to have their second son.
They spent the rest of their careers in Britain. David was appointed Director of Research at the British Trust for Ornithology and later Director of the Natural History Museum’s bird room. They moved out to Tring, Hertfordshire, close to their home. He edited the influential ornithological journal, "The Ibis" for some years and published the valuable two-volume work, "Birds of the Western Palaearctic".
At their home and in the neighbouring countryside they continued their studies - particularly of fruit-eating birds "resulting in "Birds and Berries", of which Barbara was deservedly the senior author as she had done a good deal more of the field work than I had."
Barbara was survived by David who died two years later. They were survived by their two sons. 
"Again, her remarkably acute observation, coupled with endless patience and, perhaps more importantly, delight in the birds around her, from Flightless Cormorants to hummingbirds, enabled her to discover much that could only be discovered by sitting and watching."
Awards.
In 1972 Barbara and David were joint recipients of the American Ornithologists' Union's Brewster Medal.

<doc id="31119216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31119216" title="Ōita dialect">
Ōita dialect

Ōita dialect, or Ōita-ben, is a dialect of Japanese spoken in Ōita Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. Even within the prefecture, regional differences are still prevalent; for example, vocabulary within the Hita and Nakatsu regions tends to differ from that used in other regions of Ōita.
Outline.
Ōita-ben has been strongly influenced by dialects from the Chuugoku region of Japan. For example, compared to other dialects within Kyushu, the sentence-final particle "tai", the contradictory conjunction "batten", and the secondary substantive particle "to" are rarely used. However, the word endings -"ccha" (emphasizing) and -"ken" (explanatory) are frequently used.
Grammar.
Potential forms of verbs.
Apart from the younger generation's tendency to skip the "ra" when forming some standard Japanese potential verbs ("ra"-removed words), the Ōita-ben usage is considered a fairly old custom. For example: "miru"'s potential form being pronounced "mireru" instead of "mirareru".
In addition, there are three forms of potential verbs in Ōita-ben, depending on whether the potential is objective, subjective, or related to personal ability.
-yoru and -choru.
In general, -"yoru" refers to the progression or continuation of an action or occurrence, while -"choru" refers to the completion, continuation, or result of a condition or status. They are common in many western Japanese dialects. -"yoru" can change to -"yon", while -"choru" can change to -"chon" as well.
Usage.
Adjectives.
Keiyōshi change form depending on the vowel before the final "i". The two vowels combine into one elongated sound.
Sounds and phonemes.
Euphonic changes.
Oita-ben employs euphonic changes often during rapid speech.
Accent.
Words in Ōita-ben are accented according to a slight variation of the Tokyo dialect’s pitch accent. The western Hita region, while still considered to utilize the pitch accent of the Tokyo dialect, has some minor differences in intonation, while areas close to the inland Kumamoto and Miyazaki Prefectures sometimes utilize the “no accent” pitch that is characteristic of those prefectures.
Words with accents that differ from standard Japanese.
In this list, the left side is the standard intonation, while the right is the Ōita-ben intonation. The accented part is in bold.
Characteristic Vocabulary.
This section contains some of the typical words and phrases in Ōita-ben. Words are listed according to Japanese alphabetical order with Ōita-ben on the left and standard Japanese on the right. The accented syllable is in bold.

California Green Lodging Program

The California Green Lodging Program, an environmental initiative in California, is an information service that acknowledges and rewards hotels that work to save water and energy and reduce waste to help preserve the environment. According to the State of California’s Department of General Services website, the Green Lodging Program was established in 2004. California Integrated Waste Management Board first oversaw the Green Lodging Program, and then in late 2008 the California Department of General Services took over. This program was initially designed to assist state employees to select hotels that were conserving water and energy, diverting waste from landfills, and providing cleaner air while they were traveling. Since then, the program has expanded to acknowledge and reward hotels that meet the guidelines to become a California green hotel.
In order for a hotel to be considered for entry into the Green Lodging Program, it needs to meet certain standards set by the state. Within the California Green Lodging Program there are two levels of recognition: one palm tree is the participation level and two palm trees is the leadership level. The participation level is the entry level. This means the hotel may not have a written environmental policy in place, but within three years of their enrollment the hotel needs to show increased improvement so they can be bumped up to the leadership level. The leadership level means the hotel has a written environmental policy in place and meets all the criteria for the program. The hotel is required to fill out a “hotel survey” that determines if they meet any of the palm tree levels. The survey asks the individual hotels about the following criteria (California Department of General Services, 2010):
Once this is returned to the state, Green Lodging staff conducts a field survey and a program evaluation. In order for the hotel to meet the participation level they must achieve a score between 250 and 300, whereas the leadership level requires a score above 300 points. Although much research has been conducted on the matter, there is little transparency in the evaluation and scoring process. There is no fee to be involved in the program because it is non-regulatory and participation is voluntary. The state currently does not have a recertification process, but they are developing one (California Department of General Services, 2010).
Environmental problem.
There are many environmental problems this program attempts to solve. Hotels continue to be large consumers of goods, produce large amounts of solid waste and use a considerable amount of natural resources. According to Green Hotel Review’s website, a single hotel purchases more items in a week than one hundred families do in a year. Each room within a hotel can produce thirty pounds of waste per day; of this nearly eighty percent can be recycled. Each year the lodging industry spends $3.7 billion a year on energy. Individual rooms consume 218 gallons of water per day and water-efficient fixtures can reduce this number by twenty-five to thirty percent.
After realizing these numbers, hotels can make a big impact on saving natural resources by just making a few changes. Southern California naturally has less water so planting native plants can assist in water conservation.
Causes.
California has a major hospitality and tourism economy. According to California’s Travel website (www.visitcalifornia.com), California had 335 million visitors in 2009 that spent approximately $87.8 billion. California has the largest share of visitors in the U.S. domestic travel market. A majority of the tourists choose to stay in middle to high-end hotels (40%), while only 19% stayed in private homes (this included people visiting friends and families). The hotel industry employed 506,200 people in 2009. Based on these numbers, the waste accumulated from hotels is far more than the average U.S. state.
Due to the negative physical externalities from the travel market, the state wanted to encourage more green behavior from the hotels. In order to get involved in the green business trend, California began a program to promote hotels that were making environmentally friendly choices. Economics has a concept of information asymmetry, which concludes that market inefficiencies occur when one party has more knowledge about a product, or industry, than another. This can sometimes mean the seller has more information than the buyer, leading the seller to manipulate the buyer into purchasing more of something than is necessary. With technology increasing, the likelihood of asymmetric information happening is declining.
By having a large number of tourists staying in upper-end hotels, the hotels could set themselves apart by “selling” the green amenities they offer. Per the U.S. Green Building Council, the benefits of becoming green are: 8-9% operating cost decrease, 7.5% building value increase, 6.6% return on investment improves, 3.5% occupancy ration increases and 3% rent ration increases (Saunders, 2009). These are all enticing reasons for hotels to go green. The Green Lodging Program utilized Kimpton Hotels as the launch hotel in 2004 (Environmental Evangelism, 2005). This hotel is considered a luxury/boutique hotel that stressed environmental sensitivity. Research conducted by Kuminoff, Zhang and Rudi found that travelers were willing to pay approximately $8.97 to $45.43 more to stay in a green hotel (2009). The Green Lodging Program is also a medium for advertising for the hotels.
Program solution.
The Green Lodging Program was initially designed to encourage government travelers to stay at environmentally friendly hotels. Since then, hotels have used the program as a marketing tool to attract common travelers. The California Green Lodging Program uses education as their tool to encourage participation. This, in turn, allows the hotels to use it to their advantage to market to the public as a green hotel. The program specifically targets hotels in California while also providing information to state and local government employees. The Department of General Services (DGS) oversees the program. The website declares their purpose as “help(ing) to better serve the public by providing a variety of services to state agencies through innovative procurement and acquisition solutions, creative real estate management and design, state-of-the-art telecommunications, environmentally friendly transportation, and funding for the construction of safe schools.” (2009).
Gore (p. 341) discusses the concept of “green labeling” as a mechanism for limiting asymmetric information in the economic market. “Full information about who is responsible for environmental damage will also be an increasingly important way to make market forces for the environment instead of against it.” (p. 341). If private companies and public agencies continue to educate people about the effects on the environment, then individuals will be equipped to make better choices, therefore helping the environment. Gore is concerned that private businesses manipulate the green concept since there is no government regulation determining what the criteria are for considering products green. The California Green Lodging Program addresses this by developing standards and a scoring system so that a common traveler can understand what a green hotel is.
Since this is a fairly new program, it has undergone few changes except for changes to the scoring mechanism. As technology changes, the aspects that the hotels are scored against have to change.
Stakeholder analysis.
The stakeholders involved in the program are hotel owners, hotel board members, hotel employees, state and local government employees, general public, California’s Department of General Services, the Governor of California, and green product manufacturers. The hotel owners and the board members have an interest in this program because it can boost their market population therefore increasing their business/profit. The hotel employees will be given new job duties if the owners/board members decide to implement green procedures. The state and local government employees along with the general public chose what hotels to stay in.
The Department of General Service’s mission is to serve the public through the state agencies with innovative and eco-friendly technology. This mission is what the program wishes to accomplish. The Governor improves his political image by encouraging hotels to be greener. The last stakeholder is the green product manufacturer. They have a lot of money invested in research and development for their products. They only want to sell their products so this program is free marketing for them. Manufacturers can motivate purchases by marketing them based on how they will help ensure compliance with and/or a higher rating in the program.
The behavior that the program is targeting to change is the purchasing habits of state and local government employees. The California Green Lodging Program is also indirectly altering the hotels’ behavior toward environmentalism to be in line with what the customer wants.
The green material manufacturers market their products to hotels knowing that the hotels want to be friendlier to the earth. Research shows that customers will pay more to stay in a greener hotel. The following is an example taken from a presentation by EcoLogical Solutions Inc. (2009) regarding why hotels should become green:
The California Department of General Services “Green Lodging Program” lists the hotels that have been distinguished on their website. The hotels also promote this honor on their websites, which is additional marketing power that the hotels receive due to their effort to be green.
Evaluation.
In the research conducted, the program has not been evaluated. This may be because the program does not have any income and has minor, if any, expenses. Currently, there are 212 hotels in northern California and 240 in southern California that are listed on the Green Lodging Program database. Out of 23,000 total hotels in California, only 452 hotels are recognized as being “green.” (CA Dept. of Finance & CA Dept. of General Services). The state of California has information on their website (CA Dept. of General Services) about coming up with new ideas on how to enhance the program, but no specifics. Across the nation, other states have very recently implemented green lodging programs. This will provide for California’s Green Lodging Program to be evaluated against other state programs and determine how they recognize green hotels.
Other hotels have published their savings by following “green” practices. One hotel began cutting electricity usage and installed energy efficient fluorescent light bulbs since 1999 and has saved more than $585,000 (Wolff, 2005). The Fairmont Royal in Toronto insisted on reducing the packaging that came with the products they regularly purchase. By using a new product that was equivalent to 750 sheets of Bounce fabric softener, it saved the hotel from purchasing 23,000 sheets of Bounce (Wolff, 2005). By using water efficient appliances, hotels can expect to save 25-30 percent on their water and sewer bills (www.calrecycle.ca.gov)
The California Green Lodging Program is designed to promote green hotels to state and local government employees to stay at while traveling. The hotel industry uses enormous amounts of resources and the program wants travelers to know that this is not how the industry has to be. The program has two levels of distinction and the hotels simply apply and are evaluated. The state publishes on their website which hotels meet the qualifications for all to see. Hotels can use this distinction to their advantage for marketing and encourage all travelers to stay with them. If the program continues to grow, more resources will be saved.

Little Boys

"Little Boys" is the fourth episode in the third season of the television series "How I Met Your Mother" and 48th overall. It originally aired on October 15, 2007.
Plot.
Lily tells Robin she will set her up on a date with a guy named George. After she lists his good qualities, Ted points out that she has not mentioned his flaw (or as the gang call it, his "but...") though when pushed, Lily reveals that George has a son in her kindergarten class. Despite Robin's personal dislike of children, she goes on a date with George and ends up meeting his son, Doug.
After some initial hesitance and an argument about how cereal should be served, Robin and Doug actually hit it off. However, when Robin decides to break up with George before Doug becomes attached to her, Lily shows Robin a picture that Doug has drawn of his "new mommy". Despite Robin claiming otherwise, everyone else believes the woman in the picture is Robin. Lily informs Robin that if she breaks up with George, she must break up with Doug as well – Robin reluctantly agrees.
Meanwhile, Ted ridicules Barney's latest pick-up plan (a story involving snakes and an eye-patch) and the two argue about who has more "game", while, to his dismay, Marshall is classed as irrelevant. To settle the argument, Ted and Barney select a girl from the bar to see who can sleep with her first. While Ted is distracted Barney makes his move, only to be slapped in the face. Barney explains this is because he had already slept with the girl the year before and therefore, has won the bet, but Ted rules otherwise and begins his pick-up attempt and succeeds.
Ted and Stacey, the girl from the bar, have begun dating so he gloats to Barney about winning the bet. However, Barney makes Ted uncomfortable with thoughts that Barney has already been with Stacey and Ted breaks up with Stacey, admitting to Barney and Marshall that he was unable to get past the thought of her and Barney together. Barney reveals that he had not slept with Stacey at all; on the night of the bet, he asked Stacey to slap him to make it appear as though she hated him to set up the entire ruse that they had slept together. As Ted gloated his dates with Stacey, Barney learned various details about Stacey's life so that he could be there for her when she broke up with Ted. However, one month later, he finds himself bored and frustrated for agreeing to Stacey's request to take things slowly since her experience with Ted.
Robin goes to see Doug and takes advantage of the fact that he has never been dumped before by using "every cliché in the book" but she is interrupted by the arrival of George's new girlfriend, Brooke, whom she realises is actually the woman in Doug's drawing. Lily tries to comfort Robin after her breakup, but cannot believe she was dumped by a six year old. Robin claims she is done with kids but Future Ted narrates that she would eventually make her peace with kids and go on to appear in some important works of art – pictures drawn by his kids of themselves with "Aunt Robin".
Critical response.
Donna Bowman of The AV Club rated the episode C-. She complains the episode 
has a "Friends"-esque pair of premise and is "executed with a tin ear and slack discipline" a criticism she even reiterates the following week.
Staci Krause of IGN gave the episode 8.5 out of 10.

Tyler Johnson (ice hockey)

Tyler Johnson (born July 29, 1990) is an American ice hockey center. He currently plays for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL).
Playing career.
Junior.
Johnson was selected by the Spokane Chiefs with their 11th-round pick in the 2005 WHL Bantam Draft. In his first season with this team, the 2007–08 season, he appeared in 69 regular season games, scoring 13 goals and 29 assists that year. The Chiefs won the Ed Chynoweth Cup that season as the league's champions. As the league's champions, the Chiefs subsequently earned a berth in the 2008 Memorial Cup, where they defeated the Kitchener Rangers by a score of 4-1. Johnson played in all 21 playoff games, scoring five goals and adding three assists. He was named the WHL playoffs Most Valuable Player, as a 17-year-old rookie. 
In his 2008-09 season, he played in 62 games, and had 26 goals and 35 assists for 61 points, and added another five goals and three assists in 12 playoff games. The 2009–10 season saw Johnson's numbers improve, as he tallied 36 goals and 35 assists in 64 games. He also added three goals and five assists in 7 playoff games.
Johnson's 2010–11 season has proven to be his best yet. He became the 15th Spokane Chiefs' member all-time to hit the century mark (100 points), with 53 goals and 62 assists, making him the leading goal scorer and second-leading points scorer in the Western Hockey League. During this season, Johnson established career highs in goals with 53, assists with 62 and points with 115.

Professional.
Johnson signed a professional standard three-year entry-level contract with the Lightning in March 2011. Johnson's smaller size is known to be the reason he went undrafted.
Johnson started the 2011–12 season with the Norfolk Admirals. In March, he went on a 13-game scoring streak, including back-to-back two goal games, the longest streak by an AHL rookie in more than 6 years. This streak helped him earn the Reebok/AHL Player of the Month award for March 2012.
In his rookie NHL season with the Lightning in 2013–14, Johnson became entrenched in Tampa Bay's top offensive line and finished with 24 goals and 26 assists for 50 points in 82 games. He was selected as a NHL Calder Trophy Nominee. The trophy eventually went to Nathan MacKinnon of the Colorado Avalanche, while Johnson was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team .
International play.

Vangelis Vitalis

Vangelis (Evangelos) Vitalis (born 1969) is a New Zealand diplomat and trade negotiator. Vitalis is also known as the first Greek-New Zealander to be appointed ambassador.
Career.
The following information has been provided, updated and maintained by Hellenes Abroad on behalf of the Greek-New Zealand Community
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Wellington, New Zealand.
Vitalis is believed to have joined the New Zealand Ministry of Foreignn Affairs and Trade in late 1993, during which time he worked on the Africa Desk and subsequently worked for three months in New York as a junior New Zealand Foreign Ministry delegate to the United Nations General Assembly - this was also during the time that New Zealand was a member of the UN Security Council. On his return to New Zealand, Vitalis worked in the Ministry's Economic Division until he was posted to the New Zealand Embassy in Moscow as Second and then First Secretary followed (1997–1999), including a year's language training at the Moscow State Linguistic University (1996).
Russian Ministry of Agriculture, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Vitalis then worked for a time at the Russian Ministry of Agriculture as part of a team developing a partial equilibrium model to assess the potential impact of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization on its agricultural sector (1999–2000). Vitalis was an early advocate of the need to analyse Russia's agricultural policies at the federal and sub-federal level. He suggested that this was the only way to establish the full picture of Russian agricultural subsidisation a point reinforced in a paper he published on the subject [http://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/dspace/bitstream/10182/596/3/cd_dp_70.pdf]. He also worked briefly during this period in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as an adviser on a range of diverse issues including currency reform and WTO accession.
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, France.
From 2001 to 2011, Vitalis worked in various roles at the OECD. Between 2001 and 2004 he worked in Paris for the OECD Secretariat as a Chief Adviser. In particular, he headed a unit charged with providing the analytical papers to support the Ministerial-level OECD Round Table on Sustainable Development This influential body was chaired by the former New Zealand Minister for Environment and Associate Minister of Finance, Rt Hon Simon Upton. Ministers from a range of countries participated in Round Table meetings, including from France, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Sweden, Canada, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Brazil and South Africa among others. The unique format of the Round Table also included leading NGOs, such as Greenpeace and WWF, alongside business organisations such as the World Business Council on Sustainable Development, Shell, BP and so on. The unit (which fluctuated in size from up to eight analysts) led by Vitalis and reporting to the Rt Hon Upton prepared a number of ground-breaking economic papers on a range of sustainability-related issues [http://www.oecd.org/pages/0,3417,en_39315735_39313128_1_1_1_1_1,00.html, including how to measure sustainable development a set of measurements for a range of sustainable development-related issues [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/3/12/39365131.pdf, measuring embedded carbon flows (i.e. a consumption flow model) the potential synergies between investment flows and ODA [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/12/39369700.pdf, subsequently included as a chapter in a book published by the OECD and a controversial paper on the rise of eco-labels and their trade and environment-related effects [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/30/39362947.pdf. Together with Rt Hon Upton, Vitalis produced an economic analysis and a set of policy recommendations to address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on the high seas (IUU) This analysis ensured that Vitalis was included as an Economic Expert Adviser to the prestigious and high-level OECD IUU Ministerial Task Force (2004-5)[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/2/28/39375276.pdf and subsequently chaired the OECD Trade and Environment Committee (2008–to the present), including the OECD Global Forum on Trade and Climate Change (2009).
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Wellington, New Zealand.
Vitalis rejoined the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2004 and worked in the Economics Division of the Ministry as the Head of the Trade and Economic Analysis Unit. He initially worked on a set of papers on international economic issues relevant to New Zealand as a way of informing the development of the Government's Growth and Innovation Framework. It is during this time that Vitalis is believed to have first advocated the development of a customs union between Australia and New Zealand - he is known to have opposed a currency union. He also proposed the establishment of a "Minister for Australia" to take this idea forward as a way to 'refresh' the Closer Economic Relationship between Australia and New Zealand in time for the twenty-fifth anniversary (in 2008) of the launch of that agreement. 
Vitalis also managed the (general equilibrium) modelling work for the Joint Study assessing the potential benefits of the China-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA)He then transferred to the Trade Negotiations Division and became the investment chapter lead negotiator in the China-New Zealand FTA and the lead New Zealand negotiator for the treaty-status trade & labour, and trade & environment agreements between China and New Zealand, which were negotiated alongside the China-New Zealand FTA (2004-8)[http://www.chinafta.govt.nz. New Zealand was the first OECD country to conclude an FTA with China. 
It was during this period that Vitalis also contributed a chapter on the impact of OECD countries' trade policies on developing countries for a book edited by Robert Picciotto (former Director-General (Operations Evaluation) of the World Bank He also published articles in The Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences, including on the linkage between economics, science and sustainability [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a713682452~frm=titlelink?words=vitalis and an assessment of the sustainable development effects of New Zealand's ground breaking agriculture reforms In 2005, Vitalis contributed a chapter on the intersection between agricultural, trade and environmental policies to a book edited by Thomas Lines of the International Institute for Sustainable Development [http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hNCtsF8YAfMC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=vangelis+vitalis+trade+agriculture+environment+and+development+win-win-win&source=bl&ots=8SEs6PYHAj&sig=92g5KRbmvKiMue-XzMezhXA9aHc&hl=th&ei=zp70TY2qD8fLrQeV97jPBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=vangelis%20vitalis%20trade%20agriculture%20environment%20and%20development%20win-win-win&f=false. The following year, Vitalis' work on agricultural reform and the impact of subsidies on both the economy and the environment formed the basis of a chapter in a book published by the OECD as part of its series on subsidy reform and sustainability [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=DNbREWi-qrkC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=vangelis+vitalis&source=bl&ots=-XBxlQT98z&sig=7dgHuC7UQB72P81pvPg9xvlNEIs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=O74NT8wGxISFB6j5tZAE&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=vangelis%20vitalis&f=false].
Vitalis has been a senior New Zealand negotiator at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) including on trade and environment-related issues (2004-8). In particular, he is believed to have played an influential role in the WTO negotiations on environmental goods, including by chairing the 'Friends of Environmental Goods' process which collectively identified and tabled at the WTO more than 150 specific products as environmental goods (2004-7). The 'Friends' grouping included primarily OECD countries. Vitalis is also believed to have first proposed the innovative 'living list' concept also formally tabled at the WTO by New Zealand. Such a 'living' process would enable the regular updating of any list of products agreed at the WTO to ensure that the list keeps pace with the rapid evolution of environmental technologies At the same time, a series of papers tabled by New Zealand at the WTO and also believed to have been written by Vitalis proposed the establishment of a Voluntary Consultative Mechanism (later, a Voluntary Consultative Process) as a Pareto optimal way to address the apparent intersection between trade measures contained in Multilateral Environmental Agreements and the WTO Agreements [http://www.panda.org/downloads/policy/measwto.pdf. It was during this time that Vitalis also produced his analysis of the relationship between trade, innovation and competition in the New Zealand context - a paper subsequently published by the OECD [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/6/17/41077830.pdf]. 
Vitalis was appointed New Zealand's Chief Negotiator for the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) (AANZFTA; 2008–10) He was also appointed simultaneously to lead the Malaysia-New Zealand FTA (MNZFTA; 2009–10) negotiations which at that time had been stalled for over eighteen months. Vitalis successfully led the New Zealand teams which concluded both the AANZFTA [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aul8rxM98Jg4 and revived the moribund MNZFTA process such that less than six months later the MNZFTA was also concluded and came into force on 1 August 2009 [http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=business&file=/2010/7/31/business/6771253. The signing of the agreement with Malaysia took place in Kuala Lumpur and was overseen by the Malaysian and New Zealand Prime Ministers and a sixty-member New Zealand business delegation [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/pm-welcomes-nz-malaysia-fta-signing]. 
At the time of the conclusion of the AANZFTA and MNZFTA, ASEAN was New Zealand's third most important trading partner after Australia and China and Malaysia was New Zealand's eighth most important trading partner. The ground-breaking AANZFTA was the first agreement negotiated jointly by Australia and New Zealand. It is characterised by a range of WTO-plus commitments made by ASEAN in areas as diverse as goods, services and intellectual property rights. The agreement is also characterised by the innovative use of an 'economic cooperation' chapter explicitly designed to help ASEAN members effectively implement the agreement. In particular, with its 'built-in' agenda, the AANZFTA is a 'living agreement' The deadline for the elimination of tariffs in the AANZFTA mirrors that of the China-New Zealand FTA, i.e. twelve years and is a significant improvement on the existing Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership which eliminated tariffs on New Zealand products within twenty years. The Malaysia-New Zealand FTA contains a number of significantly AANZFTA-Plus provisions, not least the elimination of a 15% tariff on kiwifruit and a range of new services commitments ensuring that New Zealand education, engineering and environmental service providers have a 'first mover' advantage over their competitors ([http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/trade-agreement/malaysia/mnzfta-key-outcomes.pdf and Vitalis' leadership in successfully concluding the AANZFTA was specifically acknowledged by the then New Zealand Minister of Trade, Hon Tim Groser [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/speech-asean-australia-new-zealand-free-trade-agreement-seminars and during the New Zealand parliamentary debate on the ratification of the agreement itself Vitalis also led the New Zealand AANZFTA 'roadshow' which promoted the opportunities presented by this plurilateral agreement to New Zealand stakeholders in all of the main centres of New Zealand [http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz/news-and-updates/?start=5.
New Zealand High Commission, Canberra, Australia.
Following the successful conclusion of AANZFTA, Vitalis was appointed the New Zealand Deputy High Commissioner in Canberra from 2009 to 2011, during which time he also completed the Malaysia-New Zealand FTA. The relationship with Australia is New Zealand's most significant and the High Commission is New Zealand's largest globally. Following the retirement of the High Commissioner, Dr John Larkindale, Vitalis was Acting High Commissioner from November 2010 to May 2011. His period as Acting High Commissioner coincided with Australian Prime Minister Gillard's historic address to the New Zealand Parliament and the Christchurch Earthquake following which both then Prime Minister Gillard and Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbot along with Foreign Minister Rudd were invited by Vitalis to the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra to sign the official condolence book for the victims of the earthquake in New Zealand's second largest city [http://gallery.foreignminister.gov.au/Photo-Gallery/Meeting-at-NZHC-Canberra/14801000_pV79wd/1103934773_JMW2W#!i=1103934689&k=FoS62&lb=1&s=A
In 2009-10, Vitalis was instrumental in the establishment by New Zealand of the Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform (FFFSR) grouping. This non-G20 group of countries has two inter-related objectives: to support the G20's ambitions for reform and elimination of fossil fuel subsidies; and to support the need for greater transparency around the data for such subsidies. Vitalis spoke at the launch of the initiative in June 2010 and also at a GSI-UNEP-WTO Conference [http://www.globalsubsidies.org/research/gsi-unep-conference-increasing-momentum-fossil-fuel-subsidy-reform-developments-and-opportu on the subject later that year. The FFFSR currently comprises Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden. The grouping has been active at APEC and the UNFCCC to advance its case that reform of fossil fuel subsidies can make a meaningful difference to both economic and environmental outcomes. In this regard, the FFFSR works closely with a leading NGO, the Global Subsidies Initiative based in Geneva [http://www.globalsubsidies.org/research/fossil-fuel-subsidies]. The initial meetings of the FFFSR were held in Paris to conicide with Vitalis' travel to Paris to chair the OECD Committee on Trade and Environment. 
In 2010, Vitalis was invited to Manila by the Asian Development Bank to present a paper as part of its regional economic integration seminar series. The paper essentially argues that preferential trade agreements could in fact be drivers of meaningful liberalisation and thus integration and thus presents an intriguing reference point to the 'stumbling blocks' thesis posited by Bhagwati and others He reprised a more elaborate version of this paper at a Boao Forum event in Beijing in December that year [http://www.boaoforum.org/html/ac2010/myrcen.asp. There were strong rumours in mid to late 2010 that Vitalis had resigned from the New Zealand Foreign Ministry and had secured a senior role at the Asian Development Bank to work on regional economic integration.
New Zealand Mission to the European Union, Brussels.
In early 2011, Vitalis was appointed New Zealand Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels, with cross-accreditations as New Zealand Ambassador to NATO, Belgium, Bulgaria, Romania and Luxembourg. Vitalis is the first Greek-New Zealand Ambassador. He formally presented his letter of credentials as the New Zealand Ambassador to the European Union to President Van Rompuy on 15 November 2011 [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/council/photographic-library?command=PIC&pic=1&bid=201&lang=en&rubrique=455&dateEvent=15/11/2011&id=&picid={b209332f-1837-4773-8de6-9050899b9a8e] and to President Barroso on 23 December 2011. In late 2012, as a consequence of a restructuring in the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the closure of the New Zealand Embassy in Stockholm, Vitalis was appointed New Zealand's Ambassador to Sweden (located in Brussels), alongside his on-going responsibilities as New Zealand's Ambassador to the European Union and NATO. He presented his credentials in Stockholm in early 2013. Given the expansion of his responsibilities to include Sweden and the FTA with the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan (see below), Vitalis' accreditations to Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania and Bulgaria were transferred to the New Zealand Deputy Head of Mission to the EU in Brussels, Paul Wilson who became a full Ambassador to those countries. 
Vitalis presented a paper at the World Agricultural Forum held in December 2011 His presentation [http://www.worldagforum.com/files/Vangelis_Vitalis_TRADE_AID_AND_AGRICULTURE_TALKING_POINTS_for_WAF_Congress_Brussels.pdf emphasised the important linkages between trade, agriculture and development citing in particular the possibility of focusing development assistance including through the effective implementation of trade agreements as a mechanism to encourage and facilitate investment and trade flows He made particular reference in his presentation to the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA which features assistance for implementation of the agreement in a manner designed to ensure that the benefits of the agreement are effectively harnessed across ASEAN member states [http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz. 
In early 2012, Vitalis was formally appointed as New Zealand's Chief Negotiator for the Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan-New Zealand FTA [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/groser-announces-new-zealand%E2%80%99s-new-russia-fta-lead-negotiator]. 
In early 2013, Vitalis was appointed as the New Zealand Minister of Trade's 'Special Envoy' in support of Hon Tim Groser's campaign to become WTO Director-General. As a Russian-language speaker Vitalis' focus during Minister Groser's campaign was on the WTO Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Vitalis is believed to have travelled to Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan where he lobbied those countries on behalf of the New Zealand Minister.
Education.
Vitalis is believed to have attended schools in Greece, Germany (Andreanum, Hannover), Fiji (Veiuto Primary School, Lautoka) and in New Zealand (Palmerston North High School). He studied at Auckland University and Harvard. In addition to English, Vitalis speaks German, Greek and Russian.
Personal life.
A Greek-New Zealander, Vitalis' parents emigrated to New Zealand in 1980. Vitalis is married to Tanya Jurado (a Colombian-New Zealander), a widely published expert on SME policy development [http://jmo.e-contentmanagement.com/archives/vol/17/issue/3/article/3935/the-reality-of-management-development-in-smes-]. They have three children. Vitalis speaks Greek, German, and Russian and is a keen recreational (land-based salt water) fisherman, as well as, according to his Twitter home page, an 'ever hopeful' fan of Wellington Phoenix football club, the All Whites (the New Zealand national football team) and Olympiakos Piraeus, the Greek association football club.

<doc id="31119362" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31119362" title="Raja Jagat Singh">
Raja Jagat Singh

Raja Jagat Singh Pathania (1618–1646) succeeded Suraj Mal (his elder brother) as the king of Dhameri (now Nurpur) in present-day Himachal, India. He was the second son of another former king, Basu Dev. The golden period of Pathania rule in Dhameri came under the reign of Jagat Singh. Under him the state reached her pinnacle.
In 1618, while Dhameri was still ruled by Suraj Mal, Jagat Singh was in charge of a "mansabdar" (Mughal army detachment) in Bengal. The rebellious and fiercely independent attitude of Suraj Mal was a source of constant annoyance to the Mughals and caused their emperor, Jahangir, to exile him to Chamba and place Jagat Singh on the "gaddi'’ (throne).
Jagat Singh exploited his proximity to the Mughals in expanding the boundaries of his state. He ruthlessly pursued the interests of Dhameri and as a result was on bad terms with the neighbouring states of Chamba, Basoli, Guler, Mandi and Suket. His forces conquered Basoli and Chamba and on 6 November 1620 they captured the Kangra Fort.
Soon after the capture of Kangra Fort, Jahangir and Nur Jahan visited Dhameri. To commemorate their visit, Jagat Singh renamed Dhameri as Nurpur. Nur Jahan was so fascinated by the beauty of the place that she ordered construction of a palace for her at Nurpur. This did not appeal to Jagat Singh who considered the palace a hindrance to his newfound freedom. Therefore, to dissuade Nur Jahan, he perpetrated the idea that the place did not have good weather and locals were prone to contracting the disease Goitre. It is believed that Jagat Singh enjoyed a special confidence of Nur Jahan and that, according to the "Tuzk-e-Jahangiri", after his rebellion against the Mughals during 1640-1642, he was not only granted condonation on 10 April 1642 but was also restored the honour of ‘favourite of Mughals’, at her behest.
Jagat Singh was a formidable warrior. He distinguished himself at Kabul by capturing Karim Dadh S/o Jalala Tariki who had rebelled against the Mughals. He assisted Mughal forces in Kandahar and conquered Zamin-i-Dawar and Bust. All this gave him great influence in the Mughal court and he was presented with gifts and honours by the emperor. However, he had different designs in his mind and was restless for total sovereignty.
In 1640, Jagat Singh rebelled against the Mughal domination of Shah Jahan. He had been secretly planning this for considerable time and had fortified three forts of Mau, Nurpur and Taragarh. By December 1641 the Mau fort had fallen to the combined forces of Mughals and rulers of Guler and Chamba. The detailed account of siege of these forts by Mughals exists in ‘"Badshahnamah"’ (Mughal records). Taragarh was the last fort to fall and most fortified. Mughals lost several of their commanders to Jagat Singh's men, including Khusru Beg and Asaf Khan. According to '‘Badshahnamah’', it appears that siege of Taragarh fort commenced in December 1641 (after fall of Mau and Nurpur forts) and was over by April 1642 when Jagat Singh and his sons surrendered on mutually-agreed terms. The Mughals, who were normally ruthless towards rebels and did not even spare their kith and kin, in this instance restored Jagat Singh he and his sons to all their previous status and kingdom. The emperor knew that Jagat Singh could not be brow-beaten and that his services could be of use elsewhere, so perhaps he had agreed for surrender on mutual terms.There was also still a closeness between Jagat Singh and Nur Jahan: he was not only a great warrior but a shrewd politician.
Jagat Singh ruled till 1644 and during his remaining reign rendered assistance to Mughal forces in Khandahar, Kabul. He was immortalized by the poet Gambhir Rai, who wrote of Jagat Singh's exploits four years after he had died:
“"Uthapan, Uthapan Naresh Tu Paithan Path,"
"Jako dae Badshahi panch sath pave,"
"Dandath udandi nokhandat akhandi,"
"Panch Sath dweep kirth, yash ghave,"
"Uthal-Vithal aur udal ujal jath,"
"Sangi gaey suk jath, bhojan na khave,"
"Kaith Gambhir sur spath Ashok Raja,"
"Sanj lo salam karan Khan yahan aave"”
Folklore associated with siege of Taragarh Fort (Revolt against Mughal from 1640 to 1642)
The Taragarh Fort was so well fortified by Jagat Singh and his sons that according to local folklores it took huge Mughal army 12 years (period seems an exaggeration) to annex it. It is said that Mughal forces surrounding the fort had planted Mango saplings which fruited in the course of siege and soldiers enjoyed their fruits (this place near Taragarh fort is to-day called ‘"Amb ka Bagh"’ literally meaning ‘Mango Orchard’). The sons and men of Jagat Singh were forced to eat vermin inside the fort as their rations finished. However, to fool enemy surrounding the fort one day the men of Jagat Singh prepared the "kheer" (milk pudding) from female dog’s milk (which used to feed at surrounding Mughal forces camp but had given litter inside the fort). They then threw this pudding out of fort. Mughal soldiers saw this pudding and reported to the commander of cordoning forces who could not believe his eyes and died of shock. When this news reached the Mughal emperor that despite such a long siege the Raja and his men are still feasting on milk pudding he decided to negotiate with Jagat Singh who eventually opened the gates of Fort on his terms.

Neeti Sastra

Neeti Saara or Neeti Sastra is a popular collection of morals written by Baddena, a Telugu poet. Baddena (1220-1280? AD) is the composer of the most famous Sumathi Satakam as well as Niti Sastra. Complete details about his origin are not known. But, He was believed to be a Chola prince and was called as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Samanta Raju (vassal) under the Kakateeya Rudrama Devi (reign: 1262-1296 AD) during the thirteenth century.
Popular verses from Neeti Sastra.
1. I shall expound Nitisara (essence of maxims on right conduct) compiled from all scriptures, bowing down to Vishnu, the lord of the universe.
2. Listen to the complete essence of dharma (right action) and contemplate on it. “Do not do unto others what one would not like others to do unto oneself”.
3. Do not act without examining the situation carefully; one ought to act only after scrutinizing the situation carefully. Otherwise, one will have to grieve like the brahmani (Brahman woman) who killed the mongoose (1).
4. Man is bound to experience the fruits of his good and bad actions. The karma does not diminish even after billions of days of Brahma (2) unless one experiences fruits of karma.
5. One cannot earn or retain wealth without undergoing suffering. There is suffering in earning wealth as well as in spending it. Is not wealth the home of suffering?
6. Only a learned person can understand the hardship borne by another learned person to earn knowledge just as a barren woman cannot understand the severe pain endured by a pregnant woman.
7. The parents who do not educate a child are his enemies since he is humiliated in an assembly of learned men like a crane among swans.
8. Onion does not lose its smell even if it is planted in a basin of Camphor, tended using musk and watered using the dew from rose petals.
9. A student acquires quarter of knowledge from the teacher, a quarter from self study, a quarter from class mates and the final quarter in course of time.
10. When a girl is getting married, the father of the girl looks for education in the bride groom; the mother for wealth, the kith and kin for family reputation and the girl for beauty.
11. A scorpion has poison in its tail. A bee has poison in its head. Takshaka has poison in its teeth. An evil person has poison in all his limbs.
12. Sky is the strength of birds, water the strength of fish; king the strength of the weak and wailing the strength of babies.
13. Renounce that wife who is quarrelsome, steals money, faithless and speaks ill of her husband, eats before feeding her husband or children and visits others‟ houses, even if she is the mother of ten sons.
14. An ideal wife will have these six virtues – she will be like a counselor in dealing with various situations, like a maid servant in serving her husband, like Goddess Lakshmi in beauty, like the earth in patience, like a mother in giving love and be like a Courtesan in bedroom.
15. Keep aloof from a horse that is drenched in water, mad elephant, bull that is maddened with lust and an uncultured man who is educated.
16. Helping an evil person will cause harm to one even as feeding milk to a snake will only increase its poison.
17. The fruit of giving charity to a knower of Truth (Brahma Jnani) multiplies like an arrow, shot by Arjuna that turns into ten arrows when he takes aim, hundred when he shoots them, thousand on the way and a shower of arrows when they hit the target.
18. Even God does not know about the leaps of a horse, roaring of clouds, minds of women, destiny of man, lack of rain or excess of rain. Then how can a man know these?
19. Attainment of wealth by an incompetent person, knowledge by a man of ignoble descent, a woman by undeserving person, etc. are in vain like the rainfall on a mountain.
20. Win the whole world by truth, sorrow by charity, elders by service and the enemies by archery.
21. Jati (jasmine) among flowers, Vishnu among men, Rambha among women, Kanchi among cities, Ganges among rivers, Rama among kings, Magha among poetic compositions and Kalidasa among poets excel the others.
22. He who gives birth, takes one to the Guru, imparts knowledge, gives food and protects one from fear – these five are equal to father.
23. The wives of teacher, king and elder brother, the mother-in-law and the mother who gave birth – these five are mothers.
24. Keep a distance of 5 hasta3 (cubits) from a vehicle, ten cubits from a horse and 1000 cubits from an elephant. Keep as much away as possible from an evil person.
25. In childhood, a woman is protected by her father, by her husband in her youth and by her sons in her old age. A woman should never be left alone to fend for herself.
26. The snake and the wicked person are both dangerous. The poison of a snake can be neutralized by mantra or medicine while there is no mantra or medicine that can remove the poison of a wicked person.
27. Longevity, deeds, prosperity, knowledge and death of a person are decided even while he is in the mother‟s womb.
28. Ordinary poison is insignificant when compared to the poison of the sin of usurping the property of a Brahmin (one who is virtuous). Poison kills only one person while the sin of usurping the property of a Brahmin destroys three generations (oneself, one‟s children and grand children).
29. Having two wives in spite of being poor, building a house on a road, doing cultivation in two different places, becoming a witness or bail in a lawsuit are the five self-sought misfortunes.
30. Seeing the elephants, snakes and birds in bondage, the eclipse of the sun and the moon and the poverty of the wise men I conclude that destiny is inevitable.
31. Those who are uneducated do not shine even if they are endowed with beauty and youth and are born in renowned families just like kimsuka (4) flowers which are beautiful but odourless.
32. Those who have one wife, three sons, and two ploughs, six cows and a house in the centre of a country are immensely fortunate.
33. Clothing is the prime requisite for decorations, ghee is the foremost requisite for food, virtue is the foremost requisite for women and knowledge is the chief requisite of scholars.
34. Ant-hill, honey in a honey-comb, moon in bright half of the month, wealth of the king and food received by begging, grow gradually.
35. Truth is my mother, knowledge is my father, righteousness is my brother, compassion is my friend, peace is my wife and patience is my son. These six are my kith and kin.
36. The Sun sets daily taking away a part of one's longevity. Knowing this, one should reflect daily what righteous action one has performed.
37. Speaking sweet words to the wicked is like offering a garland of exquisite flowers into the hands of a monkey.
38. Morning Sun, smoke from funeral pyre, coitus with old woman, muddy water and eating curd-rice at night increase ill health day by day.
39. Setting Sun, smoke from Homa (sacrificial pyre), coitus with young woman, pure water and eating milk rice at night increase longevity day by day.
40. One's wealth and properties remain at one's home, sons and relatives take leave at cremation ground. It is one's good and evil actions that accompany oneself after death.
41. Righteousness prevails and not unrighteousness. Truth prevails and not untruth. Patience prevails and not anger. Gods prevail and not demons.
42. Stocking grains, taking care of calves, doing cultivation oneself, serving one's elders – these five habits foster one's family.
43. Treat the child like a prince till the age of 5, like a servant till the age of 15. When the son reaches the age of 16, treat him like a friend.
44. Even a wise man perishes by teaching a fool, contact with evil woman and by resorting to the company of the wicked.
45. Save wealth for difficult times; how can the wealthy have difficulties? If one squanders wealth, one will eventually lose all the accumulated wealth.
46. One's physical body, wealth and other resources are transitory. Death is always at hand. Knowing this, a wise man should strive to do righteous actions.
47. One who plants a holy fig tree, a neem tree, an Indian fig tree, ten tamarind trees; three trees each of pomegranate, wood-apple and Emblic Myrobalan and five trees each of mango and coconut will not suffer Hell.
48. Will Neem ever acquire sweetness even if it is grown on top of a mountain of molasses and watered thousands of times with milk?
49. One who is beneficial is a kinsman though he is a stranger. One who is harmful is an enemy though he is a kinsman. When one is seriously sick, herbs from distant forest are used as medicine.
50. The knowledge confined to books, wealth that is in the custody of others and a son who has gone to foreign countries are useful in name only.
51. Company of wife is as good as the treatment given by ten physicians. Sun is ten times beneficial than the care given by wife. Mother is ten times beneficial compared to the Sun. Yellow Myrobalan is ten times beneficial than the mother.
52. Even a virtuous person perishes due to association with the wicked just as the swans that gave refuge to the crows perished because of the evil deeds committed by the crows.
53. The characteristics of the wicked persons and phlegm are surprisingly similar. Both of these are agitated by sweetness and are pacified by bitterness. (Phlegm is agitated by sweet food and is pacified by bitter food while the wicked person is agitated by sweet words and is pacified by bitter words).
54. Enmity comes to an end by death. Youth ends with pregnancy. Anger comes to an end by bowing down. Pride comes to an end by begging before others.
55. He, who renovates or helps to regain the glory of fallen family, abandoned well or lake, dethroned king, refugee, cows, temples and wise men, attains fourfold merit.
56. Profession of an artist or writer is the highest. That of cultivation and trade is mediocre, that of a servant is the lowest and that of a porter is lower than the lowest.
57. A bee pursues fragrance. Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth pursues a tactful person, water pursues depth. Fate follows intelligence.
58. The following give better results when they are beaten: the wicked, gold, drum, stubborn horse, unchaste woman, sugar-cane, sesamum and uncultured person.
59. I bow down before these six persons – one who gives pure food, one who performs agnihotra (daily fire ritual) everyday, a knower of Vedanta, one who has seen one thousands full moons, one who fasts every month and a chaste woman.
60. Flees desire wounds, kings desire wealth, the wicked persons desire to quarrel and the wise men desire to have peace.
61. The sun stone shines by the mere presence of the Sun. In the same manner, knowledge shines in a disciple by the mere presence of the teacher.
62. One who does not do any charity is in fact a man of renunciation since he leaves behind all his wealth when he dies and goes to the other world empty-handed. I consider the person who does charity as a miser because when he dies he takes with him the fruits of his charity.
63. He is a wise man who sees the wives of others as his mother, the wealth of others like clod of earth and all beings as his own self.
64. Though the blue water lily, lotus, fish and white water lily are born in water, they have different odours.
65. The wealth that is not used for the gods, wise men, relatives or for oneself is destroyed by water, enemy, king and thieves.
66. One, who decides the course of action after intelligent contemplation when confronted with difficult situations, loss of wealth or life threatening incidents, laughs at the lord of death.
67. The fruit of giving cloth in charity is attainment of kingdom; that of footwear is attainment of vehicle; that of Tamboolam (5) is enjoyment of pleasure. One gains all the above by giving food to the poor.
68. The virtue of cuckoo is voice; the virtue of women is chastity; virtue of Brahmin is knowledge and that of ascetics is patience.
69. The following three are the characteristics of a wicked person: lotus like face, speech as cool as sandal wood and a heart burning with fire (of evil thoughts).
70. Just as a coconut tree bears the weight of coconuts on its head and gives nectarine water throughout its life in return for a little water that was given to it during the first year, a saintly person never forgets the help that he had received.
71. Saints live to serve others just as a river flows, the trees bear fruits and the plants grow not for themselves but for others.
72. One should receive knowledge from a Brahmin (wise man), food at the hands of mother, betal leaves (tamboolam) from one's wife and bracelet (recognition) from the king.
73. Moon is cool. Sandal wood is cooler than the moon. The words of virtuous persons are cooler than moon and sandalwood.
74. Elephant shines by the rut (6), sky by rain clouds, woman by character, horse by speed, temple by regular festivals, speech by grammatical correctness, rivers by swan couples, an assembly by the presence of
scholars, a family by virtuous son, earth by king and the three worlds by the Sun.
75. One who is jealous, one who speaks untruth, one who is ungrateful and one who carries enmity for a long time – these four are karmachandalas (7)
76. Protect your fame by giving up life. Life is transitory while fame will exist as long as the moon and the stars exist.
77. One who has received knowledge despises the teacher; one who is married, despises the mother; the woman who has given birth to a child, despises the husband; one who has recovered from disease despises the physician.
78. One who wears fragrant flowers on head, keeps the feet always clean, associates with beautiful women, eats food in small quantities, does not sleep on bare ground and does not have union with women on new moon days regains the wealth that was lost previously.
79. The wicked, if they are educated, start arguing unnecessarily; become arrogant if they are rich; if they become powerful, they start tormenting others. At the same time the virtuous persons utilize education, wealth and power for knowledge, charity and protection of others.
80. The following four are the doors to destruction: doing improper actions, opposing groups of people, quarreling with powerful persons and believing in the words of women.
81. One ought to ask the following questions repeatedly before beginning any new venture: What is the ideal time? Who are my friends? What is the ideal place? What are my income and expense? Who am I? What is my strength?
82. One ought to learn one lesson each from lion and crane, four lessons from domestic fowl, five lessons from crow, six lessons from dog and three lessons from donkey.
83. One ought to learn the following virtue from lion: Once a work is begun, one must put maximum effort to complete it whether that work is big or small.
84. A wise man ought to perform his duties knowing the time, place and strength and also having controlled all the senses like a crane.
85. One ought to learn from dog the virtues of getting up early in the morning, fighting, sharing food with near and dear ones and toiling for one's livelihood.
86. One ought to learn from a crow, five virtues of copulating secretly, valour, stocking food, etc. for bad times, impeccability and not believing in anyone.
87. One ought to learn from a dog six virtues: To eat in large quantities when food is available, to be content with even small quantities of food, to have deep sleep, to awaken easily, devotion to master and valour.
88. One ought to learn from a donkey the virtues of carrying load even when one is tired, not caring about heat and cold and always being content.
89. That person who cultivates these twenty virtues, will attain success in all his ventures.
90. Physicians, astrologers and sorcerers received with respect and offered food by everyone while those who have mastered other science do not get even a glass of water.
91. Knowledge is lost by laziness; women are lost when they are in the custody of others; cultivation fails when the quantity of seeds sown is very less; an army without a commander is lost too.
92. Though the Ketaki creeper is infested with snakes; does not bear fruits; is thorny, crooked (winding) and grows in muddy places and is thus not easily accessible, it is liked by all due to the fragrance of its flower. A single virtue nullifies all defects.
93. Fire is the guru of twice-born (those who undertake Vedic studies); Brahmin is the guru of other castes; Husband is the guru of women; A guest is the guru for everyone.
94. Of what use is nobility of family if a person is illiterate? A learned man is respected by Gods too though he does not belong to a noble family.
95. One can acquire knowledge by serving the guru or by offering sufficient wealth in return for the knowledge or by exchanging one branch of knowledge for another. There is no means other than these three to acquire knowledge.
96. Just as a pot is filled continuously falling water drops, knowledge, dharma (virtue) and wealth too increase gradually if one pursues them persistently.
97. One ought to learn both the art of fighting with weapons and knowledge of various arts and sciences. The former is scorned in old age while the latter is always respected. 
98. Knowledge is like Kamadhenu, the wishfulfilling cow. Knowledge protects one like a mother when one is in foreign lands. Therefore, knowledge is considered as 'hidden wealth'.
99. Knowledge without application is poison; Food undigested is poison; Assembly is poison for the poor; Young woman is poison for an old man.
100. One's friend during foreign journey is knowledge; wife is friend to one who is at home; medicine is the friend of those who are sick; fruit of good deeds is the friend of the departed soul.
101. Knowledge is extolled by everyone; knowledge is considered great everywhere; one can attain everything with the help of knowledge; a wise man is respected everywhere.
102. A king can never be considered equal to a wise man. King is respected only in his kingdom whereas the wise man is respected everywhere.
103. The life of one who is ignorant is meaningless like the tail of a dog which is of no use in hiding the secret parts or in chasing away the flies that bite the dog.
104. A student who serves the guru attains knowledge just as one who digs the earth gets water from the bottom of the earth.
105. One ought to make each day fruitful by studying at a verse or a part of it; one must spend time in studies, meditation and in doing one's duty.
106. The wise men spend their time enjoying literary works, reading or listening to scriptures while the fools waste their time in grief, sleep or quarrel.
107. An only son who is educated and virtuous brings joy to the whole family happy just as a single moon brings light at night.
108. Ambrosia should be obtained even from poison; gold must be taken even if it lies in filth; knowledge has to be received even from a person of lower social status; a woman of beauty and character should be accepted even if she is from a fallen family.
109. One ought to give one's daughter in marriage into a noble family; One's son must be given proper education; One's enemy must be made to grieve and guide one's dear ones on the path of righteousness.
110. What is impossible for those who are competent? Does distance matter to those who are industrious? Which is foreign land for the learned persons? Who is a stranger for those who talk sweetly?
111. One who is free from modesty attains success and happiness in following matters: In acquiring wealth, grains and knowledge, while eating food and doing business deals.
112. The following are the qualities of a student: eyesight similar to that of a crow, concentration similar to that of a crane, light sleep similar to that of a dog, small quantity of food and simple cloths.
113. The fruit of acquiring a kingdom is that everyone will obey one‟s commands; the fruit of austerity is Brahmacharya (celibacy and study of Vedas); the fruit of education is knowledge; the fruit of wealth is enjoyment and charity.
114. Anger is like the lord of death; greed is like the river Vaitarani (which is very difficult to cross over); knowledge is like Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow; contentment is like the Nandana garden (which is in Heaven).
115. Virtues adorn beauty; character adorns family; success in work adorns knowledge; enjoyment adorns wealth.
116. Beauty is in vain if one has no virtues; family reputation is of no value for one who has no character; knowledge that doesn't give success is in vain; wealth that is not used for enjoyment is also in vain.
117. Wake from sleep the 7 persons mentioned below: student, servant, traveler, a hungry person, a person struck with fear, a porter and watchman.

"Left Alone '86" is an album by jazz pianist Mal Waldron and saxophonist Jackie McLean released on the Japanese Paddle Wheel label in 1986. The album is a sequel to Waldron's 1959 recording "Left Alone" which McLean played on the title track.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Ron Wynn awarded the album 4½ stars stating "Although he cannot maintain the same nonstop pace he had in the early '60s, Jackie McLean still plays magnificently. He demonstrated that repeatedly on this 1986 duo date with pianist Mal Waldron, whose lovely countermelodies, complementary solos, darting phrases, and supporting accompaniment proved a perfect contrast to McLean's forays. He is lyrical and engaging on some tracks; his explosive side emerges on others".

We are proud that our school is St.Margaret's, Seria
The place of our studies to fit us for life.
Each morning we study with teachers to guide us.
At home we are busy to learn all they've taught.
We are boys and we are girls with lives stretched out before us.
Oh! what shall we do with this life that is ours?
We'll fit ourselves daily to be useful people;
To serve God and neighbour the rest of our lives.

City of Oakland's Zero Waste Program

The City of Oakland, California, adopted a Zero Waste Strategic Plan in 2006, detailing a road map for the City to follow toward the implementation of a Zero Waste System by 2020. As stated in a City Resolution, introduced by then Mayor Jerry Brown, Zero Waste principles:
Zero Waste systems can be traced back to chemist Paul Palmer who developed and coined the concept in the 1970s (in Oakland, CA) in order to find a way to reuse the vast amount of chemicals produced by the electronics industry. Today, cities like Oakland are adopting Zero Waste Systems to create a process that redirects all end-of-life products toward future applications in the marketplace, rather than to a landfill.
Oakland's Zero Waste Strategic Plan.
The city of Oakland’s Zero Waste Strategic Plan set out in 2006 to reduce the annual tons of waste directed toward landfills from 400,000 tons to 40,000 annually by 2020. Chiefly, the city aimed to create comprehensive systems that transfer end-of-life products back into the economy. The City’s Strategic Plan is based on five strategies that include recycling but also product and system design changes and policy revisions, as follows:
Abiding by the system advocated by Zero Waste International Alliance, Oakland’s Zero Waste System follows “natural cycles, where all outputs are simply an input for another process.” Moreover, Zero Waste systems place the “highest priority on conserving resources and retaining their form and function without burning, burying, or otherwise destroying their form and function. “ This calls for “eliminating discharges to land, water or air that harm natural systems,” as well as, “preventing rather than managing, waste and pollution, and recommitting to the priority ordering of the waste reduction hierarchy: first reduce consumption; next, reuse what is left; and finally, recycle anything that is no longer usable and landfill any residual.”
Oakland’s Zero Waste System also examines each management of goods in accordance with specific criteria, such as:
Motivations.
In 2006, Oakland residents surpassed the state mandate of diverting 50% landfill waste from 580,000 to 400,000 tons, yet progress toward greater waste reduction was slowing down. Meanwhile, consumption of materials and products continued to grow. Widespread evidence indicated that every stage of production, transportation, use and disposal of materials and products negatively impacted ecosystems, the climate, public health and biodiversity. The quantity of toxic materials in the disposal process was increasing and Oakland was struggling to maintain cost effective waste management. 
Oakland’s system of waste reduction in 2006 allowed businesses to determine how their products would be designed and packaged, without regulation. This practice left the consumers and local governments to bear the burden of disposing of material goods. Zero Waste Systems, on the other hand, call for businesses to develop not only recyclable packaging and product designs, but designs that could have endless new uses and applications. The Zero Waste System, therefore, offered Oakland an ambitious strategy to address waste and inefficiencies endemic to the City’s structure, economy and practices.
Causes/sources of excess waste.
We commonly think of waste as garbage, or refuse; anything that becomes useless or a byproduct. In other words, waste has countless physical sources. Zero Waste Alliance (2011) describes waste in this way:
When Oakland adopted its Zero Waste Strategic Plan in 2006, the actual 400,000 tons of waste consisted of the following:
Oakland categorized the source of waste by the individual or group that submitted the waste to the City for disposal in landfills, (1) Non-residential or commercial sources and (2) Residential, including single family or multi-family sources. At the time, 67% of waste was generated by non-residential sources, and residents produced 33%. Of this non-residential group, 30% was being hauled to landfills by entities over which the City had minimal control (those that haul their own garbage to the landfill), such as Cal Trans, AC Transit, BART and independent contractors. Of the 400,000 tons of material transferred to landfills, 67% could be recycled using city operations already established. Regional recovery and diversion options existed in 2006 for paper, glass, metals, plastics, yard trimmings, food, clean wood, concrete, asphalt, and roofing. The City recognized that it could minimize the transfer of these materials with additional focus on improving separation of materials, messaging to businesses regarding diversion and recycling options and stronger incentives.
Social and historical underpinnings.
The need for incentives touches upon the social and historical forces that have led to excessive waste production. As scholars, historians, environmentalists, and even politicians have increasingly asserted, the American economic system has long prioritized economic growth over preserving the natural world. This approach has often put nature at the bottom of our hierarchy of importance. As Porritt contends in Capitalism as if the World Matters, corporations focused on growth have not been held accountable for damages they cause to the environment; which has created very little incentive for industries to concern themselves with sustainability or environmental protection. With profit and growth as the ultimate goal, businesses have sought out the cheapest resources and environments lacking regulation. 
Unfortunately environmental concerns didn’t come to the forefront until the 1970s when Congress passed a series of pro-environment policy changes in response to a wave of environmental passion flaring across the country. Nonetheless, while policies have led to environmental progress in some areas, such as in air quality, governments have had a harder time implementing programs that regulate groundwater contaminants. Meanwhile, landfills continue to contaminate ground and drinking water around the country. 
Indeed, as late as 2006, the City of Oakland offered incentives for businesses to haul garbage to a landfill, rather than consider reuse and recycling options. Additionally, Oakland recognized in 2006 that a lack of service providers for recycling and recovery efforts had prevented progress toward environmentally sustainable solutions. Also, the City had never set aside land needed for reuse and recycling business materials. In this way, incentives and the marketplace were working against the City’s environmental concerns. In fact, most product consumption serves to undermine a Zero Waste Policy because of the inherent negative “externalities,” or those factors outside the market transaction, which are not accounting for in the cost of producing and consuming an item. Historically, prices for toys, watches, cars, etc., have not covered the costs associated with disposing or recycling these items. 
Oakland will remedy this flaw in the system by working toward shifting the responsibility of material disposal to the manufacturer instead of the government or the consumer. Further, rather than apply the tax base toward cleanup of contaminated landfills, the Zero Waste system will use the tax base to invest in recycling, composting and reuse facilities, called “Resource Recovery Parks.”
Evolution of policy.
Oakland’s Zero Waste Policy evolved out of a series of mandates originating with the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which required every city and county in California to reduce their solid waste disposal amounts by 50% by year 2000. Soon after, in 1990, the Alameda County Waste Reduction and Recycling Initiative Charter Amendment (Measure D) mandated a 75% reduction in waste disposal countywide, allowing the Alameda County Source Reduction and Recycling Board to set a deadline for the goal. This board set 2010 as the deadline date. In 2002, the City of Oakland advocated for this goal by adopting a 75% reduction waste goal through Resolution 77500. This resolution called upon the Environmental Service Division of the City of Oakland’s Public Works Agency to identify strategies to accomplish this goal. The City also amended the Oakland Municipal Code to establish requirements for construction and demolition debris waste reduction in 2002 through Ordinance #612253.
Marking another milestone in the evolution toward Zero Waste, San Francisco hosted the United Nations World Environment meeting of 2005, bringing together mayors across the country for a strategy session on waste disposal. Governor Jerry Brown’s Sustainability Director at the time, Randy Hayes, played a pivotal role in Oakland’s participation in the Accords and in creating momentum supporting Zero Waste systems within the Mayor’s office. Brown signed the United Nations World Environment Day Urban Environmental Accords, pledging that Oakland would implement 21 action steps toward sustainability, which included a Zero Waste Goal. This accord meeting and related efforts spurred Oakland in 2006 to adopt a Zero Waste Strategic Plan, calling for 90% reduction in annual tons sent to landfills by 2020.
Policy tools.
What policies are aiding Oakland’s in advancing toward Zero Waste? Oakland’s Zero Waste Economy document, created in 2006, presents a multifaceted approach that incorporates prescriptive regulation, incentive-based or financial payments, penalties, and capacity policy tools directing the City toward a more “environmentally and economically sustainable system where resources are kept in the production cycle”, as described below.
Prescriptive regulations or those that mandate actions allowed by law, also known as “command and control regulation”:
Financial Penalties, or those tools designed to mitigate environmental harm by charging the offending party taxes or fees:
Incentive-based actions or financial payment encourage behavior by subsidizing certain actions or methods:
Persuasion techniques offer soft approaches urging behavior to change by distributing or publicizing information about the environmental issue.
Status in 2011.
Oakland is no longer measuring progress in terms of diversion rates, which allows credits for recycling, population and economic factors, but evaluates waste reduction more ambitiously, in terms of total disposal tonnage. The 90% reduction rate it seeks by 2020 will require Oakland to double the waste reduction it had achieved over the past 15 years. After 2002, when the City adopted the 75% reduction rate goal, Oakland’s Public Works Agency realized that the systems that enabled Oakland to reach a 50% reduction rate would not be sufficient for Oakland to reach a 75% reduction rate. Hence, improving the systems has been a primary focus since 2006, which are outlined in Strategies #2 and #4 of the Strategic Plan. These strategies aim to build an end to incentives to continue disposing in landfills, instead calling for manufacturers to take responsibility for the products and their materials through the entire duration of product life cycles. 
One third of the materials that were winding up at city landfills in 2002 did not have recovery possibilities, leaving landfills as the only option. Much of this had to do with factors outside of the City’s control, for reaching the 75% reduction rate would require changes at the state and/or federal level where manufacturing decisions are made. In fact, within the Zero Waste Strategic Plan, strategies 4 and 5 largely depend on behaviors and regulations outside municipal boundaries. 
This realization led the City toward a stronger advocacy role, beginning when Jerry Brown was governor in 2002. Since that time, Oakland has been working with numerous regulatory and implementing agencies to advance legislation favoring system changes that allow for a Zero Waste goal to be achieved, including (to name a few):
Oakland also worked in a national group to develop a Zero Waste Toolkit designed to aid governments in implementing an Energy & Climate Action Plan (ECAP) for the reduction of greenhouse gases through materials management.
Moreover, while advocating for systemic changes at the state and regional level, the City recognized a need for assistance in implementing system changes at the local level. In 2009, Oakland’s Public Works Agency entered into contract with R3 Consulting for support with system analysis, planning and implementation of Oakland’s Zero Waste Strategic Plan. R3 Consulting was chosen as the most highly experienced agency in system design for municipal governments, having formerly completed projects with the Cities of Dublin, San Jose, Sacramento, and Los Angeles, as well as with StopWaste.org. R3’s work plan was split into two phases with an estimated project end date in 2011, including:
The City of Oakland’s Public Works Agency is named as the primary administrator of the program. 
According to Oakland’s Public Works Agency Web site (April, 2011), Oakland has steadily advanced its progress toward Zero Waste in recent years. Residents have reduced their landfill disposal by 27% since 2000, down to approximately 100,000 tons, bringing the City markedly closer to its goal of minimizing waste to 40,000 tons. 
Oakland residents have played an important role in moving the City toward Zero Waste. Indeed, the “empowered consumer” is critical in the Zero Waste Economy. In our society, all systems circle back to money and sales (Gore, 2006). Using their buying-power, consumers can tell industries that products must be non-toxic, reusable, recyclable or compostable or they will stay on the shelf. Following this directive, manufacturers and products designers will ultimately have no choice but to create or distribute sustainable products that drive the economy toward a paradigm that views production cycles as they do in nature, where “waste” is repurposed in the cycle of life.

<doc id="31119539" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31119539" title="Art of Mesopotamia">
Art of Mesopotamia

The art of Mesopotamia has survived in the archaeological record from early hunter-gatherer societies (10th millennium BC) on to the Bronze Age cultures of the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. These empires were later replaced in the Iron Age by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires. Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia brought significant cultural developments, including the oldest examples of writing.
The art of Mesopotamia rivalled that of Ancient Egypt as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western Eurasia from the 4th millennium BC until the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculptures were also painted.
Before the Assyrians.
The Protoliterate period in Mesopotamia, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals. The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BC, part man and part lion. A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived. Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men.
Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at Ur (c. 2650 BC), including the two figures of a "Ram in a Thicket", the "Copper Bull" and a bull's head on one of the Lyres of Ur. The so-called Standard of Ur actually a box of uncertain function, is finely inlaid with partly figurative designs (British Museum).
From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BCE Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not. The Burney Relief is an unusual elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15 inches) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions. It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BCE, and may also be moulded. Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemmorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them; the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type, and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one.
Assyrian period.
An Assyrian artistic style distinct from that of Babylonian art, which was the dominant contemporary art in Mesopotamia, began to emerge c. 1500 BC and lasted until the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC.
The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone or alabster, and originally painted, for palaces. The precisely delineated reliefs concern royal affairs, chiefly hunting and war making. Predominance is given to animal forms, particularly horses and lions, which are magnificently represented in great detail. Human figures are comparatively rigid and static but are also minutely detailed, as in triumphal scenes of sieges, battles, and individual combat. Among the best known Assyrian reliefs are the lion-hunt alabaster carvings showing Assurnasirpal II (9th century BC) and Assurbanipal (7th century BC), both of which are in the British Museum. Reliefs were also carved into rock faces, as at Shikaft-e Gulgul, a style which the Persians continued.
The Assyrians produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures, usually lions and winged beasts with bearded human heads, often the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete). These marked fortified royal gateways, an architectural form common throughout Asia Minor. Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined. At Nimrud the carved Nimrud ivories and bronze bowls were found that are decorated in the Assyrian style but were produced in several parts of the Near East including many by Phoenician and Aramaean artisans.
The Assyrian form of the winged genie influenced Ancient Greek art, which in its "orientalizing period" added various winged mythological beasts including the Chimera, the Griffin or Pegasus and, in the case of the "winged man", Talos.
Neo-Babylonian period.
The famous Ishtar Gate, part of which is now reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, was the main entrance into Babylon, built in about 575 BC by Nebuchadnezzar II, the king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire who exiled the Jews. The walls surrounding the entrance way are decorated with rows of large relief animals in glazed brick, which has therefore retained its colours. Lions, dragons and bulls are represented. The gate was part of a much larger scheme for a processional way into the city, from which there are sections in many other museums. Large wooden gates throughout the period were strengthened with large metal bands, often decorated with reliefs, several of which have survived.
Other traditional types of art continued to be produced - the Neo-Babylonians were very keen to stress their ancient heritage - and after Mesopotamia fell to the Persian Achaemenid Empire, which had much simpler artistic traditions, Mesopotamian art was, with Ancient Greek art, the main influence on the cosmopolitan Achaemenid style that emerged, and many ancient elements were retained in the area even in the Hellenistic art that succeeded the conquest of the region by Alexander the Great.

Legendaddy

"Legendaddy" is the 19th episode of the sixth season of the CBS sitcom "How I Met Your Mother" and the 131st episode overall. It aired on March 21, 2011.
Plot.
The gang goes to the house that Ted bought in "Home Wreckers". While Ted explains his plans for the house, Barney attempts to persuade Ted to add erotic and sensual objects. It is then revealed that the trip is an intervention. Barney believes it is for Ted, but it is actually for him.
A few days before the intervention, the gang attempted to watch TV in Barney's apartment and they learn that Barney does not know how to use tools, so he has called a repairman to fix the TV. However, instead of the repairman, Barney is greeted by Jerome Whittaker (John Lithgow) at the door; he is Barney's father and has received his letter. Later, Barney related to the gang his meeting with Jerry, telling them how he is a tour manager who loves Scotch, suits, and loose women as much as he does. Though the gang is happy for Barney, they worry that Jerry will hurt him again, which Barney brushes off. However, the gang is later approached by Jerome, who reveals that he is actually a driving instructor with a normal suburban life. During the actual meeting with Barney, Jerry attempted to impress him but failed miserably.
The gang reveals that Barney's intervention is about seeing his father, who lives nearby Ted's house. Barney reluctantly agrees to have dinner with Jerome's family and meets Jerry's wife, Cheryl, and his son JJ. Barney acts antagonistically toward JJ, but stops when he learns that JJ stands for Jerome Junior. Upset, Barney abruptly leaves and Jerome follows him to the garage, where Barney is attempting to steal the basketball hoop attached to it. When Barney expresses his resentment that Jerry is nothing more than a "lame suburban dad" and that JJ got to have a normal childhood while he did not, Jerry apologizes for abandoning Barney and helps him remove the hoop while teaching him how to use a screwdriver. Barney leaves with the basketball hoop and tells Ted that he should have it for his future kids, choking up as he says, "a kid needs a hoop."
Meanwhile, the gang begins to note all of the things that each of them never bothered to learn, noticing it when Barney mentions he doesn't know how to use a screwdriver. Robin points out Ted's odd pronunciation of the word "chameleon." Ted points out that Robin is unaware that the North Pole is a real place (and later she does not know that reindeer are real (despite being Canadian, where reindeer are found practically everywhere) or that Jack Kennedy and John F. Kennedy are the same person). Ted also points out Lily's bad throwing skills. Marshall is the only one whom the gang does not mention, and he eventually "asks" the gang to pick on him. He reveals that he is aware that the gang has been careful around him ever since his father died, and says that he just wants to feel normal again. The group does resume picking on Marshall, mocking his inability to wink or swallow pills, his tendency to add too much water to his oatmeal, how he always misses one belt loop and how he is too old to ask to see the cockpit on planes. Marshall thanks them, grateful to be treated like an equal again.
Barney's blog.
Barney discusses how a father and son can become wingmen, revealing a list of plays that they can do.
Music.
"I Will Come for You" - Jack Dolgen.
Production.
Co-executive producer Craig Thomas said the issue about the identity of Barney's real father was already a plot point in the initial conceptualization of the series. John Lithgow was the first choice to play Jerome Whittaker and the producers gave him a collection of specific episodes detailing Barney's father issues (including "Showdown") to help him get acquainted with the role. Thomas said Lithgow will still appear in future episodes, as the role would complicate Barney's connection with Nora.
Reception.
Donna Bowman of the AV Club gave the episode a B.
Zach Oat of Television Without Pity graded the episode at B+
Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8 out of 10.
A number of reviews also praised Harris' emotional scene with Lithgow.

Live House

Live House is a 2009 documentary film directed by Kevin McGue. The film includes interviews with Minutemen founder Mike Watt, Red Bacteria Vacuum, and other Japanese underground bands.
The documentary explores the underground rock music scene in Japan, in which bands play at venues called "live houses," which differ from live music venues in other countries. According to live house owners and bands interviewed in the film, a live house is different from bars in America that invite bands to play and charge a cover, as customers at a live house come primarily to enjoy music rather than drink alcohol.
Mike Watt, interviewed for the film during a tour of Japan, talks of first coming to Japan when playing bass for J. Mascis and Iggy Pop during stadium tours, but became interested in the country's underground music scene and returning to tour in much smaller venues.

Iconoclast (Symphony X album)

Iconoclast is the eighth album by American progressive metal band Symphony X. 
It was released on June 17, 2011, in Europe, June 21, 2011, in the United States and on June 28, 2011, in Canada.
Theme.
When interviewed, vocalist Russell Allen said that the lyrical concept of the album is based on "the idea of machines taking over everything, and all this technology we put our society into pretty much being our demise." Allen said on Heavy Metal Thunder that "it isn't a story, but rather a theme, like "Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd."
Album art.
Illustrator and film concept artist Warren Flanagan ("Watchmen", "The Incredible Hulk", "2012"), who designed the cover of "Paradise Lost", returned as art director for "Iconoclast". Sharing his creative process on the album's artwork: "The idea was to create imagery that was a little darker in tone to previous Symphony X albums and to represent the overall theme of Iconoclast into the artwork. The whole concept came from Mike , who had a strong idea of what the cover should represent based on the music. I just ran with it. When the album's title was decided on, I focused the image based on the meaning of it. I also wanted to use the band's signature 'masks' but present them in a way that connected to the new album."
Track listing.
Iconoclast is available as a single disc as well as a special edition digipak with five extra tracks, three additional and two alternative versions from disc one. Guitarist Michael Romeo has stated that the special edition contains the track order that the band originally intended to release, but their label (Nuclear Blast) wanted a single-disc version as well. According to Romeo, the track "Reign In Madness" is the proper closing to the album.
Reception.
"Iconoclast" debuted at number 76 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States, selling more than 7,300 copies in its first week. The record also debuted at number 7 on the Top Hard Rock Chart, number 19 on the Top Rock Chart and number 13 on the Top Independent Chart. The album showcases the highest chart position and the most first-week sales in the band's history.

John Graham Dalyell

Sir John Graham Dalyell (1775-1851) was a Scottish antiquary and naturalist
Life.
The second son of Sir Robert Dalyell, fourth baronet, who died in 1791, by Elizabeth, only daughter of Nicol Graham of Gartmore, Perthshire, was born at Binns, Linlithgowshire, in August 1775. When an infant he fell from a table upon a stone floor and became lame for life. He attended classes first at St. Andrews, and secondly at the University of Edinburgh, and while there qualified himself for the Scotch bar, and became a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1796. The work in the parliament-house proved to be too fatiguing for him, but he acquired a considerable business as a consulting advocate, and although a younger son and not wealthy he made it a rule of his legal practice not to accept a fee from a relative, a widow, or an orphan. In 1797 he was elected a member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and was chosen the first vice-president of that society; he also became a member of the Society of Arts for Scotland, and served as president 1839-40.
Devoting himself to letters with an enthusiasm which animated him to the last, he soon turned his attention to the manuscript treasures of the Advocates' Library, and in 1798 produced his first work, "Fragments of Scottish History," which contained, among other matter of interest, "The Diary of Robert Birrell, burgess of Edinburgh from 1532 to 1608." This was followed in 1801 by "Scottish Poems of the Sixteenth Century," in 2 vols. In the preface to this work the author says that in the course of his preparatory researches he had examined about seven hundred volumes of manuscripts. In addition to his knowledge of antiquarian lore he had also an extensive acquaintance with natural history, and in 1814 gave to the public his very valuable "Observations on several Species of Planariæ, illustrated by coloured figures of living animals." On 22 August 1836 he was created a knight by letters patent, and on 1 February 1841 succeeded his brother, Sir James Dalyell, as sixth baronet of Binns. "Rare and Remarkable Animals of Scotland, with practical observations on their nature," he finished in 2 vols, in 1847. The publication of this beautifully engraved work was unfortunately delayed for nearly five years, owing to a dispute and a law process with the engraver, and the delay deprived Dalyell of the full credit of several of his discoveries in connection with medusae.
The first volume of his last and great work, "The Powers of the Creator displayed in the Creation, or Observations on Life amidst the various forms of the humbler Tribes of Animated Nature," was published in 1861. The second volume, after the author's death, was brought out in 1853, under the superintendence of his sister, Miss Elizabeth Dalyell, and Professor John Fleming, D.D., while the third volume was delayed until 1858. Dalyell became an enrolled member of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland in 1807, and in 1817 was presented by his fellow members with a piece of plate for the invention of "a self-regulating calendar". He was one of the original promoters of the Zoological Gardens of Edinburgh and 'preses' of the board of directors in 1841. He died at 14 Great King Street, Edinburgh, 7 June 1851, and was buried beside his ancestors in Abercorn Church. He was never married, and his successor in the baronetcy was his brother, Sir William Cunningham Cavendish Dalyell.
Works.
Besides the publications already mentioned Sir John Dalyell was the author, editor, or translator of the following works;
Sir John was also a contributor to the "Philosophical Journal," "Reports of the British Association," "New Philosophical Journal," "Encyclopaedia Britannica," Douglas's "Peerage," and Burke's "Baronetage."

Dobele State Gymnasium

Dobele State Gymnasium ("Dobeles Valsts ģimnāzija") is a gymnasium (school) in Dobele, (Latvia), founded in 1922. The official language of the school is Latvian, and students can also study English, Russian, and German. Students in grades 10 - 12 concentrate on either Mathematics and Science, Humanities, or Business and Commerce.
History.
The Dobele city council, supported by Ministry of Education, decided to open a gymnasium (academically rigorous high school) in Dobele on January 7, 1921. Dobele city gymnasium was established one year later, on March 15, 1922. The first class began with 17 students—10 girls and 7 boys. The school became a cultural sanctuary known throughout the county. 
In September 26, 2003, Dobele city gymnasium was granted a status change from "Dobele city gymnasium” to‘’ Dobele State gymnasium’’ (Dobeles Valsts ģimnāzija or DVG) by the Latvian president Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. 
The gymnasium has collaborated with several institutions abroad. In the autumn of 2001, for example, the Latvian Academy of Business and Management and an economics educational organization implemented a commerce program for Dobele students.
The school participates in the AFS inter-cultural exchange program and DVG students have studied abroad in many countries around the world, including Denmark, the US, and Scotland. DVG has also received exchange students from Australia, Germany, Austria, Thailand, Brazil, and France.
In 2006-2007 the school began a project to highlight teacher’s educational process. The project was initiated by teacher L. Čebaņenko, who matriculated two 10th grade classes in a single year. Initially the project was supported by the EU, but after two years it was transferred to the Dobele city council. In the same year, the school was one of 50 schools in Latvia to receive approval for a science program with an emphasis on student research and lab work.
DVG students have earned awards in educational competitions at the district, county, republic, and world levels.
School traditions.
DVG has passed down many traditions through the years. Some of these include Knowledge Day, Sports Day, Adaptation Day, Teacher’s Day, a Christmas concert, a St. Valentines ball party, a Spring concert, Environment Day, and School Council sports tournaments including basketball, volleyball, and ice hockey.

Gross loan

Gross loan is the total amount of issued credits given to banks during the accounting period. Liquidity of the bank can be judged upon the amount of its gross loans. Liquidity of the credit institutions is directly related to the refinancing needs.
Gross loan is the total amount of loans, refinanced by credit institutions subject to the Central Bank. The Central Bank, as the lender of last resort, provides loans (credits) to commercial banks and other credit institutions, when the banks themselves have completely depleted their internal resources and are unable to maintain their solvency through other means. The Central Bank gives loans to commercial banks at the refinancing interest rate, which is minimal and may vary, depending on the type of services the given bank provides.

Parti PRO des Lavallois

The Parti PRO des Lavallois, formerly known as the Parti Ralliement Officiel des Lavallois (PRO Laval), is a defunct municipal political party in Laval, Quebec. It was formerly led by Gilles Vaillancourt, the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012.
The Parti PRO was founded in the early 1980s by a group of councillors who resigned from the city's governing alliance. It was originally progressive but later shifted to a more pro-business position. Party co-founder Ronald Bussey resigned from the group in 1984, charging that it had become dominated by businessmen and former opponents.
The Parti PRO, the dominant municipal party in Laval for several years, has won every council seat in each municipal election since 2001.
Following Vaillancourt's resignation as a result of corruption allegations made at the provincial Charbonneau Commission, the party voted to dissolve on November 19, 2012. Its councillors will continue to sit as independents.

Green printing

Green printing is described as the movement in the printing industry wherein recycling, reusing, and reducing are done to lower the number of resources used for printing and advertising.
This method involves the use of low-VCO (Volatile Organic Chemical) inks, recycled paper, energy-efficient computers and equipment, remanufactured laser toner cartridges and ink cartridges for printers, paperless information dissemination, attempts to educate the public on green printing.
Benefits.
Green printing has a lot to offer for the environment and for the savings on printing costs as well. When fully accomplished in an office or even at home, the expenses can be cut by up to 70% or more depending on the strategies applied.
When it comes to environmental concerns, green printing can help in conservation and preservation. On the use of recycled paper, the paper manufacturing industry has been quite active in seeking ways of producing their products without having to process pulps that are acquired from trees. This simply means that the thousand or more pounds of solid waste left when producing non-recycled paper could be reduced, allowing trees to live longer and become stronger for another set of years. Another good example of green printing strategy is the production of remanufactured printer cartridges, which are made up of recycled cartridges that have been inspected and tested before selling. These printer supplies reduce the number of resources used when creating OEMs, which helps preserve nature. Up to 97% of remanufactured cartridges are recyclable cutting the number of waste dumped each day.
There are a lot of things that can be done to make everyday printing greener. When it comes to paper or material used for printing, paper made out of post-consumer waste, processed chlorine free, uncoated, or treeless can be a good option to replace standard paper. These types of paper are made through advanced technology that studies have shown to have little or no effect on the environment.
Since printing also involves supplies such as laser toners and ink cartridges, the use of remanufactured types can be of great help in trying green printing techniques. Third party printer supply stores that manufacture these items assure their customers of high quality and eco-friendly printing at an affordable price. Remanufactured products also undergo several tests to ensure that these items will perform at their best without harming the environment.
Common Issues.
There are a lot of misconceptions about green printing that still leave companies hesitant in trying, like the belief that recycled papers and remanufactured printer cartridges only create low quality prints. This has long been the subject of debate, but the manufacturers of such products have actively informed the public that applying recyclable materials for printing can provide the same high quality output that they get from the usual supplies. The only difference is the cost of recycled products, since they are usually cheaper, despite being more environmentally responsible than more traditionally produced products.

Urkiola Natural Park

Urkiola Natural Park is a protected area located in the southeastern corner of Biscay and Álava in the northern Basque Country, Spain. It is a protected area of .
It was declared a Natural Park on 29 December 1989.
The Park's highest mountain summit is Amboto at . This mountain has a strong mythological significance. Is the main dwelling of Mari, a figure of Basque mythology. Urkiola Natural Park and Gorbea Natural Park form an important environmental unit. Landscape features and easy access have been fundamental to leisure and sports use.
Description and access.
Urkiola Natural Park covers an area of and has a perimeter of . The Natural Park is located in eight municipalities, seven in Biscay and one in Álava.
Landscape.
The landscape of Urkiola Park consists of limestone masses. These rocks have steep slopes, with gullies and cliffs. Karst plains support a diverse and rugged landscape consisting of different proportions of shrubs, grasses, rocks, beech and pine forests. 
Mining activity is important in the park and its vicinity. While mineral extraction has been a traditional activity within the land that makes up the Urkiola Natural Park, the mines were closed long ago. LImestone quarries, opencast mines that have a great impact on the landscape, have remained active since the formation of Urkiola Natural Park.
Geology.
The abundance of limestone and rainfall in the area has led to a very rich karstic relief, with many caves with prehistoric remains of human occupation, sinkholes and fissures.
Climate.
The climate is warm oceanic, with high rainfall with a clear decrease in the summer. Most of the park is about above sea level. The annual rainfall is around . The temperature is mild, with a marine influence, and a range between mean minimum and maximum average , with an annual average of .

Vegetation.
The vegetation of Urkiola Natural Park presents typical features of the Cantabrian-Atlantic provinces of the Euro-Siberian region, with features of the Mediterranean region. The vegetation is:
Flora.
The park's vegetation has been influenced by human exploitation through centuries of occupation. Obviously the height and geology also determine the type of vegetation. Have cataloged a total of 694 taxa (species, subspecies and hybrids), among which 156 are classified as being of special interest because of their special endemism. In the Urkiola Natural Park there aren't own unique species.
Fauna.
The fauna of Urkiola Natural Park consists mainly of typical Euro-Siberian species. Others are Mediterranean origin, Ethiopian Eastern and cosmopolitan. The distribution is the following:
126 species of vertebrates have been catalogued, excluding Chiroptera (bats), The following table shows the distribution according to their class:
In the park are a number of protected species, 64 are included in the "National Catalogue of Endangered Species". There are three species can be caught and 12 that can be hunted.
The Birds Directive of the European Community protects 19 species while the Habitats Directive protects the other 15. There are 106 species that are protected by the Berne Convention, 30 for the Bonn Convention and 15 by the Washington Convention. The "Basque Catalogue of Threatened Species" includes 36 species that are present in the park.
The history of human occupation.
Urkiola Natural Park contains traces of human occupation since prehistoric times. The caves in the gorge of Atxarte, in the massif of Anboto attest to this. Some ceramic fragments from the Roman Empire and Middle Ages are to be found in the remains of walls in the park.
Uses of resources in the park.
Logging.
Logging in Urkiola Natural Park has taken place since time immemorial, in particular beech pollard used for making charcoal, and oaks used for firewood, and pine plantations for the production of paper pulp.
Between 1990 and 2006 of forest have been planted in different species, including of hardwood, mainly beech, birch and oak, and of conifers, primarily Douglas fir, radiata pine, larch and Sitka spruce.
Agricultural and livestock activities.
Livestock and pastoral activity has actively contributed to the formation of the current landscape of the park.
Livestock primarily consists of sheep, cattle and horses. The sheep are for producing milk for cheese and curds. The cattle and horses are raised for meat.
Hunting and Fishing.
Hunting and fishing activities have little relevance within the Urkiola Natural Park. Around the park hunting is provided in some specific areas where it is mainly for migratory species like woodcock, dove and thrush.
Hunted species include hares, which maintain a high population, and there is some wild boar, deer and partridge.
Fishing is non-existent within the Park area.

George Young Blair

George Young Blair (1826 Drumrauch near Dundee – Drumrauch Hall 22 September 1894) was a Scottish marine engineer, who specialised in the building of triple expansion engines at his factory "Blair & Co., Ltd." in Stockton-on-Tees.
Business life.
In 1855 George Blair was appointed manager of Fossick & Hackworth, becoming a partner in 1865. The firm was renamed Fossick, Blair & Co. on Hackworth's retirement, and when Fossick died in 1866 it became Blair & Co.
Blair's management led to the firm's specialising in marine engines. The 700 employees grew to 2 000, and the works covered seven and a half acres. Blair produced the first compound steam engine built on the Tees in January 1869 and fitted it to the "Glenmore" built by Backhouse & Dixon. This was followed in 1884 by its first triple-expansion engine, fitted to the "Burgos" which had been built by Richardson, Duck and Company. 
In 1887 Blair constructed massive sheerlegs next to the Tees. These were capable of lifting 100 tons of marine engine into new ships. By 1914 the yard had turned out some 1 400 marine engines, followed by 75 during World War I. After the War the firm was taken over by Gould Steamships and Industrials in 1919.
Personal life.
George Young Blair was born at Drumrauch Farm, Pittenweem, Anstruther, Fife, Scotland, and married Margaret Borrie (1836–1888), daughter of Peter Borrie and Jean Simson, on 4 September 1862 at St. Hilda's Church, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, North Riding, England.
He constructed the family home, Drumrauch Hall, and bought Linden Grove, also at Hutton Rudby in Yorkshire. In 1862 his residence was at 149 High Street, Stockton-on-Tees. He acted as Justice of the Peace for County Durham.

Angermünde station

Angermünde station is a transportation hub in the city of Angermünde in the northeast of the German state of Brandenburg. The station opened on 15 November 1842 on the Stettin Railway between Berlin and Szczecin and is the starting point of the Angermünde-Stralsund line to Stralsund, the Angermünde-Schwedt line to Schwedt and a disused branch line to Bad Freienwalde.
History.
The station was opened on 15 November 1842 by the Berlin-Stettin Railway Company (, BStE) with the line from Berlin. On 15 August 1843, the extension to Szczecin (then part of Prussia and called "Stettin" in German) was opened. In the following years the station grew into a major junction with the opening of lines to Stralsund (1863), Schwedt (1873) and Bad Freienwalde (1877). In 1879, the BStE was nationalised as part of the Prussian state railways. The station was originally built on an “island” surrounded by tracks (known as an "Inselbahnhof" in German). In 1906, the tracks were redesigned and all the tracks were moved to the west side of the building. In 1861 the original station building was replaced by a new building. The old building later served as a post office and a police station, but it is now unused. As a result of numerous changes to the building during the period of East Germany (1945–1990) the old building has disappeared. The station complex is a listed building.
Train services.
Angermünde station is west of central Angermünde. The station building is east of the tracks. The station has two island platforms with four tracks for passenger traffic. At the northern end of the western platform, there is an additional terminal track. Freight facilities are close to the northern end of the passenger station. The line to Schwedt branches directly in the platform area from the other tracks so that only tracks 1 and 2 can be used by trains to and from Schwedt.
The station is served by the following service(s):

Park of Armentia

The park of Armentia, commonly known as "El bosque de Armentia", is a gall-oak forest located between Vitoria-Gasteiz and the Mountains of Vitoria, in the province of Álava and of the autonomous community of the Basque Country in northern Spain. It has a surface area of 165 has and it is one of the main biological areas in the surroundings because it has a variety of flora and fauna.
Biodiversity.
The Park of Armentia stands out due to the vast area of natural trees it includes, over the 70% of the whole surface. This significant forest mass has been enlarged in the last 25 years, including a great variety of trees which broaden and enrich the park.
Fauna.
The different environments that exist in the park are home to a rich and varied fauna including wild boars, squirrels, birds of prey and even about 30 species of small birds such as goldfinches, chaffinches, robins and great tits. Specially birds are the most of the residents of the forest, among many others, goshawks and falcons.
Flora.
The forest of Armentia contains a number of different environments. There are areas of thick vegetation in which, in addition to gall oaks, there are maples, hawthorns, blackthorns and blackberry bushes, followed by areas of more scattered woodland with large clearings in some places, in which heather, badassi and juniper grow. Another thing worth mentioning is that many beginner biologist come and pick the leaves of the different trees, due to the large variety.
The Artetxo sitting area contains a number of outstanding examples of mature gall oaks with a curious "candelabra-like" shape, a consequence of pruning done over a number of years for firewood. On the ridges beech, holly and rowan can be found and along the edges of the small streams that flow through the Park, maple, hazel and ash are very common too.
Places of historical interest.
The village of Armentia was the most important religious centre in the Middle Ages. Since it was the see of the Bishop, the cathedral of Armentia was the only cathedral in the Basque Country until the 11th century. Armentia was placed at a strategic point at that time. On the one hand it stood on the route of the El Camino de Santiago and on the other hand it stood on the Roman roads.
Basilica of San Prudencio.
The Basilica of San Prudencio is a small church set on a terrace at the entrance of the forest. It dates from the 12th century, possibly at the same time as the birth of Vitoria and it was built in a Romanesque style. Originally this building was dedicated to Saint Andrew, and reconstructed from the remains of an 8th century. It underwent a refubishment, and parts of the inner structure were modified,though it retained its apse and other isolated elements such as its original door.
The church was built with a Latin cross layout, the vaults over the apse and crossing of its two arms are of special interest. The bases of the arches of the second of these vaults contain sculptures of the evangelists. The capitals of the church are decorated with plant and animal motifs, as well as war scenes between landers and centaurs. The atrium maintains some of the remains of the original doorway. After being dismantled, stones from the doorway were embedded in the walls in a disorderly fashion: the tympanum of the Lamb and that of Christ with the Apostles and the bas-reliefs of the Descent of Christ into Hell and the Sepulchre of Jesus, represent one of the best Romanesque sculptural groups in the Basque Country.
Further projects.
Armentia is part of the Green Belt of Vitoria-Gasteiz, together with Salburua, Olarizu, Alegria, Zabalgana, Errekaleor and Zadorra.
The last two decades.
Due to the numerous fires and erosions of land in the forest, the park of Armentia experienced a very precarious state of conservation. The Provincial Council of Alava decided to restore and to renew the forest, introducing new species of plants, in order to improve the park. The maples, rowan trees, cypresses and many other species date from that period.
In the 90-s, the forest went through several bonfires and degradation because of accumulation of rubbish, excessive number of pathways and tracks and numerous eroded and flooded areas.
After joining up the Green Belt, the first work consisted of restructuring the network of paths, improving the main tracks and closing the smaller ones, and the creation of a network of pathways for pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders. The areas where the degradation had left marks were considerably restored, by introducing car parks on the entrances to the park. Finally, two main sitting places were created.

Lakuarriaga Station

Fifteen years ago, the old bus station of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain was demolished. Then some years later, Artium Museum was built in the place where the old bus station had been built. After demolishing the old bus station, a new one was built in Los Herran street. However, the current bus station in Vitoria, the one in Los Herran street, is just working temporarily, because in May 2011 the construction of the new bus station was going to be held. Some months ago, the town hall organized a competition in which the participants, take in account some requirements, were asked to design an intermodal bus station in Vitoria. Eight companies presented their jobs, and the town hall decided that the project designed by Fernando Ruiz de Ocenda, Iñaki Usandizaga and Francisco Javier Garcia de Acilu (in contribution with trakteplan engineries) was the most appropriate.
Purpose.
The new bus station, which later will be part of an intermodal station, is going to be constructed in Arriaga park. This construction, is going to occupy 30% of the whole park, 13,639 meters of its totality of extension. It is going to be located on the corner of the southwest part of the park, next to America Latina roundabout, and giving its face to Honduras street.
It is said that this new building is going to create more than a hundred jobs during its construction, and 3500 more after being constructed, so as to make it work properly. Due to this fact, it is expected that the unemployment in Vitoria will go down noticeably. When the project was designed, the whole construction and the brought to operation was expected to cost 15 million euros. However, lately the budget has increased to 18.5 million euros due to the improvement of the project.
Besides, a new underground car park is going to be built which will benefit the people who live in that neighbourhood and also the travellers. This bus station, will also have some elements which will absorb energy from the sun. These elements will create the 50% of the energy which the station will need to work. The designers of the project, have also decided to put a monolith made of copper which will be a symbol of the intermodal station and which will also function as the support of a screen which will show the timetable of the buses and trains. This monolith, will be located on the intersection between Portal de Foronda and Juan de Garay.
Distribution.
The new bus station, will be a two-storey building which will have a basement too:
Ground floor.
Service buildings (2,042 m2)
Docks (9,222 m2)
First floor.
Service buildings(1,454 m2)
Second floor.
Local services and equipment(495.20 m2)
Basement.
Service buildings
2 other projects.
Some years ago, everybody knew that Vitoria needed a new bus station, since the current one was not at all comfortable and had very few docks. That is why, the town hall decided some months ago to organize a competition in which the participants would be asked to design the new bus station from Vitoria. The town hall chose the three best projects and decided which one was the most appropriate and which fitted more with the city. These chosen projects had been designed by Trakteplan, GLM Unigest and Mozas&Aguirre architect companies. The chosen project, was the one designed by Trakteplan firm and it has been described in the introduction. However, the other two projects were quite interesting too.
GLM Unigest's project.
This project, is based on a semi-underground structure. Thanks to this semi-underground structure, the bus station would not have so much impact on Arriaga park. The project also consists on a semi-underground terminal with an organic design of the facade which tries to be integrated on the park. Due to the semi-underground structure, the docks would have natural light and would be properly ventilated. Furthermore, the station would have three travelators (mechanic stairs) and two lifts. This project consists on 21 docks and thanks to its easy access, 3400 passengers would arrive and leave per hour.
GLM Unigest, proposed two different options for the cover of the docks. One of the proposals was to build a small car park with 73 parking spaces. This car park could just be used 15 minutes and just by the people which were using the bus station or going to pick someone up from the station. The other option, was to put a garden on the cover so that the station would not have such a big impact on the park and people would have the option of wandering around there.
This project totally fits with the budget of 18.5 million Euro that the town hall proposed. Besides, due to its small impact on the park, it has been one of the projects that most of the residents of Lakua have defended.
Mozas-Aguirre's project.
This project also has a semi-underground structure. However, in case of being located on Arriaga park, it is located beside it, on the median strip of Portal de Foronda street. Although it does not affect the park, it has many drawbacks that complicate the traffic on that area. Because this project locates the station where a tramline is located, the tramline would have to be moved and the budget would increase. Moreover, the traffic of the buses would be more difficult. Besides, the connection with the railway station would be longer and would be more difficult. Nevertheless, this project has totally been defended by the residents of Lakua since it has no effects on the park.
To sum up, this project would be a very good option, if the problem of traffic could be resolved.
Critics against the chosen project.
The construction of this new station, has created lots of arguments and problems. Because the station is going to be built in the southwest corner of the park, a lot of residents of the neighbourhood have complained about it. The main point of the argument, was that the %30 of the park was going to disappear because of this construction. It is true that the town hall said that some of the trees which were affected by the construction (104 from 348 which are going to be cut) would be planted during and after the construction. However, as most of the residents of the neighbourhood have seen, three of the trees planted, have died and the other 10 are in a very bad quality.
It has also been said, that the chosen project, is the project that affects more to the park. Mozas&Aguirre company, though, designed a project which did not affect the park at all. Nevertheless, this project has not been chosen because it does not respect the requirements imposed for designing the station. This project, does not locate the station on the park, so it has no effects on the park and neither on the environment. Although most of the residents from the neighbourhood defended this project, the construction would create a very big problem with traffic which would have to be sorted out.
As the well-informed people say, with the construction of the bus station, 16.000 m2 (taking in account the caravan park located on Arriaga park too) of the whole park would be occupied. Afterwards, with the construction of the railway station, another 14.000 m2 would be occupied. Taking in account this piece of information, more than the 97% of the residents from that area are totally against this construction. Furthermore, the residents of the area are against the chosen project, because the town hall has not even studied other alternatives and has decided to build the bus station there, without taking anybody's opinion in account.
The park, was created in 1979 and it is the biggest park in Vitoria because it occupies 176,400 m2. That is why it is considered one of the lunges of Vitoria. Furthermore, it contains more than 150 botanical species. This park is used everyday for jogging, doing sport or just wandering around it. Because of all these pieces of information, most of the people who live on that area, are against the chosen project, because this great urban lung is part of Vitoria, and even more important, it is part of ourselves.
Sustainability.
The town hall has stated that the main disadvantage of the station, is the effect it has on the environmet and specially on the park. Due to this fact, the town hall has tried to deter the park as less practical. That is why the town hall has located the station on a place where its drawbacks are less than in other part of the park. The station will be located on the current caravan park in Arriaga park and thanks to this, fewer trees will be affected and cut down. Furthermore, the designers of the project have put some solar cells and geothermal cells to get renewable energy in order not to affect so much the environment. These cells will create 50% of all the energy needed for making everything work.
Reasons for the station not to be built.
Most of the residents of Lakuarriaga are against this project because it has many drawbacks, and there are many reasons why it would not have to be built:

Aphrodisias of Cilicia

Aphrodisias of Cilicia is the name given to the ruins of an ancient port city in Mersin Province, Turkey.
Geography.
Aphrodisias is situated on Cape Tisan near the town of Yeşilovacık in the rural area of Silifke district which itself is a part of Mersin Province. The ancient name of this region was Cilicia Trachea ("rugged Cilicia") So it is customary to call the ruins Aphrodisias of Cilicia to distinguish it from the better known Aphrodisias in Aydin Province. The ruins are at the east side of the cape facing Dana Island and Güvercinlik Island. The coordinates of the ruins are The highway distance to is Silifke and to Mersin is .
History.
The foundation date of the ancient settlement is unknown. But it was a port of Ptolemaic Egypt in the fourth century BC. The settlement was incorporated into Roman Empire and in the marine book "Ps.Skylax" written in 101 AD, the settlement was named "Cap Aphrodisias ". During the early Middle Ages when the port was a part of Byzantine Empire, it was named "Porto Cavaliere". Then it faded away. The location of the long forgotten ruins was discovered by Austrian Archaeologist Rudolf Heberdey in 1891.
The ruins.
There are ruins of a necropol, a cistern, city walls and floor mosaics of a 4th-century church named "St.Panteleon" (The church was a temple prior to Christianity) . In 1987, Ludwig Budde from Germany published his book "St.Pantaleon von Aphrodisias in Kılikien" about the church. But most of the mosaics are not unearthed yet.

2011 Faisalabad bombing

The 2011 Faisalabad bombing occurred on 8 March 2011. At least 25 people were killed and over 127 wounded when a car bomb blast occurred in a compressed natural gas station in the Pakistani city of Faisalabad. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the explosion.
Background.
Faisalabad is the fourth-largest city in the country and an important industrial hub of the Punjab province; the attack was the first of its kind in the area, which usually remained safe from terrorist incidents. Faisalabad is the home of Pakistani textile industry. Pro-Taliban militant groups had been gaining strength in the area, which had previously witnessed sectarian violence.
Attack.
The car bomb went off at about 10:30 am and left a 7-foot deep by 15-foot wide crater. According to local officials a Toyota Corolla packed with 40 kilograms of explosives was used in the attack.
The vicinity in which the attack took place was said to be a sensitive area and surrounded by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and military offices. A Pakistan International Airlines building and an ISI building were damaged in the bombing. The bomb caused several gas cylinders to explode and damaged several vehicles and buildings.
The station was reduced to a pile of bricks and twisted metal. Rescue officials used heavy machinery and cranes to remove rubble from the scene to search for survivors. Among the dead were an ISI officer and a school teacher.
Responsibility.
A spokesman for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan stated that the bombing, which targeted an ISI building, was in retaliation for the killing of Omar Kundi, a Taliban commander, by special forces in Faisalabad in 2010.

Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Pondicherry

Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (), situated on the south boulevard of Pondicherry in Puducherry, India, is an oriental specimen of Gothic architecture. It contains rare stained glass panels depicting events from the life of Christ and saints of the Catholic Church. In recent years it has become one of the famous pilgrimage spots for Christians.
History.
In the year 1895, the then Archbishop Mgr.Gandhi consecrated the Archdiocese of Pondicherry to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. He wished to build a new church in devotion of Sacred Heart of Jesus. Rev.Fr. Telesphore Welter, the parish priest of Nellithope prepared the building plan and parish priest of Cathedral Rev.Fr.Fourcaud commenced the construction of the new church in 1902 at the Southern side of Pondicherry.
The blessing of the church and the first mass was held at the western wing of the present church by Mgr. Gandhi on 17, December 1907 and the new parish surrounding this church has been established on 27, January 1908.
Centenary Celebrations.
The year 2008-2009 was celebrated as centenary year of founding of the parish. A special postal stamp and postal envelope were released to mark the valedictory function of the centenary celebrations.
Elevation to Basilica Status.
At the end of the Centenary Celebrations on June 2009, a request was placed through Telesphore Toppo, President of CBCI, to the Holy See for the elevation of this church to a Basilica.
The Holy See granted the status of minor basilica to the church, with a papal brief dated Friday 24 June 2011. This arrived on Friday 29 July 2011 to archbishops house. This was officially announced by Mgr. Antony Anandarayar, Archbishop of Pondicherry and Cuddalore on July 29, 2011. The Papal Nuncio to India, Salvatore Pennacchio (Titular Archbishop of Montemarano) visited the basilica on September 2, 2011 and officially declared the church as a basilica in the name of the holy see.
At present the basilica is headed by Rector S. Maria Joseph.
Structure.
This 100 years old historical church is 50 mts. long 48 mts. wide and 18 mts. high with Latin rite cross shape in aerial view is in Gothic style. 24 main columns hold the structure. The biblical verse from 2 Chronicles 7:16 is written above the entrance door in Latin "sanctificavi locum istum, ut sit nomen meum ibi" which means "I have consecrated this house, that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there forever.". Inside the church there are glass pictures of 28 saints who were related to the devotion of Sacred Heart of Jesus.
This 100-year old church has been led by twenty parish priests. The Grotto for Our Lady of Lourdes, Parish Hall, Adoration chapel and the new parish community hall were some of the development of this church since the 1960s. After the arrival of parish priest Thomas in 2005 the church was fully renovated inside and out.
Statues of the four evangelists were erected, beneath which there are four lamp posts describing their lives and the inviting Jesus and the twelve apostles on the front facade. The Grotto for Sacred Heart of Jesus facing the City Railway Station were added and the church illuminated inside and out with chandeliers, focus and flood lights.

Poverty and NGOs in Cambodia

Poverty.
In Cambodia, the population living under the national poverty line of US$0.93 per capita per day in 2009 (Ministry of Planning, 2013) is defined as the poor. In 2009, about 22.9% of Cambodians live below the national poverty line indicating that at least one in five Cambodians are still living in deprivation. They lack sufficient resources to meet their daily needs. Cambodia’s long history of violence and conflict, both internally and externally has contributed to the current poverty situation. Most notably in Cambodia’s troubled history was the Khmer Rouge regime and a period of occupation under Vietnam’s communist leaders from 1980 to 1989. As such, it was not until recently did the political situation in Cambodia settled down. Since then, its economy has been growing from strength to strength, driven by the expansion in the garment, construction, tourism and agricultural sector.
However, a good proportion of Cambodians that are living in rural areas are not experiencing the prosperity especially in the plateau and mountainous region. More than 80% of the Cambodian population is rural and mainly employed in the agricultural sector. Many small-scale farmers practice agriculture at subsistence level, using traditional methods that are low in productivity. Two thirds of the country's 1.6 million rural households face seasonal food shortages each year. Rice alone accounts for as much as 30 per cent of household expenditures.
The rural citizens are the people who have the least access to education, health and other public services because of poor infrastructures and lack of government investment in areas where it matters most. In 2007, education expenditure only accounted for 1.6% of Cambodia’s total GDP putting it amongst the ranks of other poorer nations. As a result, only 78% of adults above the age of 15 are literate.
Rampant corruption amongst the political elites and government bureaucrats is a key factor that has been hindering improvements in poverty levels. In 2010, Cambodia was ranked 154th out of 178 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) with a given score of 2.1 out of 10 indicating just how perverse corruption is at every level of the Cambodian society. Yet, this is already considered an improvement from previous years. This is a deterrent for foreign investments and foreign aids that are very much needed for Cambodia to sustain its economic growth and alleviate the poor out of poverty.
Even though growth in GDP per capita in the past decade has led to decreasing poverty rates, it is not happening at a rate that equals to economic growth rates. Additionally, the economic growth is increasing the gap in inequality between the very poor and the rich.

Ashtavakra (epic)

Aṣṭāvakra () (2010) is a Hindi epic poem (Mahakavya) composed by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya (1950–) in the year 2009. It consists of 864 verses in 8 cantos (sargas) of 108 verses each. The poem presents the narrative of the Ṛṣi Aṣṭāvakra which is found in the Hindu scriptures of the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. A copy of the epic was published by the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University, Chitrakuta, Uttar Pradesh. The book was released on January 14, 2010, on the sixtieth birthday ("Ṣaṣṭipūrti") of the poet.
The protagonist of the epic, Aṣṭāvakra, is physically disabled with eight deformities in his body. The epic presents his journey from adversity to success to final redemption. According to the poet, who is also disabled having lost his eyesight at the age of two months, the notions of aphoristic solutions for universal difficulties of the disabled are presented the epic, and the eight cantos are the analyses of the eight dispositions in the mind of the disabled.
Narrative.
The epic narrates the life of Aṣṭāvakra as found in the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the "Vana parva" of the Mahābhārata, the Aṣṭāvakra Gītā and the play "Uttararamacarita" by Bhavabhuti. The sage Uddālaka, the Ṛṣi mentioned in the Chandogya Upaniṣad, has a disciple by the name Kahola. Uddālaka offers his daughter Sujātā in marriage to Kahola, and the newly-wed couple starts living in an Āśrama in a forest. Sujātā becomes pregnant after some years. The child, while still in the womb, one day tells its father Kahola that he is making eight errors in each Vedic Mantra while reciting them at night. Enraged, Kahola curses the child to be born with all eight limbs (feet, knees, hands, chest and head) deformed.
Meanwhile, there is a drought in the forest and Sujātā sends Kahola to Mithilā to earn some money from King Janaka. A courtier of Janaka, Bandī (Vandī) defeats Kahola in "Śāstrārtha" (verbal duel on the meaning of scriptures) and immerses the Ṛṣi under water using the "Varuṇapāśa". Uddālaka apprises Sujātā of her husband's fate and asks her to keep the events secret from her child.
The child born to Sujātā is named Aṣṭāvakra by Uddālaka. At the same time a son is born to Uddālaka and is named Śvetaketu. Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu grow up like brothers, and learn the scriptures from Uddālaka. Aṣṭāvakra thinks Uddālaka is his father and Śvetaketu his brother. At the age of ten years, on learning that his real father is imprisoned by Bandī, Aṣṭāvakra decides to go to Mithilā to free his father. Aṣṭāvakra travels to Mithilā with his uncle Śvetaketu and defeats respectively the gatekeeper, king Janaka and Bandī in "Śāstrārtha", and then secures the release of his father Kahola.
On their way back home, Kahola makes Aṣṭāvakra bathe in the river Samaṅgā and Aṣṭāvakra becomes free of the eight deformities in his body. At the end, Aṣṭāvakra, inspired by the sage Vasiṣṭha, arrives in the court of Sītā and Rāma, and is elated to be honoured in the assembly of Ayodhyā.
Themes.
Revolutionism.
The poet states that the genre of his poetry is Revolutionism ("Krāntivāda"). In the second canto, the poet defines the true revolution as one caused by change in thoughts. Aṣṭāvakra, while speaking to Kahola, says that Oṃ Śāntiḥ ("Hail Peace!") is the old proclamation, the new one should be Oṃ Krāntiḥ ("Hail Revolution!"). On lines of the Oṃ Śāntiḥ Mantra, the new Mantra is to call for revolution everywhere –
Devanagari
परमपावन आपः क्रान्तिः ओषधिः सङ्क्रान्तिमय हो ॥ 
महाकाव्यच्छन्द क्रान्तिः ब्रह्मभव सङ्क्रान्तिमय हो ॥ 
IAST
dyauḥ krāntiḥ nabhaḥ krāntiḥ bhāgyabhūmābhūmi krāntiḥ । 
paramapāvana āpaḥ krāntiḥ oṣadhiḥ saṅkrāntimaya ho ॥ 
navavanaspativṛnda krāntiḥ viśvadevaspanda krāntiḥ । 
mahākāvyacchanda krāntiḥ brahmabhava saṅkrāntimaya ho ॥ 
Meaning of Aṣṭāvakra.
In the epic, the poet derives the name Aṣṭāvakra as the Sandhi of "Aṣṭa" meaning eight and "Avakra" meaning not deformed or straight. In the verses 1.98 to 1.100, five interpretations are given for the word Aṣṭāvakra using this Sandhi decomposition.
Philosophy.
Verses dealing with philosophy are found at several places in the epic. The soliloquy by Aṣṭāvakra in the third canto includes verses on the nature of the Self (3.61–3.82), according to the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Vedānta. A part of the instruction by Uddālaka to Aṣṭāvakra in the sixth canto (6.56–6.60) has the same subject. The phraseology used in some of these verses is the same as that used in the Vedas, the Upaniṣads and the Bhagavad Gītā. A metaphor used in the explanation of Sādhanā (6.4–6.5) combines all the six Āstika schools of Hindu philosophy – Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Vaiśeṣika, Nyāya, Mimāṃsā and Vedānta. In the seventh canto, when Aṣṭāvakra enters Mithilā, he finds scholars of all the six schools (7.27–7.28). The various sub-schools of the Vedānta are also referred to, along with the seventh school of Bhakti. The verse 8.4 mentions the differing opinions about the worldly creation in the Hindu philosophy – some say it is made of "Śabda", while some say it is either "Pariṇāma" or "Vivarta". The poet agrees with the former ("Pariṇāma") view.
Social messages.
In various contexts of the epic, several contemporary social issues relevant to India and the world are raised. The issues are brought up in soliloquies by or dialogues between the characters in the epic. These include bias against the girl child, reservation and merit, and the state of the disabled, among others.
Bias against the girl child.
The girl child has been historically discriminated against in the Indian society, due to several cultural and economic factors. The preference for sons and discrimination against the female child continues to date, reflected in statistics like child sex ratio (skewed by female infanticide and sex-selective abortions), and lower literacy rates for women. The poet raises the issue of gender inequality in the first (1.12, 1.57–1.59) and the fifth (5.17) cantos of the epic. The following verse is from the first canto in the context of the dialogue between Uddālaka and Kahola, where Uddālaka tells Kahola about the birth of Sujātā. Says Uddālaka –
Devanagari
मानवता का यही मन्त्र है यही प्रकृति का है उपहार । 
नहीं भ्रूणहत्या विधेय है श्रुतिविरुद्ध यह कृत्य अशुद्ध ॥ 
IAST
kanyā nahīṃ bhāra hai śirakā yahī sṛṣṭi kā hai śrṛṃgāra 
mānavatā kā yahī mantra hai yahī prakṛti kā hai upahāra । 
kokha pavitra sutā se hotī putrī se gṛha hotā śuddha 
nahīṃ bhrūṇahatyā vidheya hai śrutiviruddha yaha kṛtya aśuddha ॥ 
Reservations.
Reservation in the educational institutes, public sector and its proposal for private sector is a controversial and much debated issue in India. Different caste and religious groups have demanded reservations in educational institutes and/or public sector in recent times, which has often led to unrest, protests, and conflicts between judiciary and legislature. In the fifth canto of the epic, while speaking to himself when comparing the learning abilities of Aṣṭāvakra (who is disabled) with those of Śvetaketu and other disciples, Uddālaka says –
Devanagari
न कदापि राष्ट्रहित में समुचित । 
अवनति का पथ अतिशय अनुचित ॥ 
IAST
prātibha kṣetra meṃ ārakṣaṇa 
na kadāpi rāṣṭrahita meṃ samucita । 
yaha ghora nirādara pratibhā kā 
avanati kā patha atiśaya anucita ॥ 
Bias against the disabled.
The issue of prejudice and discrimination against the disabled is raised in multiple contexts. In the dialogue between Uddālaka and Kahola in the first canto, Uddālaka says that with the success of Aṣṭāvakra, the disabled will no longer be deprived of their rights by the society. They will not be pushovers anymore, no more be regarded as bad omens in auspicious rituals, and would be treated with equality. In the fourth canto, while speaking to Sujāta, Uddālaka says – the notion that the disabled are a burden on family and not worthy of attention will decay the world. He cautions against insulting and humiliating the disabled, and advises treating them with respect, else even the tears of the disabled will trample one in turn. In the seventh canto, in Aṣṭāvakra's soliloquy, the poet says that making fun of the disabled is never appropriate, for they are created by the same craftsman as the entire creation. An example verse is –
Devanagari
क्या उपेक्ष्या पात्र वह सकलांग का । 
यह विषम अवधारणा कुसमाज की ॥ 
IAST
bhāra hai vikalāṃga kyā parivāra kā 
kyā upekṣyā pātra vaha sakalāṃga kā । 
jagata ko jarjarita kara degī jhaṭiti 
yaha viṣama avadhāraṇā kusamāja kī ॥ 
Poetic features.
Rasas.
The principle Rasas in the epic are the "Vīra" (heroism or bravery) and the "Karuṇa" (compassion) Rasas. Aṣṭāvakra's soliloquy after his father's curse (third canto), Kahola's repentance of the curse (fourth canto) and the conversation between Uddālaka's and Sujātā after Kahola's drowning in water are contexts with compassion and pathos. Aṣṭāvakra's determination and resolve to liberate is father (fifth canto) and his journey to Mithilā (sixth canto) are the notable contexts with the emotion of heroism.
Figures of Speech.
Anuprāsa (Alliteration) and Yamaka.
"Yamaka" is a kind of pun in Saṃskṛta (and also in Hindi and other Prākṛta languages) where a word occurs multiple times and each occurrence has a different meaning. An example of alliteration ("Anuprāsa") mixed with "Yamaka" from the epic is the second half of the verse 7.32 –
Devanagari
भवभूषण दूषणरिपुदूषणदूषण निमिकुलभूषण । 
IAST
aṅga aṅga para vilasa rahe the lalitalalāma vibhūṣaṇa 
bhavabhūṣaṇa dūṣaṇaripudūṣaṇa dūṣaṇa nimikulabhūṣaṇa । 
In the second half of verse the 1.21, the poet uses the words "raurava" and "gaurava" in the same line four and three times respectively, with a different meaning in each occurrence.
Devanagari
गौरवमय अभिमान विवर्जित श्रितगौरव हितगौरव थे ॥ 
IAST
rauravasahita rahita raurava se rauravakṛta jitaraurava the 
gauravamaya abhimāna vivarjita śritagaurava hitagaurava the ॥ 
Bhaṣāsamaka.
At several places in the epic (1.85, 4.100, 8.106 and 8.108), the poet uses the Bhāṣāsamaka (also known as Maṇipravāla) figure of speech, where Saṃskṛta and Hindi are blended together. An example is this verse in which the etymology of the name Sujātā is explained using Nirukta.
Devanagari
अष्टावक्र सुभग जातक की बनी सुजाता मातु सही ॥ 
IAST
subhago jāto yasyāḥ saiva sujātā nāma nirukti yahī 
aṣṭāvakra subhaga jātaka kī banī sujātā mātu sahī ॥ 
Mudrā.
In the "Mudrā" figure of speech, the metre used to compose the verse is indicated by the use of its name in the verse. The last verse of the third canto in Aṣṭāvakra is composed in the "Śārdūlavikrīḍita" metre (a metre commonly used in Saṃskṛta epics), and also contains the word "śārdūlavikrīḍitam".
Devanagari
त्यों ही बिप्र कहोल के नयन भी नीरन्ध्रवर्षी बने । 
गाएँ देव सभी कहोलसुत का शार्दूलविक्रीडितम् ॥ 
IAST
aṣṭāvakra maharṣi vākya kaha rahe jyoṃ ho rahe mauna the 
tyoṃ hī bipra kahola ke nayana bhī nīrandhravarṣī bane । 
sīmantonnayanīya vedavidhi bhī sampanna prāyaḥ huī 
gāeँ deva sabhī kaholasuta kā śārdūlavikrīḍitam ॥ 
In his Saṃskṛta epic Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam, the poet Rāmabhadrācārya has used this figure of speech at eight places.
The debates in Mithilā.
Four conversations are described in the seventh and eighth cantos of the epic. These include the first conversation between Aṣṭāvakra and Janaka, followed by the three debates of Aṣṭāvakra – the first one to convince the gatekeeper to let him into the assembly; then his answers to the cryptic questions of Janaka; and finally the "Śāstrārtha" between Bandī and Aṣṭāvakra, in which the seemingly simple enumerations of the numbers one to thirteen belie enigmas and latent meanings which lie beneath. These conversations in the epic are the same as in the Mahābhārata, and the comparison between the poetry in the Saṃskṛta of Mahābhārata and the Hindi of Aṣṭāvakra is noteworthy.
Reception.
Critical Response.
The Readers' Forum of the Madhya Pradesh Sahitya Akademi organised a conference of reviewers in September 2010 to critique the epic in Ashoknagar. The chief reviewer, Professor S N Saxena, said that the epic is the story from struggle to success, and is a source of inspiration for the disabled, coming out of the poet's own experience. Other reviewers at the conference included writers Ram Sevak Soni, Sudhir Gupta, Subhash Jain Saral and Pradeep Manoria. The reviewers said that the epic describes the feelings and the rise of the disabled and it is very relevant in the contemporary world. The Madhya Pradesh Sahitya Akademi organized another conference of reviewers at Damoh in November 2010, where various littérateurs discussed the epic.

Dui (vessel)

Dui or Tui () is a type of Chinese ritual bronze vessel used in the late Zhou dynasty and the Warring States period of ancient China. It was a food container used as a ritual vessel. Most Dui consist of two bowls supported on three legs.
Form.
The 'Dui' is typically spherical in shape, possessing a half-domed bowl on bottom with a similarly shaped container fitting on top. Shapes vary from circular, ovular, or subcircular. Types from the late Eastern Zhou appear more spheroidal; containers become more ovular during the Spring and Autumn Period; and transitioning from the late Spring and Autumn to the Warring States period, vessel types appear less round in shape, possessing a flattened lid paired with a rounded bowl. The vessel stands on either a single pedestal or is supported by three legs (similarly to the ding). The three legs would permit heating of the food within. Each vessel sports two handles; either set or unfixed rings adorn the bottom portion of the vessel, allowing for easy transport.
Decor.
The containers themselves possess highly intricate detailing, varying in geometric and curvilinear designs distributed in symmetrical registers. Many of these carvings assume biomorphic forms, depicting typical animal imagery found throughout ancient China such as cats, snakes, dragons or birds. Much of the designs are in-laid with metal, though few complete renditions still exist.
Examples.
From the specimen found from the Warring States period, proof of copper in-lay can be found in swirling spherical patterns that accentuate the shape of the "Dui". Incised geometric patterning along with cat-like outlines emanate from the container.
Types coming out of the Late Eastern Zhou are spherical in form and possess three animal masks in relief; the heads are situated symmetrically around the lid, mirroring the three Ding-like feet supporting the base. Simple linear patterning covers the vessel in clearly defined registers, while high-relief rope bands separate the basin from the lid.
From the Warring States period, ovular forms become subcircular shapes. Four fantastical creatures adorn the lid of this period's example, forming upright rings. Animal pendant masks hold moveable rings in their mouths, allowing for easy transport. In-lay patterning surfaces in this example too, with turquoise and silver in typical registers. Curvilinear patterns accentuate the shape; the more prominent bands of decoration portray symmetrical bird figures with intertwining bodies encircling the vessel. Border designs consist of S-shaped bands around the foot, lid, and body.
Function and Usage.
In some examples the two symmetric hemispheres could be used individually or as a bowl with lid when facilitating the ritual process. Lidded varieties are evidenced by the lack of supporting structure on each bowl. The vessel might be displayed prominently within a temple or hall but also found use during feasts commemorating ancestors. At times, the vessel was produced solely for burial. In later periods the vessel became a symbol of societal prominence and the religious aspect receded.
Historical Development.
The dui functioned and was created in the Late Zhou dynasties and Warring States period in early China. The dui is one of the earliest types of near-spherical shape of vessel. In the middle of the Spring and Autumn period, people gradually began to use the dui as a warming and serving food vessel. According to scholar K.C. Chang, the term "dui" was said to have been written in the catalogue incorrectly by cataloguers from the Song dynasty. First seen in Eastern Zhou, "dui" means "gobular vessel," but in Shang and Western Zhou, this particular vessel was called "gui." Dui was transcribed into the modern equivalent of gui.
Some dui vessels were inspired by nomadic Steppe art with sophisticated designs and colorful exteriors. After the Eastern Zhou dynasty, the dui might have been seen as a status symbol or used in various rituals. It was most popular during the Late Zhou Dynasty, but later it was replaced by another food container named "Sheng" that was used during the Qin and Han dynasties. In the Warring States Period, the form was changed to an oval and the lid was transformed to reflect the body in a mirror image. They are sometimes marked as "watermelon ding" which were dated back to the early Warring States Period.
Important Examples.
In 2004, there was a dui vessel discovered in tomb M6 in Zhenghan Road, Zinzheng City by the Zingheng Work Station of the Henan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute. There was also a dui that belonged in the tomb of Marquis of Qi, found in Yixian County, Hebei Province.

OPENCities

OPENCities is a project initiated by British Council Spain, to help cities to become more open and competitive. OPENCities demonstrates how international populations contribute to cities long term economic success and advocates for openness as a way forward for cities willing to play an international role. It has developed a tool to benchmark and analyse openness (the OPENCities Monitor). Overall, the project's goal is to highlight the importance of openness for cities' international success and competitiveness.
Purpose.
Worldwide people are migrating to cities and by 2050 two thirds of the world population will live in urban areas. This growing urbanisation, together with the commercial and economic globalisation results in increasingly diverse population. The importance of human capital and human creativity as one of the key location factors explaining sustainable economic long-term growth is significant and rising, with urban regions competing globally to attract the highly qualified and talented labour.
Cities must therefore be attractive and open. They must provide a tolerant environment for talents and technology (Richard Florida) to attract and retain these international population groups. OPENCities identifies the link between international migration and economic growth, measures the multidimensional phenomenon of openness and provides qualitative recommendations towards internationalisation, integration and diversity policies on local level.
Definition of openness.
In the context of the OPENCities project, openness is defined as “the capacity of a city to attract international populations and to enable them to contribute to the future success of the city”.
As openness is a multi-dimensional phenomenon it can be hardly measured. During the OPENCities Monitor feasibility study conducted by BAK Basel Economics, 54 indicators were identified to measure openness towards international populations in quantitative as well as qualitative terms. These indicators were mainly chosen due to their international availability and comparability on city or regional level. 
These indicators capture inputs and overall conditions as well as outputs or outcomes. They also take into account the perception of international migration groups regarding immigration policy or the value of ethnic diversity. Later on, they are aggregated into 11 areas with different weightings, namely:
The different weightings of the indicator results are based on a survey conducted by BAKBASEL Economics among 140 respondents in 16 cities. The weights were apportioned due to the relative importance and the validity as well as availability of the indicators.
Organisation of OPENCities.
OPENCities is a British Council project. The European Union (EU), funded an URBACT project, led by Belfast City Council, with the following partners Bilbao, Bucharest, Cardiff, Dublin, Düsseldorf, Nitra, Poznan, Sofia and Vienna. Outside URBACT, other cities have been active partners (Madrid, Cardiff) and collaborators (Edinburgh, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham). Besides, others have been included in the OPENCities Monitor and participated in different ways: London, Toronto, São Paulo, Auckland, Barcelona, Beijing, Belfast, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Chongqing, Los Angeles and New York.
The Story of OPENCities.
The story of OPENCities started in 2008 with the fundamental work of Greg Clark “Towards OPEN Cities” showcasing the importance of openness as a location factor, the trends in demographic changes in cities, the opportunities that measurement and benchmarking of openness could present and initial policy recommendations. Since 2008, OPENCities moved forward as follows:
The OPENCities Monitor.
The OPENCities Monitor developed by BAK Basel Economics currently displays and demonstrates the results of 26 cities worldwide, compares their performance in several ways and gives further policy recommendations.
An extended city-sample is up-coming in 2012. It’s planned to include more than 100 cities in the OPENCities Monitor.
Cities currently included are Auckland, Barcelona, Beijing, Belfast, Bilbao, Bucharest, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Cardiff, Chongqing, Dublin, Düsseldorf, Edinburgh, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Manchester, New York, Nitra, Newcastle, Nottingham, Poznan, São Paulo, Sofia, Toronto and Vienna.
Target groups of OPENCities.
The target group of OPENCities are local policy leaders. OPENCities introduced openness as the focus in which to base local action plans, centred in three areas:
The OPENCities project supports their implementation and development. City leaders get access to relevant city data, can benchmark their results and obtain recommendations to improve their policies.
The project highlights that attracting international talent brings economic welfare as well as social diversity. Cities must be very careful to highlight the importance of human rights, diversity and integration campaigns of NGOs on the local policy level and must make migrants participate and regard their specific needs and contributions in the city.
Researchers find here a platform for publishing and accessing articles and reports. Responsible media can use OPENCities to find reports that help them to communicate the importance of migration in cities, particularly the importance to minimise social clashes in times of economic recession.
Finally, business is an essential element, as they are in need of talent and innovation and have huge vested interest in ensuring that the city is open to diversity.

Outsource marketing

Outsourcing has been a growing area for business. It is primarily associated with ‘support functions’ such as IT, HR or Accounting. Marketing outsourcing, whilst common in the US, has not yet been embraced by British industry, but the economic downturn means that many businesses may well look to this form of cost reduction.
Outsource marketing is the art of handing over the entire marketing demands of a company to a third party. This offers three distinct benefits:
Firstly companies can access higher quality talent that they might ordinarily be able to attract into an in-house department.
Secondly, outsourcing negates the need for an in-house team, thus reducing overhead – clients can literally operate with a bare bones marketing team, or even none at all.
Thirdly, outsourcing reduces or eliminates the need for multiple, biased specialist agencies – all the marketing requirements are catered for by one centralised agency offering media-neutral and discipline-neutral marketing.
Businesses and Brands can achieve all of these benefits with the added bonus of flexibility (up-weighting or downscaling the requirements at any point), which suits the uncertainty of the economic environment.
Marketing outsourcing should not be confused with sales outsourcing or working with a contract sales organization.
The challenging economic backdrop has meant that major corporations have begun outsourcing significant parts of their marketing. For instance, the Guardian newspaper outsource most of their marketing design in May 2010.

California Green Building Standards Code

The California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen Code) is Part 11 of the California Building Standards Code and is the first statewide "green" building code in the US.
Background and purpose.
The purpose of CALGreen is to improve public health, safety and general welfare by enhancing the design and construction of buildings through the use of building concepts having a reduced negative impact or positive environmental impact and encouraging sustainable construction practices in the following categories:
To achieve CALGreen Tier 1, buildings must comply with the latest edition of "Savings By Design, Healthcare Modeling Procedures". To achieve CALGreen Tier 2, buildings must exceed the latest edition of “Savings By Design, Healthcare Modeling Procedures” by a minimum of 15%.
The provisions of this code are directed to:
Land use.
In US urban land area quadrupled from 1945 to 2002, increasing at about twice the rate of population growth over this period. Estimated area of rural land used for residential purposes increased by (29%) from 1997 to 2002 (2002).
Water use.
Water is a precious natural resource. At least two-thirds of the United States have experienced or are bracing for local, regional, or statewide water shortages. US population, and in particular California population has constantly increased during the last decades,so using water wisely is crucial in order to provide enough water also for the future generations.
During the 20th century, water diverted south through the California Aqueduct was economically essential to Los Angeles. But fisheries, wildlife and water quality in the bay and delta paid a heavy price. Water is becoming an increasingly important resource throughout California and the United States.
The largest single use of water use is the cooling towers of power plants, followed by water used to irrigate for agriculture. Combined, these two uses account for over 80% of all domestic water use. The largest remaining segment of water use is that of public water supplies.
Air and atmosphere.
On average, the energy use for typical buildings is assumed to consist of 67% electricity and 33% natural gas 
Materials and waste.
Approximately 170 million tons of building-related C&D materials were generated in the U.S. during 2003. This is a 25% increase in generation from the 1996 estimate of 136 million tons ( which was 25% to 40% of the national solid waste stream).
Provisions.
The residential mandatory measures are provided in chapter 4 and the non-residential ones in chapter 5 of CALGreen Code.
About the residential mandatory measures, the Code provides measures like storm water drainage and retention systems thought to prevent flooding of adjacent properties and prevent pollution from storm water runoff by retaining soil on-site or by providing filtering to restrict sedimentation from reaching storm water drainage systems and receiving streams or rivers. To comply, retention basin has to be sized and shown on the site plan, and water has to be filtered and routed to a public drainage system. The new residential structure has to also comply with local storm water ordinances.
The drainage system has to be shown on the site plan (swales, drain piping, retention areas, ground water recharge).
CALGreen does not regulate energy efficiency (both for residential and non-residential structures), instead remanding it to the California Energy Commission (CEC) and its California Energy Code.
Concerning the water issue, the code requires a 20% reduction of indoor water use and it uses both a prescriptive and performance method.
The prescriptive method provides some technical features that have to be followed: 
The performance method uses the performance calculation worksheets in Chapter 8 (or other calculation acceptable to the enforcing agency).
CALGreen also specifies acceptable performance standards for plumbing fixtures with reduced water usage. Fixtures can be installed if they meet standards listed in Table 4.303.3.
Also outdoor water usage is regulated: the Code requires irrigation controls to be weather- or soil moisture-based and automatically adjust irrigation in response to changes in plants' needs as weather conditions change, or have rain sensors or communication systems that account for local rainfall.
About construction waste reduction, disposal, and recycling, the code says that at least 50% of nonhazardous construction and demolition debris have to be recycled and/or salvaged. This has to be done through the development of a waste management plan submitted for approval to the enforcing agency.
CALGreen Appendix A4 contains the voluntary measures (Tier 1 and Tier 2) that were developed in response to numerous stakeholder requests for a statewide method of enhancing green construction practiced beyond the Code’s minimum levels. To meet Tier 1 or Tier 2, designers, builders, or property owners must increase the number of green building measures and further reduce percentages of water and energy use and waste to landfills in order to meet the threshold levels for each tier (these measures are listed in Section A4.601.4.2 (Tier 1) and Section A4.601.5.2 (Tier 2)).
Also for non-residential structures CALGreen demands 20% savings of potable water, standards for plumbing fixtures and fittings, a construction waste management plan, and a construction reduction waste of at least 50%.
The Code also requires a finish material pollutant control and an acoustical control for exterior noise transmission and interior sound.
The CALGreen 2010 Code was adopted by the California Building Standards Commission (CBSC), the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the Division of the State Architect (DSA) within the California Department of General Services, and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) within the California Health and Human Services Agency.
CBSC has the responsibility to administer the program and review building standards proposed by state agencies, develop building standards for occupancies where no other state agency has the authority (non-residential) and adopt and approve building standards for publication.
The targets of the Code are designers, architects, builders, property owners, and also businesses and the government that have to take into consideration the new standards when they decide to build new structures.
History.
Several legislative bills like AB 35, AB 888, and AB 1058 were introduced during the 2007-2008 legislative session to require green building standards for state-owned or leased buildings, commercial buildings, and residential buildings respectively.
Development of CALGreen began in 2007 and, during the rulemaking process, CBSC collaborated with the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), stakeholder groups and others. The first result of this cooperation was the adoption of the 2008 California Green Building Standards Code (CGBC) that became effective since August 1, 2009.
The initial 2008 California Green Building Code publication provided a framework and first step toward establishing green building standards for low-rise residential structures. 
2008 GBSC was used as a base document, analyzed and evaluated for necessary updates that lead to the 2010 CALGreen Code, but this is not the last step of the process: as new materials, technology, and designs are developed and become available, also CALGreen has to develop.
There are some enhancements from the 2008 Code to the 2010 one, among them:
Policy tools.
CALGreen 2010 uses prescriptive regulation (it provides technical characteristics that have to be met in the construction of new buildings).
Economists and industry, often criticize this kind of regulation because it provides little reason for innovation once the regulated party has achieved the required standard. However CALGreen provides just the minimum standard to achieve and it delegates to Local authorities to increase the level of the standards to apply (depending on the particular characteristics of the local area).
This tool is the most effective to solve in the long run the environmental problems faced by this policy because fixing technical characteristics that have to be followed in the construction process it assures that all the new buildings will have certain desirable characteristics of efficiency.
CALGreen 2010 alleviates the environmental problems connected with residential and non-residential structures, but it doesn’t solve them both because it is limited to the new buildings.
Stakeholders.
There are a lot of players interested in CALGreen and in its evolution. 
Policy targets are important stakeholders: designers, architects, builders, property owners and in general also businesses, the government and its agencies.
Some of the stakeholders try to influence the evolution of the policy participating to CBSC’s and HCD’s Green Building Focus Groups (stakeholder focus groups). They are: building officials; representatives from the construction industry; representatives from the environmental community; state agency representatives and public members.
There are also government agencies involved. A part from CBSC, HCD, DSA, and OSHPD, the following agencies contribute to the formulation of the policy: Air Resource Board (for standards concerning air pollutants), California Integrated Waste Management Board (CalRecycle) (for what concerns landfill disposals), the Department of General Services, the Department of Public Health, the Department of Water Resources and the Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission).
Building officials are interested in the policy because they want to know what are the new standards and what processes lead to them in order to understand how to do their job in the best way possible.
Construction Industry is very interested in influencing the policy because changes in the standards could mean changes in suppliers and maybe also increasing costs and they are mainly interested in minimizing costs.
Producers of plumbing fixtures or companies that produce insulation systems for the house are interested in CALGreen because it modifies their sectors (like it modify also the construction industry); the change can be encouraged by those companies that produce energy or water saving products or it can be obstructed by those that are not ready yet.
The environmentalists are interested in maximize the level of the mandatory provisions contained in the policy in order to maximize the benefits for the environment.
State agencies like the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development are instead interested in protecting particular benefits for the community (in the case of OSHPD the health).
Policy evaluation.
HCD organizes annual and triennial focus group meetings among stakeholders to check the effectiveness of the policy adopted and to discuss proposed changes to the code.
CALGreen 2010 is effective since January 1, 2011, so it’s still too early for evaluate its effectiveness.
However both BIG and LEED are successful standards similar to CALGreen.
The system developed by Build-it-Green is called GreenPoint Rated Climate Calculator and initial project run-throughs using the Climate Calculator found emissions reductions of about 20% over conventional new construction built to code.
In March 2008 a study of the New Buildings Institute found that on average, LEED-NC buildings deliver anticipated savings and that LEED energy use is similar to predictions: 25–30% better than the national average (average savings increase for the higher LEED levels).

Vionnet (company)

Vionnet is a haute couture label founded by the French couturier Madeleine Vionnet. Established in 1912, the house of Vionnet closed in 1939 before to be formally resurrected in 2006.
The Madeleine Vionnet Years.
From 1912 to 1914.
The House of Vionnet opened in 1912 at 222, Rue de Rivoli. Madeleine Vionnet provided one-third of the financing while the remaining investment was supplied by one of her clients, Germaine Lilas, Henri's Lillas' daughter, the owner of the Parisian department store Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville (BHV). In 1914, when World War I started, Madeleine Vionnet closed the house and set off to visit Rome.
From 1919 to 1940.
In 1919, the house reopened after the war. Mr. Martinez de Hoz, an Argentinian, joined Mr. Lillas as main shareholder of the house. During the same period, Thayaht, a futurist artist, created Vionnet's logo and started designing textiles, clothing and jewelry for the house.
In 1922, Théophile Bader, owner of the Galeries Lafayette, joined current shareholders Mr. de Hoz and Mr. Lillas in a new venture called Vionnet & Cie and became the majority shareholder. Few months later, on April 15, 1923, Vionnet's new premises opened at 50, Avenue Montaigne. The so-called "Temple of Fashion", a collaboration of architect Ferdinand Chanut, decorator George de Feure and crystal sculptor René Lalique, incorporated a spectacular Salon de Présentation and two boutiques: a fur salon and a lingerie salon. 1923 was a very active year for the house: Vionnet co-founded the first anticopyist Association (L'Association pour la Défense des Arts Plastiques et Appliqués), hosted in the House's premises and directed Vionnet & Cie's managing director; Vionnet introduced fingerprinted labels to authenticate models (each garment produced in Vionnet studios bears a label featuring Vionnet's original signing and an imprint of Vionnet's right thumb); Vionnet & Cie entered into a distribution arrangement with Charles and Ray Gutman, who own Charles & Ray Ladies' Tailors and Importers in New York City. In November, the first collection of Vionnet clothing shown at Charles and Ray was an enormous success.
In 1924, architect and designer Boris Lacroix was appointed art director of the House. From 1924 to 1937, he designed furniture, logos, printed textiles, handbags, accessories and took part in the planning of Vionnet's perfumes.
In the mid-1920s, the house was extremely active in the USA. In 1924, Vionnet & Cie signed an exclusive production and distribution agreement with Fifth Avenue retail store Hickson Inc. In February 1924, the Vionnet New York Salon opened at Hickson and an exclusive collection of gowns was presented. In 1925, Vionnet & Cie was the first French couture house to open a subsidiary in New York: Madeleine Vionnet Inc., located at 661 Fifth Avenue. The salon sold 'one-size-fits-all' designs with unfinished hems, to be adjusted to fit individual clients. Vionnet also produced ready-to-wear designs for US wholesale. Arguably the first prêt-à-porter ever made from Paris haute couture, the garments bore a label signed by Madeleine Vionnet along with "Repeated Original" as a trademark name.
During this time, in France, Vionnet opened a salon in the Grand Casino at Biarritz. in 1925, the house launched its first limited edition perfume comprising four fragrances named alphabetically: 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'. The geometrical bottle was designed by Boris Lacroix while the scent was made in collaboration with the House of Coty.
In 1927, Vionnet opened a school within her couture house to teach apprentices how to create clothing on the bias cut. In 1929, Vionnet led the establishment of a new anticopyist association, the P.A.I.S., directed by Armand Trouyet, managing director of Vionnet & Cie.
In 1932, the House acquired a new five-storey building at 50, Avenue Montaigne housing 21 workshops along with a clinic (equipped with both doctors and dentists) and a gymnasium. At this time, the house employed 1,200 seamstresses. Vionnet was one of the most important Parisian fashion houses of the 1930s. When World War II approached, a reorganization of the House was contemplated. Eventually, Vionnet decided to close her House. On August 2, 1939, Madeleine Vionnet showed her farewell collection.
The Sleeping Years.
In 1952, years after the closing of her house, Madeleine Vionnet donated most of her designs to the archives of the UFAC (today part of the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris) including 120 dresses from 1921 to 1939.
In 1988, the Vionnet label was acquired by the Lummen family. The family kept a low profile approach, avoiding new fashion collections and focusing on accessories and new perfumes (launch of "Madeleine Vionnet" in 1996 and "MV" in 1998).
The Revival Years.
2006-2008 - The Lummen Era.
In July 2006, following years of speculations, Arnaud de Lummen, CEO of the house, announced a return on the fashion scene. He promised ""a unique and genuine approach to bring forward the Vionnet vision"" and not a simple revival. Sophia Kokosalaki, then at the peak of her fame, was appointed Creative Director of the house. A debut clothing collection was launched for Spring/Summer 2007 - the first Vionnet clothing collection in 67 years.
The first new collection was unveiled to the public in December 2006 within the US edition of "Vogue". From early 2007, this first new Vionnet collection became exclusively available in the house atelier in Paris and within Barneys New York flagship stores in the USA. Sophia Kokosalaki designed one more collection for the label before to be replaced in May 2007 by Marc Audibet, in an unexpected move from the house.
Marc Audibet, appointed as artistic advisor, presented its sole and unique collection for the house in October 2007. In her review of the collection, Suzy Menkes, fashion editor of the "International Herald Tribune", stated: ""Audibet has deeply understood the essence of Madeleine Vionnet.""
From 2008, Vionnet collabored with a pool of designers, without revealing their identities. Arnaud de Lummen told "Women's Wear Daily" that he wanted the focus to be on the label's expansion and not on the fame of its designers: ""Vionnet doesn't need to be associated with a designer's name, it's an institution."" To support such expansion, de Lummen approached several investors and one of them, Matteo Marzotto, eventually became a buyer. After initiating Vionnet's revival and heading the relaunch house, Arnaud de Lummen became an expert in reviving long dormant brands; he initiated Moynat's revival and acquired rights in sleeping beauty fashion brands such like Paul Poiret and Mainbocher.
From 2006 to 2008, Vionnet was established at 21, Place Vendôme in the former premises of Madeleine Chéruit and Elsa Schiaparelli. Vionnet produced made-in-France "demi-couture" collections closed to haute-couture in the prices featured and the techniques and textiles used. Vionnet involved historical partners of the house, such as the couture embroiderer Maison Lesage.
2009-2011 - The Marzotto Era.
On February 24, 2009, Matteo Marzotto announced the acquisition of the label and the creation of a new and independent structure in Milan where Vionnet is now operated. Matteo Marzotto, former General Manager and President of Valentino SpA, is one of the heirs of the Marzotto Group, a powerful textile group established in Italy since 1836. Matteo Marzotto also announced that some additional strategic development is to be provided by Gianni Castiglioni, CEO of the fashion brand Marni.
Rodolfo Paglialunga, formerly from Prada, became the new creative director of the house, introducing his first new collection in October 2009. In September, 2011, Vionnet announced that twin sisters Barbara and Lucia Croce as creative directors, replacing Rodolfo Paglialunga
In December 2011, Vionnet unveiled its first directly owned stored in Milan.
Under the leadership of Marzotto, the list of celebrities dressed by Vionnet included Zoe Salanda Diane Kruger, Madonna, Natalie Portman, Carey Mulligan, Emma Watson, Hilary Swank, Marion Cotillard, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Carey Mulligan, and Cameron Diaz.
Since 2012 - The Ashkenazi Era.
In May 2012 Goga Ashkenazi purchased a majority stake in the business before to take full control of the label in November of the same year.
From August 2012, Goga Ashkenazi replaced the Croce sisters and assumed the creative direction of the label. In October 2012, she celebrated the 100 Years of the brand with a demi-couture collection paying homage to the house's signature design. 
In early January 2014, Vionnet announced to have tapped Hussein Chalayan to design the brand's demi-couture line. A first show took place on January 21, 2014. At the same time, Vionnet launched an advertising campaign shooted by Jean-Paul Goude.

Kay Wehner

Kay Wehner (born July 12, 1971) is a German former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
Career.
Wehner began his career with his hometown club, Stahl Eisenhüttenstadt, and was on the fringes of a team that reached the final of the last ever East German Cup, losing to Hansa Rostock but qualifying for the 1991–92 Cup Winners' Cup because Rostock were also league champions. Stahl qualified for the third tier of German football, the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, and it was at this level that Wehner made his first-team breakthrough. He helped the club qualify for the new Regionalliga Nordost in 1994, before leaving for Energie Cottbus a year later.
Wehner began as backup to Antonio Ananiev, but took over as first-choice when Ananiev joined 1. FC Köln early in the 1996–97 season, a season that would prove to be the best of Wehner's career. Cottbus won the Regionallihga Nordost, and beat Hannover 96 in a playoff to earn promotion to the 2. Bundesliga. They also reached the DFB-Pokal final, losing against Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart.
Wehner was ever-present in Cottbus's first season in the second division, but suffered a cruciate ligament injury in the summer of 1998 which saw him lose his place to the new arrival, Tomislav Piplica. Wehner returned to the Regionalliga Nordost, signing for 1. FC Union Berlin, where, despite the team winning the division, Wehner struggled for popularity, having replaced a club legend on Oskar Kosche. He missed the decisive penalty in a shoot-out in the promotion playoff against VfL Osnabrück, and Union would miss out on promotion to LR Ahlen in the final playoff round.
Union would earn promotion the following year, and match Cottbus's archievement in reaching the cup final, but Wehner had left the club by then, having been usurped by new signing Sven Beuckert he joined Regionalliga Süd club Wacker Burghausen in January 2001. In his second season with the club, Burghausen won the Regionalliga Süd and promotion to the 2. Bundesliga. He spent two seasons as first-choice at this level, before being replaced by the experienced Uwe Gospodarek in 2003. He had a brief run back in the team at the end of the 2003–04 season, this would be his last taste of first-team action, but he remained at Burghausen as a reserve 'keeper until 2007.

Thomas Fich

Thomas Fich, Fych or Fyche (died 1517), was an Irish ecclesiastic and compiler.
He studied at Oxford, became a canon regular, and was appointed sub-prior of the convent of the Holy Trinity at Dublin, now the cathedral of Christ Church. Of that establishment Fich compiled a meagre necrology in Latin, styled ‘Mortilogium’ or ‘Obitarium.’ He was also the compiler or transcriber of a collection of memoranda, chiefly on ecclesiastical matters, known as the ‘White Book of Christ Church, Dublin,’ still preserved in that cathedral.
The necrology was printed at Dublin by the Irish Archæological Society in 1844, with an introduction by James H. Todd, D.D. A reproduction of a page of the ‘White Book of Christ Church’ was given on plate i. of part iii. of ‘Facsimiles of National MSS. of Ireland,’ published in 1879. Fich died at Dublin in 1517, and was interred in Christ Church there, to which he had been a considerable benefactor. He would appear to have been related to Geoffrey Fych, dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin, 1529–37. In that cathedral is still extant a brass plate bearing the effigy of Geoffrey Fych and a monumental inscription.

Bai Zijian

Bai Zijian (; born 16 October 1992 in Shenyang, Liaoning) is a Chinese footballer of Korean descent who plays for Changchun Yatai in the Chinese Super League.
Club career.
Bai Zijian is an ethnic Korean Chinese who would predominantly concentrate on his studies before moving into football where with the help of a family friend and former professional footballer Wang Chao, he was able to enroll with second tier football club Shenyang Dongjin's youth team. Very little would come from his period with Shenyang, however he would be scouted by the Chongqing Lifan manager Li Shubin who was impressed by Bai and would sign him as a youth player. Despite joining a top tier football club and being promoted to the first squad, Bai actually saw no playing time throughout the entire 2010 season. Often spending most of the season as a translator for teammate Cho Se-Kwon, Bai's time at the club was cut short when Li Shubin was sacked due to a poor run of results and Bai was surplus to requirements at the end of the season.
Almost giving up on football and returning to his education, Bai was persuaded to go to a training session held in Guangzhou for K-League side Daejeon Citizen and impressed the team's manager Wang Sun-Jae who would sign the player on 14 February 2011 after a successful trial. He made his debut for the club on 6 March 2011 in a league match against Ulsan Hyundai, coming on as a substitute for 90th minute in a 2-1 victory. After a one-year stint, Daejeon made a decision to not extend his contract. He then joined South Korean second division club Goyang KB in February 2012 and received little playing time at the club throughout the season.
Bai left Goyang KB to join Chinese Super League club Changchun Yatai for the 2013 season. He made his league debut on 5 October 2013 against Guangzhou R&F in a 1-0 away defeat.

Herschel Leibowitz

Scholar, educator, and philanthropist Herschel Leibowitz is widely recognized for his research in visual perception and for his symbiotic approach to conducting research that both advanced theory and helped in the understanding and relief of societal problems. His research on transportation safety included studies of nearsightedness during night driving, vision during civil twilight, an illusion that underlies the behavior of motorists involved in auto-train collisions, susceptibility of pilots to illusions caused by visual-vestibular interactions, and the design of aircraft instrument panels.
Life, education and career.
Herschel Leibowitz was the only child of Lewis and Nettie Wolfson Leibowitz. He was born and raised in York, Pennsylvania and attended school in York. He later earned his B.A. at the University of Pennsylvania and M.A. (Experimental Psychology) and Ph.D. (Physiology) at Columbia University.
Leibowitz’s early studies at University of Pennsylvania were interrupted by World War II. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, 75th Infantry Division, European Theater, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He studied at the Sorbonne after his military service, and then resumed his studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He later earned his M.A. (Experimental Psychology) and his Ph.D. (Physiology) from Columbia University under the guidance of Clarence Graham. Leibowitz’s dissertation explored the effect of pupil size on visual acuity for photometrically matched stimuli.
In 1949, he married the former Eileen Wirtshafter. They had two children, Marjorie (1950) and Michael (1953).
He began his career as a faculty member in the Department of Neurophysiology at the University of Wisconsin (1951–1960). Following this, Leibowitz was an advisory psychologist and manager of behavioral research at IBM (1960–1962). He returned to academia in 1962 as a member of the Department of Psychology at The Pennsylvania State University where he was named Evan Pugh Professor in 1977. He retired from Penn State in 1995.
By the time of his retirement in 1995 Leibowitz had published more than 250 articles in scientific journals and had been recognized as one of the most influential researchers in perception (White, 1987). He was also a tireless advocate for psychological science. Once when offering testimony to a Congressional committee, Leibowitz pointed out that the military was investing less annually in human factors research than the cost of a single aviation mishap despite the fact that the military was blaming many such mishaps on human error.
His extended family of former graduate students and colleagues gathered in State College on several occasions for LeiboFest celebrations of science, friendship, and mentorship. The book “Visual Perception: The Influence of H.W. Leibowitz” was written by his students and close colleagues in 2002; the book contains pearls of wisdom that continue to prove useful. In general, Leibowitz enjoyed bringing into the laboratory the visual challenges that are routinely faced by people in highly demanding situations.
Leibowitz also became an avid runner; he was 50 when he completed the first of his 15 marathons. You can read more about Hersh from his family, friends, colleagues and students on posterous and facebook.
Research.
Leibowitz’s research investigated basic issues of visual psychophysics, perception of size, distance & motion, peripheral vision and oculomotor functioning. He also studied problems of aviation, traffic safety, motion sickness, postural instability (especially during stair descent), and the effects of stress on perception. Indeed, one of the striking characteristics of Leibowitz’s research was his symbiotic view of “basic” and “applied” science. In the early 1970s, for example, Leibowitz’s lab developed the laser optometer and used it to advance our basic understanding of the eyes’ focusing behavior (visual accommodation); these “basic” experiments simultaneously addressed real-world difficulties such as night myopia (Leibowitz & Owens, 1978) and visual fatigue (Tyrrell & Leibowitz, 1990).
He also connected advances in visual psychophysics and neuroscience with a wide range of matters in health science, national defense, child development, and transportation safety. He proposed that the hazards of night driving, for example, can be better understood through the neurological concept of two visual systems, explaining drivers’ over-confidence at night as resulting from sustained efficiency of visual guidance combined with selective degradation of focal recognition abilities (Leibowitz, Shupert & Post, 1985).
A defining characteristic of Leibowitz’s approach to science was his enthusiasm for cultivating the development of younger scientists. He encouraged his graduate students to indulge their curiosity (“study what bugs you!”), while always insisting on attention to his favorite question “Why is that important?” Leibowitz loved inter-disciplinary collaboration and he built productive friendships with colleagues in fields ranging from anthropology to zoology, including athletics, biomechanics, health science, law, physiology, and physics.
Accomplishments.
Author.
Leibowitz is the author of more than 250 articles in scholarly publications, in addition to a book, "Visual Perception" (1965). In 2002, the book "Visual Perception: The Influence of Herschel W. Leibowitz" was written by several of his former students and published in his honor. Hersh always said that his greatest professional achievement was the number of students who passed through his classroom on their way to success in psychology and other fields. Over the years his former students have returned to Penn State to celebrate Hersh and his continuing influence on them.
Editor.
Leibowitz served on the editorial board of Psychological Research (1965–88) and Perception and Psychophysics (1969–93). He was a consulting editor for International Journal of Vision Research, Journal of Experimental Psychology, Psychological Bulletin, SCIENCE, Behavioral Research Methods and Instrumentation, Contemporary Psychology, Human Factors, and Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied.
Consultant.
He served in many government and public service roles, including consultant to the Veterans Administration, Gallaudet College, Institute for Defense Analyses, Department of the Interior, University of Michigan Infrared Physics Laboratory and Transportation Research Institute, Department of Defense, Institute for Environmental Medicine, Council of Graduate Schools, U.S. Air Force, Pennsylvania College of Technology, and Essex Corporation. He also served as an expert witness in cases involving crashes between motor vehicles and trains.
Among the other organizations he served are the National Science Foundation, National Research Council, American Psychological Association (chair, 1991–92; president of Division of Experimental Psychology, 1986–87), NATO symposiums on Image Evaluation and Motion Perception, National Institute of Mental Health, National Eye Institute, American Academy of Optometry, University of California at Berkeley School of Optometry, Aerospace Medical Association, Optical Society of America, Federal Railway Administration, and the American Federation for Aging Research.
He served on the U.S. Olympic Committee's Sports Medicine Division's Committee on Visual Performance and Safety. In 1983, he testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Sub-Committee on Science, Research and Technology, and in 1990, testified before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee for Defense.
Leibowitz's Law.
For all that he accomplished, however, Leibowitz’s scientific and personal philosophies will often be distilled down to a single maxim known as “Leibowitz’s Law.” Linking neuroanatomy, psychophysics, and everyday experience, Leibowitz’s Law is illuminating for its simplicity, for its accuracy, for its implicit request to honor simple truths, and for reflecting Leibowitz’s unique sense of humor. Leibowitz’s Law states that “You can’t see a damn thing in the dark!” It is a telling sample of Leibowitz’s unique approach toward science, education, and friendship.
Honors and awards.
Among his numerous honors, Leibowitz received the American Psychological Association’s Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award for the Applications of Psychology (1994), the American Academy of Optometry’s Prentice Medal (1987), Pennsylvania Optometric Association’s Van Essen Award (1987), and honorary Doctor of Science from the State University of New York (1991). He launched distant collaborations with the support of fellowships from the Guggenheim Fellowship (1957-58) for research at the University of Munich, Senior von Humboldt Fellowship (1976–78). In 1983, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.
He also served on the advisory board of the Pennsylvania Transportation Institute, Penn State Applied Research Laboratory, Center for Higher Education, National Society to Prevent Blindness, and Life-Sight Advisory Committee. In addition, he was active on the National Research Council Vision Committee, chairing numerous initiatives.
Leibowitz was a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Academy of Optometry, Human Factors Society, and Optical Society of America, and a member of the International Perimetric Society, Eastern Psychological Association, American Medical Athletic Association, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Society for Scientific Exploration, International Society for Ecological Psychology, American Psychological Society, and Sigma Xi.

Ann James

Ann James is an Australian author and illustrator of over 60 books for children. Born in Melbourne, Victoria Ann James has been illustrating books since the 1980s and has become a significant contributor towards the development and appreciation of children's literature in Australia. In 2000 she was awarded the Pixie O'Harris Award as a formal acknowledgment of this contribution and was also the 2002 recipient of the national Dromkeen Medal for services towards children's literature. Anne James currently still lives and works in Melbourne, where she runs the Books Illustrated gallery and studio that she co-founded with Ann Haddon in 1988.
Biography.
Ann James was born in Melbourne, Australia in October 1952, and grew up in the suburb of Ringwood. She attended Norwood Primary School and later, Tintern Girls School before entering teachers college in Melbourne. Training as an arts and crafts teacher, James first taught at both Doveton and Ringwood High School in Melbourne before being seconded to the Publications Branch of the Education Department of Victoria. It was here that she began to work as a graphic designer and illustrator of educational publications between 1978 to 1988.
During this time James began to independently illustrate children’s books, her first being, A Pet for Mrs Arbuckle, written by Gwenda Smyth, in 1981. As her career in books began to take off, (with 14 books published by 1988), James left the Department of Education and co-founded a gallery named Books Illustrated, dedicated to children’s book illustration. From this time onwards she has worked towards promoting Australian Children’s books, and continued illustrating books from her home in Melbourne, and her country studio, near Castlemaine, Victoria.
Career.
Many of James's books have won or been short-listed for the Children's Book Council of Australia book of the year awards, including "Bernice Knows Best", by Max Dann, (CBCA Junior Book of the Year, 1984) and "Hannah Plus One" by Libby Gleeson which won the same award in 1997. Also in 1997, "The Midnight Gang", by Margaret Wild, was a CBCA Picture Book of the Year Honor book, and went on to win three Children’s Choice awards around Australia. Books short-listed in the CBCA Awards included "Dog In, Cat Out", by Gillian Rubinstein; "Hannah and the Tomorrow Room", by Libby Gleeson; "Looking Out for Sampson", by Libby Hathorn; and "Penny Pollard’s Diary" and "Penny Pollard’s Letters" by Robin Klein.
In 1988 Ann James co founded a gallery and studio space in Melbourne called Books Illustrated with fellow book enthusiast Ann Haddon. This gallery has become a center for children's literature and children's book illustration and has exhibited the work of many prominent Australian illustrators including, Terry Denton, Shaun Tan and Leigh Hobbs. 
Ann James's illustrative work is part of the permanent collections of the Lu Rees Archives at University of Canberra, the Dromkeen Collection, Fremantle Children's Literature Centre, Seasons Gallery, and the Customs House Gallery.

Soviet air show

In the life of Soviet Union, air shows were a highly regarded type of parade, almost always of military nature. They happened on various occasions and anniversaries, in many locations across the country. A notable air show was the Tushino Air Show held annually in August.
Dates.
Soviet Air Fleet Day.
The most frequent date of air shows was the Soviet Air Fleet Day (). It was also known as the Soviet Air Forces Day (), or Soviet Aviation Day. It was established in 1933 and was most usually held on the third Sunday of August, weather permitting. The initial exhibition on August 18, 1933, was a result of Yakov Alksnis initiative, and was held in Gorky Park (Moscow) (the Central Moscow Aerodrome), but since the next year the show became located on Tushino airfield near Moscow, where it remained for entire decades. In 1937, the parade was attended by nearly a million people, observing the masses of aircraft spelling in the sky "LENIN", "STALIN" and "SSSR". The celebrations repeated until the fall of Soviet Union, and continue in Russia (location is now Zhukovskiy airport, see MAKS airshow).
May Day.
The 1st of May was dedicated to multitude of parades throughout the Soviet Union. They often included large-scale flypasts.
Other.
The Soviet Air Fleet Day became primarily associated with Soviet Air Forces (VVS), so a separate day has been established for Soviet Air Defense Forces (PVO) a second arm of Soviet military that employed numerous fighter squadrons. It was called Soviet Air Defense Forces Day (), occurred on the second Sunday of April, and was celebrated with air parades of lesser scale.
The October revolution anniversary usually included air parade, but as it was held on 7 November, the aircraft were often cancelled because of weather conditions. The same problem pertained to 19 November, the Soviet Rocket Forces and Artillery Day.
Notably, the 50th anniversary of October revolution air show was held in the summer, on 9 July 1967 at Domodedovo airport. In an unprecedented display of air power, it featured twelve new types or variants of military aircraft, and prompted concern in the West.
Notable first appearances.
The Soviet air shows conveyed more than entertainment. In the atmosphere of harshly enforced clandestinity, these air shows were frequently the main source of information about the recent aviation achievements of Soviet design bureaus (OKBs). Both Eastern and Western public opinion benefited from it, as well as foreign military intelligence.

Aston Martin AMR-One

The Aston Martin AMR-One was a Le Mans Prototype sports car built by Prodrive's Aston Martin Racing arm. The car is a successor to the B09/60 which was a collaboration between Lola and Aston Martin. Unlike their diesel competitors Aston Martin had gone for an open-top LMP.
Development.
To meet the new regulations brought in by the ACO for endurance racing, the AMR-One is powered by a downsized, 2.0 litre turbocharged straight six petrol engine, which features a blade-fin behind the cockpit. The AMR-One is built around a light carbon fibre monocoque chassis with open top bodywork, as opposed to the Peugeot-Audi trend of closed car. 
The Aston Martin has a very high belt-line, broad shapes and few surface breaks. The front of the car is designed to develop minimal downforce and to force as much air into the ducts. The air then moves through the car instead of over the top. There are numerous ducts inside the high bodywork, one for brake cooling, two through the side vents and one for rear gearbox cooling. One air scoop is in place to feed the turbocharger. Two side ducts on the rear of the car are for rear-brake cooling. The exhaust exits at the bottom of the vertical fin.
Racing History.
2011.
Six AMR-Ones were expected to be built, with Aston Martin Racing participating in several international endurance events in 2011, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the 6 Hours of Castellet, the new AMR-One qualified 5 seconds behind the Pescarolo. In the race things took a downturn and the AMR-One finished way down the order. Further problems continued as they only completed a handful of laps at the Le Mans Test Day and were far slower than the top running LMP1 cars. The poor testing was followed by their withdrawal from the 1000 km Spa in order to continue private testing for Le Mans. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the #009 car retired after only two laps, whilst the #007 car spent four hours in the pit before officially retiring, having driven only four laps. Aston Martin decided to skip the Imola round in favour of developing the car, earning them 3 DNS in 4 races and no points. At the 1000 km of Silverstone, Aston Martin dropped the AMR-One and replaced them with their older but much faster Lola-Aston Martin B09/60.
Two of the AMR-One chassis were later sold to other programs. The DeltaWing project utilized an AMR-One chassis for the base of its radical design due to the team not needing to rehomologate a chassis which had already passed safety tests. A second AMR-One chassis was sold to Pescarolo Team for their use in developing the Pescarolo 03 LMP1 chassis.
Demise.
In January 2012 Aston Martin Racing announced they were ceasing development of the AMR-One and instead focusing once again on their GT program. Racing driver Darren Turner blamed the public development of the AMR-One as its undoing citing that most teams develop their new cars completely behind closed doors for at least a year before attempting to race with them.

Wyresdale Park

Wyresdale Hall is a country house located to the northeast of Scorton, Lancashire, England.
History.
It was built in 1856–58, and designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley for the Ormrod family of Bolton. It has since been extended and outbuildings have been added. The hall is in Gothic Revival style. A lake was added to the grounds in 1897. The hall and surrounding parkland were purchased in the 1920s by the Riddell family, and the farms and fell land by the Whewell family. In 1967 the hall was also bought by the Whewells. By the 2000s the hall continued to be in a satisfactory condition, but the outbuildings were in a poor state and the gardens were overgrown. The family worked with Ruth Watson, and cooperated with the Channel 4's programme "Country House Rescue", creating a café and arranging Open Days. The hall and its surrounding outbuildings have been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.
The Ormrod Family.
Peter Ormrod (1796–1875) built Wyresdale Hall in 1856. The architect was Edward Graham Paley who designed many outstanding buildings in Lancashire. Peter was a banker and cotton manufacturer. His father James was one of the founders of the Bolton Bank (now the Royal Bank of Scotland) and on his death in 1825 Peter inherited the Partnership in the bank. In 1838 Peter married Eliza Hardcastle who was the daughter of one of his partners. On their marriage his father in law, Thomas Hardcastle gave him Halliwell Hall and Peter made major alterations to this house. He also provided the entire funding for rebuilding the parish Church in Bolton.
The couple had no children and therefore when Peter died in 1875 Wyresdale Park was left to his nephew James Cross Ormrod . However his wife Eliza was given a life interest in the house and she remained there until her death in 1890. When James Cross Ormrod died in 1895 his son Captain Peter Ormrod (1869–1923) inherited the Estate.
Captain Peter Ormrod was a very outgoing man and made major improvements to the property. His most outstanding achievement was the establishment of the Wyresdale Fishery which was said to be the largest in Europe (see photos below). Two feature articles were written in 1899 in the magazine “Country Life” about this Fishery. He also added a deer park and a lake to the estate. In 1899 it was widely reported in many newspapers that Peter had bought the whole of the fallow deer in Barningham Park the seat of Sir F. A. Millbank.
In about 1912 Dame Laura Knight visited Wyresdale Park with her husband Harold at the request of the then owner Captain Peter Ormrod. In her autobiography she mentions that during her stay she was inspired to paint “the grounds, the byres and the fells. One of these paintings was called “The Morning Ride” which depicts the fountain which still exists today in the grounds of Wyresdale Park. A link to this painting is given at this reference.

Diplazium molokaiense

Diplazium molokaiense is a rare species of fern known by the common name Molokai twinsorus fern. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is one of the rarest ferns. It has historically been found on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Lanai, Molokai, and Maui, but it is thought to have been extirpated from four of them and today it only exists on Maui. There are fewer than 70 individual plants remaining there. The fern was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1994.
Characteristics.
This fern has leaves up to about 20 centimeters long growing from a twisted rhizome. Each dark green, shiny leaf is made up of several pairs of leaflets, the largest of which is about 5 × 2 cm. They have pointed tips and slightly rippled edges. The sori are up to a centimeter long and are narrow and somewhat curved in shape.
Habitat.
This fern grows in the moist riparian forests on the slopes of two mountains on Maui, one of which is the volcano Haleakalā. It can be found next to streams lined with basalt boulders and near waterfalls and plunge pools. The forest in the area has a mostly open canopy and is dominated by ʻōlapa ("Cheirodendron trigynum") and ʻōhiʻa lehua ("Metrosideros polymorpha"). Other plants of the understory include Ākala ("Rubus hawaiensis"), Kanawao ("Broussaisia arguta") and "Coprosma" species. The fern grows from walls of mossy rocks alongside other ferns such as "Pteris cretica", "Polystichum haleakalense", "Pneumatopteris sandwicensis" and "Diplazium sandwichianum".
Endangered status.
Threats to this rare fern include habitat destruction and degradation due to the action of feral pigs, flash flooding, and invasive plant species such as Australian blackwood ("Acacia melanoxylon"), sticky snakeroot ("Ageratina adenophora"), sweet vernal grass ("Anthoxanthum odoratum"), fringed willowherb ("Epilobium ciliatum"), velvet grass ("Holcus lanatus"), and cat's ear ("Hypochoeris radicata").

Stuck Between Stations

Stuck Between Stations is a 2011 romantic drama film, directed by Brady Kiernan from a script by Nat Bennett and Sam Rosen. The film tells a coming-of-age story about former high school classmates reunited by chance during a chaotic party-filled evening.
"Stuck Between Stations" premiered as an official selection of the Viewpoints section at the SVA Theater at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, New York, U.S.A. A NYC theatrical release was slated in November 2011.
Plot.
A decade after they graduated from high school and went their separate ways, Casper (Sam Rosen), a soldier haunted by the horrors of war, and Rebecca (Zoe Lister Jones), a whip-smart graduate student with a shaky future, reunite by chance and get to know each other over the course of an accidental tour of the little-known underbelly of Minneapolis. The evening's odyssey includes a bar fight, a house party, a punk-rock circus, a spontaneous burglary, a home Casper did not know he had, and a cast of strange characters, unexpected allies and disappointing friends.
Production.
"Stuck Between Stations" is produced by Spencer Kiernan and Todd Cobery for RKB Pictures. The film was shot mainly in Minneapolis. Principal photography began on October 2, 2009.

Rosen and his writing partner, Nat Bennett, were working on the screenplay for "Stuck Between Stations" and in March 2009 submitted it to Kiernan.
"Stuck Between Stations" is named after the opening track of The Hold Steady’s Boys and Girls in America album. “The title the film is mostly a reference to the spirit of the song,” Kiernan revealed in an 2009 interview. "This film is about those nights that we’ve all had where you meet someone, spend the whole night with them and start to maybe fall in love."

Tapeley Park

Tapeley Park is a Grade II* listed country house located near the village of Westleigh in Devon, England.
William Clevland, who went on to become King of the Banana Islands grew up here.
The house was acquired by the Christie family in the mid 19th century, who already owned Glyndebourne in Sussex. Later owners included John Christie, the founder of Glyndebourne Opera Festival. 
John Christie left Tapeley to his daughter, who passed it onto her nephew Hector Christie, who turned it into a hippie commune. In 2011, Tapeley Park was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her "Country House Rescue" series. By this time Hector Christie had put his hippie past largely behind him, and was concerned to restore the house and put it onto a sounder financial footing.

Les Surfs

Les Surfs was a Yé-yé-style pop group from Madagascar, that existed from 1963 until 1971.
History.
The eldest six of twelve children were Coco, Pat, Rocky, Dave, Monikya (Monique) and Nicole Rabaraona. Born in Madagascar the four brothers and two sisters performed as the vocal group "Les Surfs" from 1963 to 1971.
On October 14, 1958, they entered a singing competition held by Radio Tananarive under the name "Rabaraona Brothers and Sisters" performing two songs by The Platters, "Only You" and "The Great Pretender". They were awarded with first prize and then began performing under the new name "The Beryl". They toured Madagascar with Henry Ratsimbazafy and the CCC guitars and it was at this time they recorded their first 45's, "Little Flower", "Marin" and "The Three Bells".
On September 8, 1963, they appeared on the grand opening of the second television station in France. Their performance endeared them to the French public so Jean-Louis Rafidy, who was chaperone to the Rabaraonas while in Paris, urged them to sign a contract with Festival Records and release a single as soon as possible. With the release of "Reviens Vite Et Oublie" a cover of "Be My Baby", the group who were now named "Les Surfs" were at the top of the charts for three months in France and in Spain and Mexico with a Spanish version. They toured with Frank Alamo and Sheila and in 1964 they performed at the Olympia in Paris. It was here they were proclaimed the "Newcomers Of The Year".
They recorded and toured throughout the 1960s in languages and countries all over the world. Performances at San Remo secured them as a popular act in Italy, Spain and Germany. With further television appearances in France, Italy, England and America they garnered an international audience of millions. As a dynamic sounding and original looking group they secured many original compositions and some covers of English language songs.
With their career spanning from 1958 to 1971, they performed for royalty and common people alike. By the time the late 1960s had rolled around they had their own young families and so in 1971, at the end of a very long tour, Les Surfs decided to call it a day.
The following years would see Monica and Rocky reunite for a couple of years but this didn't last. The boys settled in Canada and started their own families. Monica lived in Canada for a while but eventually returned to live in France. Nicole immigrated to the United States and worked as a carer for children in need. Monikya died suddenly on November 15, 1993 at the age of 48. She is survived by her two sons Lawrence and Nicolas. Nicole died on May 5, 2000 and has been laid to rest with her sister in the Rabaraona Family tomb in Fiakarana, Madagascar.
In 2008, Dave Rabaraona started a new group "Les Surfs 2008" which participated in the French tour "Âge tendre et tête de bois 2008" during the 2008-2009 season. The line up of "Les Surfs 2008" included, in addition to Dave Rabaraona, Isa Rabaraona, Jackya Rabaraona, his cousin Bruno and Mahenintsoa Fidy.

Kamco

Kamco (Keane Australia Micropayment Consortium Pty) is the company formed in 2003 to tender for a new public transport ticketing system in Victoria, Australia. It was contracted to provide the myki ticketing system in 2005. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American company Keane Inc., and when the myki contract was awarded it described itself as "an alliance" of Keane Australia, Ascom, ERG, and Giesecke & Devrient Australasia (G&D), with Keane Australia providing "a single point of accountability" for Victoria's Transport Ticketing Authority.
Controversy in Victoria.
Procurement Process.
In April 2008, Vivian Miners, chief executive of the Transport Ticketing Authority, quit his $545,000-a-year job. After a report into the tendering process by Des Pearson, Victoria's Attorney General Rob Hulls found the tendering for the ticket system had been conducted properly. Mr Miners owned about $150,000 of shares in Headstrong, which was part of the Kamco consortium at the time it won the tender. Mr Miners' partner and former wife both worked for Headstrong and ERG, the Perth-based transport ticket company part of Keane. An early alleged draft of the report, leaked to the media in 2008, detailed a series of alleged conflicts of interest, probity issues, backdating of reports and favouring of the eventual winning bidder Kamco, a subsidiary of the American IT firm Keane.
The final report observed that "Keane had no corporate experience in developing, implementing and operating a ticketing system" and "barely demonstrated adequate capacity." The project has since gone over both time and budget limits.
Cash Injection required.
The Australian reported on 24 December 2007 that Kamco had requested a cash injection and wanted to change the contract to receive an accelerated payments schedule. To date Kamco has received $150m of the approx $750m spent.
Dispute with ERG.
Kamco sub-contracted installation and repair of myki equipment to ERG in an A$106 million contract which Kamco repudiated in June 2009. ERG separately sued Kamco, holding myki equipment hostage until "unpaid bills worth $1.8 million were settled", upon which Kamco launched a counter-claim in the Victorian Supreme Court.
January 2010 roll-out.
By early 2010, the state's political opponents were presenting figures alleging that "Melbourne has by far the most costly smartcard system in the world". The Labor Party's Public Transport minister Lynne Kosky attributed issues with the January 2010 roll-out to errors by Kamco, including "very silly mistakes" and "unacceptable" problems including a recall of 30,500 cards. Major operation problems included incorrect fare charging, cards that couldn't be activated and cards that wouldn't open entrance or exit gates.
Review into myki 2010/2011.
After the change of Government in the 2010 Victorian Election the incoming Liberal/National Coalition announced a "warts and all" review of myki by Deloitte. This report has yet to be released as of February 2011. Other companies have claimed they can provide alternative technical solutions at lower cost, but the Public Transport minister Terry Mulder said that it was not appropriate to consider these proposals until the Department of Treasury and Finance had costed the options in Deloitte's report. It could cost the government hundreds of millions of dollars to end its contract with Kamco early.

<doc id="31120699" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31120699" title="Habura (caste)">
Habura (caste)

The Habura are a Hindu caste found in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. They have scheduled caste status in that state.
Origin.
According to some traditions, the word "habura" has its roots in the Sanskrit "hawwa", which means an evil spirit. Their own traditions make reference to the fact that community are descended from Rajput soldiers. They were attempts to forcibly convert them to Islam, and as a result took refuge into the forests. The Habura then took up a nomadic existence, often also engaging in vagrancy. As a result, the British colonial authorities placed them in the category of a criminal tribe. After independence of India in 1947, they were denotified in 1952, when the Criminal Tribes Act was replaced with the Habitual Offenders Act, but the community continues to carry considerable social stigma.
Present circumstances.
The Habura are found mainly in the central Doab region of Uttar Pradesh. Most are found in the districts of Moradabad, Bareilly, Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Aligarh, Etah, Jhansi and Mathura. Although most Habura now speak Hindi, they have a particular dialect of their own known as Habura Bhasha. They are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy. Their main clans are the Dhobi, Makol, Parmar and Solanki.
Historically, the Habura were a nomadic community. Most now live in multi-caste villages, often working for Jat or Brahmin patrons. After their denotification as a criminal tribe, they were settled by the government in colonies, and given agricultural land. But these land holdings are extremely marginal, forcing many Haburas to become bonded labourers. This is known locally as "batai", where the sharecropper is forced hand over fifty percent of their produce. They are an extremely marganalized community, suffering from severe poverty.

ATLS.
Dr Gautam witnessed the inconsistent standards of care that were being delivered across the Emergency Departments across the country and decided that the implementation of the ATLS would be highly beneficial. This led to minimum qualifications for ED doctors and nurses being rolled-out across the UAE. In effect this has meant that when an injured patient lands in any ED, they can expect to receive the same high standard of initial medical intervention.
The ATLS Programme has become highly successful, in part to the dedication of the founders and faculty and the support that it has received from course attendees and the Ministry of Health in the UAE.
In spreading the ATLS Programme across the Middle East, India and Africa, Dr Gautam is ensuring that patient care is paramount, with predictable outcomes, using the most effective and efficient methods possible.
Continuing Medical Education.
Dr Gautam has demonstrated his commitment to the CME programmes in the United Arab Emirates over the last thirty years, by organising many of the regions foremost medical and surgical conferences.

Matthias Göring

Matthias Heinrich Göring (b. 1879-d. 1945) was a German psychiatrist, born in Düsseldorf. He died in prison in Poznan because he was an active Nazi.
He start his studies with a doctorate in law, and a doctorate in medicine at Bonn in 1907. Specializing in psychiatry and neurology he did a training analysis with Adlerian Leonhard Seif in Münich.
Like fellow Adlerians Seif and Fritz Künkel, Göring placed an emphasis upon "community feeling," to which he added German patriotism and Christian pietism. He was therefore critical of psychoanalysis for its alleged materialism and pansexualism.
Göring's significance in the history of psychoanalysis stems from his career after 1933. His position as leader of organized psychotherapy in Nazi Germany stemmed from the fact that he was an elder cousin of Nazi Hermann Göring. In part to protect the fledgling institution of psychotherapy against Nazi medical activists and university psychiatrists, Göring (who joined the Nazi party in 1933) preached against "Jewish" psychoanalysis and supervised the exclusion of Jewish psychoanalysts from his society and institute.
In 1934 Göring assumed leadership of the German General Medical Society for Psychotherapy and from 1936 to 1945 was director of the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy in Berlin. In 1938 he presided over the destruction of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute and the dissolution of the German Psychoanalytic Society, although also protecting and employing psychotherapists, Felix Boehm, and Carl Müller-Braunschweig, Harald Schultz-Hencke, and Werner Kemper. He was friend to Karen Horney.

Persoonia chamaepitys

Persoonia chamaepitys, commonly known as the prostrate- or mountain geebung, is a shrub endemic to New South Wales in eastern Australia. It has a prostrate habit, reaching only 20 cm (8 in) high but spreading up to 2 m (7 ft) across, with bright green spine-like leaves and small yellow flowers appearing in summer and autumn.
Taxonomy.
It was first described by Allan Cunningham in 1825. The origin of the type specimen is unknown. The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words "chamae" "ground hugging", and "pitys" "pine", from resemblance of the foliage to that of pines. Within the genus "Persoonia", "P. chamaepitys" is classified in the lanceolata group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur.
Description.
A prostrate shrub, "Persoonia chamaepitys" reaches to around 20 cm (8 in) high and spreads up to 1–2 m (3–7 ft) across. The new growth is hairy. The tiny spine-like leaves measure 0.7–1.9 cm long and 0.5–1 mm wide. Flowering occurs over spring and summer (October to January), the small yellow flowers arising from or near the ends of branchlets.
Distribution and habitat.
"Persoonia chamaepitys" is restricted to central New South Wales from the Upper Goulburn Valley south through the Blue Mountains and Woronora Plateau and into the Budawang Range. It is common around Katoomba to Mount Victoria. It grows at an altitude of 360 to 1100 m (1200–3600 ft), on sandstone-based soils in heath or dry sclerophyll forest. Those seen in the Blue Mountains seem to originate on a slope or mound.
Ecology.
Long-tongue bees of the genera "Chalicodoma" and "Hylaeus" and Eumenid wasps forage among the flowers, although only the long-tongue bee species "Leioproctus raymenti" is a pollinator. The fruit are eaten and scattered by vertebrates, such as kangaroos, possums, and currawongs and other large birds.
Cultivation.
The species is sometimes seen in cultivation, but has proven difficult to propagate from either seed or cuttings. It makes an attractive rockery plant, its bright green foliage and yellow flowers are features.
