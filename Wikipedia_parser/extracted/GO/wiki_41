List of Sharpe series characters

This is a list of characters in the "Sharpe" series.
Major d'Alembord.
Major Peter D'Alembord, nicknamed "Dally" joined the British Army after killing a man in a duel over a woman's favours. He is of French Hugenout extraction and enters the South Essex Regiment as one of Sharpe's many Light Company Subalterns. He becomes captain of the South Essex Light Company after Sharpe's promotion to major. After Napoleon's return from Elba, D'Alembord is also promoted to major as an inducement to rejoin the army. He is badly injured at the Battle of Waterloo and has to have his leg amputated. It remains unclear whether he survives the wound.
In the Sharpe television series, his only appearance is in "Sharpe's Honour", where he is portrayed by Edward Atterton, who received no credit for the part.
Lucille Castineau.
Lucille Castineau was Richard Sharpe's third (common-law) wife. She was born about 1786 to the Lassan family of Normandy. Her father was the Comte de Lassan, a minor aristocrat in possession of a large estate house and farm fallen on hard times. Lucille herself bore the title of Vicomtesse. Her father was killed during the revolution and was succeeded in his title by her older brother Henri Lassan. Her brother soon renounced his title in the face of further persecutions and later joined Napoleon's army as an officer. This left Lucille and her mother, the Dowager Countess, to run the estate. 
During the Napoleonic wars, Lucille married the son of a French general, a cavalry officer named Xavier Castineau. However, he soon after died in Russia, forcing Lucille to move back into the Lassan home. After his defeat by the British, her brother Henri also returned home and made arrangements to marry. Unfortunately, both Henri and her mother were murdered soon afterwards by thugs of French spymaster Pierre Ducos, trying to prevent Lassan from revealing Ducos's own treachery to Richard Sharpe. Lucille was left alone on the farm.
When Sharpe afterwards came to seek out her brother, Lucille mistakenly shot him with a large blunderbuss, wounding Sharpe. Realising her mistake, she took him and his friend William Frederickson in for several months. While Sharpe recuperated, Frederickson became interested in Lucille, but when he proposed, she turned him down. Frederickson left to pursue their original investigation and Sharpe took a hand in helping Lucille on the farm. During this solitude, Sharpe learned to speak French and the two became lovers (leading to Sharpe's permanent estrangement from Frederickson).
After travelling to Italy to defeat Ducos, Sharpe returned to the Lassan estate permanently. Lucille bore Sharpe a son, Patrick-Henri (named for her brother and for Sharpe's friend, Patrick Harper), who was still an infant at the time of the Waterloo Campaign. In 1820, Sharpe was still living on the farm with Lucille, who had born him a second child, a daughter named Dominique. Both children carried the Lassan name. According to his son, Sharpe and Lucille never married formally. Probably this was because Sharpe's English wife, Jane Gibbons, did not predecease him and he could not afford a legal divorce. Later in 1861, Patrick-Henri Lassan, by then Lieutenant-Colonel in the French Cavalry and liaison to the Union Army during the US Civil War in Cornwell's Starbuck Chronicles reported that Lucille was still alive and well but lonely - implying that by this time Sharpe is dead.
In the Carlton UK TV series, Lucille was portrayed by Cecile Paoli. However, in the original episode "Sharpe's Challenge," the series departed from the novels' continuity and reported that she had died of fever around 1817.
William Dodd.
William Dodd appears in the novels set in India near the start of Sharpe's army career. Although he is based on a real historical figure, his involvement in the Sharpe novels is entirely fictional. Dodd appears in the 2006 television revival "Sharpe's Challenge", portrayed by Toby Stephens. He also appears in the Simon Scarrow novel "The Generals" as the actual historical character.
The historical Dodd.
The real William Dodd was a lieutenant in the East India Company. In 1803, he was responsible for beating a native worker to death and was fined by the Company. Arthur Wellesley was outraged by the leniency of the sentence and demanded his dismissal, aiming to have him tried as a civilian for murder. Instead Dodd deserted to the Maratha army. Despite the offer of a seven hundred guinea reward for his capture, he was never seen again.
Dodd in the Sharpe novels.
Cornwell uses this backstory, adding the desertion of Dodd's entire sepoy company. Dodd is charged by the mercenary commander of the Mahratta army, Anthony Pohlmann, with raiding the British fort at Chasalgoan, where he massacres the entire garrison, with the single exception of Richard Sharpe. He is rewarded with a promotion to Major and command of a battalion, which he christens "Dodd's Cobras". Dodd escapes the British capture of Ahmednuggur. Shortly afterwards he encounters Sharpe with his mentor Colonel Hector McCandless and offers Sharpe a commission in his battalion. Sharpe is tempted to desert, but chooses instead to remain with McCandless when the Colonel is wounded during the theft of his horses by Dodd. Dodd survives Pohlmann's defeat at Assaye taking his Cobras with him. 
In "Sharpe's Fortress" Dodd has allied with Manu Bappoo and has been promoted to Colonel. Once again he survives defeat at the Battle of Argaum and withdraws to the mountain fortress of Gawilghur. There he makes plans to usurp power from his Indian employers. He welcomes Obadiah Hakeswill, an old antagonist of Sharpe's, when the former deserts, making him an officer in the Cobras. When the fortress is stormed by the British, Dodd betrays the Indian commander and locks the gates of the inner keep against both the retreating Indian defenders and the British assault force. Newly commissioned Ensign Sharpe leads a small force over the walls and traps Dodd on the ramparts. Dodd first kills Sharpe's young Arab servant, Ahmed, then almost defeats Sharpe in single combat, inflicting the facial scar which becomes Sharpe's most noted feature in later novels. He is only defeated and killed after the intervention of Sharpe's companion Sergeant Lockart.
Dodd in Sharpe's Challenge.
The Dodd of the television series is a British deserter but makes no reference to the real Dodd's back story. The film begins with the massacre at Chasalgaon in 1803 before skipping forward to the post-Waterloo period, circa 1817. By now, Dodd is the effective ruler of the region, being the lover of the regent Madhuvanthi. Dodd meets Sharpe and Patrick Harper when they arrive at his fort posing as deserters and offers them places in his army until he learns their true allegiance. He has arranged a mine to take care of the attacking British force but Sharpe and Harper manage to escape during the attack and set off the mine prematurely. Seeing his cause lost, Dodd kills Madhuvanthi and attempts to flee with the royal treasury but is confronted by Sharpe. A sword fight between the two men sees Dodd disarmed after which Sharpe forces him to sit on the throne he had coveted and skewering him through the chest with his sword, pinning him to it.
Pierre Ducos.
Pierre Ducos is a French secret agent and alongside Obadiah Hakeswill is Sharpe’s most bitter and persistent enemy through the later novels.
Ducos' exact origins are unclear. It appears he was born in France sometime in the 1770s, of fairly humble background. How he became involved in the world of espionage is not revealed, though he is described as a zealous revolutionary, and his rise occurred during the French Revolution of 1789 and the Terror that followed it. He was a protégé of Joseph Fouché, the notorious secret policeman of the revolutionary period. Following this he came into the service of the young General Napoleon Bonaparte, who was to crown himself Emperor of the French in 1804.
Until he first met Sharpe his schemes were largely successful and he is well regarded by his Imperial Master who entrusted him with matters of great importance, posting him to Spain to resolve what Napoleon described as the "Spanish Ulcer". As an example of his talent he is said to have bribed the Spanish commander of the strategic city of Badajoz to hand the keys of the garrison to the French. Ducos possesses a book listing a number of enemy officers, British, Portuguese and Spanish, whom he crosses out when they have been killed. He possesses a fervent hope that one day all the names in his book will be crossed out. Sharpe is already listed when their paths cross in 1812, during the events of "Sharpe's Battle" and in the following months Ducos comes to regard Sharpe as his nemesis, as the latter thwarts several plans to change the course of the war in Spain, particularly by defeating a surprise French invasion of Portugal in the winter of 1812, during which Sharpe had personally insulted Ducos and broken his spectacles ("Sharpe's Enemy"). In 1813 Ducos finally captures Sharpe and tortures him, destroying Sharpe’s telescope (a gift from Wellington) in retaliation for his own smashed spectacles. Sharpe is rescued by the intervention of a former lover, Helene Leroux and escapes after the accidental destruction of the castle.
In 1814, with acute foresight Ducos anticipates the fall of Napoleon and in its wake decides to betray the cause he has served so zealously for years. He steals the Imperial jewels and treasury, in the process implicating Sharpe in the crime and retires to the comfort of a villa in Naples. Unfortunately, he is once again bested by Sharpe, who escapes from custody, captures him and takes him back to Paris to face execution by firing squad; as with Hakeswill, Sharpe chooses to hand Ducos to the proper authorities for justice, rather than killing his enemy himself.
Personality.
Ducos is described as short, his face scarred by smallpox. Weak and timid when physically confronted, he claims to detest ‘unnecessary violence’ and is indifferent to the suffering of others. He is despised and feared by many of his colleagues, who nonetheless obey and respect him because of the enormous influence he wields. Until his final betrayal of Napoleon, Ducos seems entirely motivated by his dedication to the ideals of the French Revolution, continuing to use the French Republican Calendar long after it has been abandoned by his fellow countrymen ("Sharpe's Enemy"). He has no personal friends and shows no sexual interest in women or in men, although is not entirely asexual, as in "Sharpe's Battle" it is said that he visits prostitutes.
In the TV adaptations Ducos was played by Féodor Atkine.
Joseph Ford.
Joseph Ford is not a military man, but a wealthy landowner who purchases a commission as lieutenant colonel of the Prince of Wales Own Volunteers in the peace of 1814-1815, which he subsequently commands during the engagement at Quatre Bras and at the Battle of Waterloo. He is not confident in command and relies on the support of other under-experienced senior officers, Major Micklethwaite and Major Vine, both of whom are killed in the course of the campaign. Only the timely intervention of Richard Sharpe and his fellow Peninsula veteran, Major Peter d'Alembord saves the regiment from the twin threats of the incompetent command of the Prince of Orange and an attack by Napoleon's Imperial Guard.
In the television adaptation, he was portrayed by Shaughan Seymour.
William Frederickson.
William Frederickson comes from Westphalia. Nicknamed 'Sweet William' by his men, Frederickson has suffered a serious facial wound which has destroyed his left eye, broken his jaw, knocked out several teeth and caused nerve damage giving him an uncontrollable and permanently smug look. When fighting he takes out his false teeth (taken from dead French soldiers) and removes his wig and eye patch, to terrifying effect. He is however a cultured and sensitive man, with an informed knowledge of European architecture. He is of German and English descent and speaks both languages fluently, as well as competent French in "Sharpe's Siege". He is a close and loyal ally of Sharpe until the fallout over the affections of Lucille Castineau, who rejects Frederickson's proposal of marriage before taking Sharpe as a lover, which makes Frederickson angry at Sharpe, so he ends up leaving Sharpe. A discussion between Sharpe and Harper in the lead-up to the Battle of Waterloo indicates that Sweet William has been posted to Canada to serve in the War of 1812.
In the Sharpe adaptation, Frederickson was played by Philip Whitchurch. Instead of leaving Sharpe, he forgives him at the end of the episode.
Jane Gibbons.
Jane Gibbons (later Sharpe) is the second wife of Richard Sharpe. She is first mentioned in the very first Sharpe novel, "Sharpe's Eagle", in which Sharpe encounters her sadistic brother Christian. After Gibbons' death (at the hands of Sharpe's friend Patrick Harper), Sharpe finds he is wearing a locket containing a miniature of Jane, signed "God keep you. Love, Jane" and wonders if she knows what her brother was like. (Sharpe would wear the locket himself for some time afterwards before losing it while he was a prisoner of Ducos in "Sharpe's Honour".)
At some point in between "Sharpe's Gold" and "Sharpe's Company", Sharpe and Harper met Jane off-page during a visit to England. She makes her full debut in the series in "Sharpe's Regiment" where Sharpe and Harper encounter her again while back in England investigating the apparent disappearance of the South Essex Regiment's Second Battalion. The battalion is being used for illegal soldier auctions by Jane's uncle Henry Simmerson, an old enemy of Sharpe's. Jane herself is eking out a miserable existence in Simmerson's country house, unwillingly engaged to the battalion's arrogant and incompetent commander Bartholomew Girdwood. She explains to Sharpe that her parents died when she was thirteen and she went to live with Simmerson and his wife, her mother's sister. Since her father was a commoner, Simmerson considers her an embarrassment and keeps her away from high society. After Sharpe puts an end to the auctions, he takes Jane back to Spain with them where they marry.
Jane plays only a small role in the following novel, "Sharpe's Siege" in which Sharpe is alarmed to discover she has been visiting his friend Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Hogan, who is sick with fever and fears she has been infected. When he returns from the mission that is the main focus of the book, he finds he was mistaken.
The following book, "Sharpe's Revenge", sees a major change in Jane's character. With the Peninsular War nearing an end, Sharpe sends Jane back to England to procure a house in the country. Disliking the idea, she instead buys an expensive and gaudy London town house and is seduced by the wealth of high society previously denied her. When she hears Sharpe has been arrested on suspicion of theft, she initially tries to help him but when it appears he has murdered Commandant Lassan, a man who might have given evidence against him, she sees it as license to begin an affair with Lord John Rossendale. The affair is discovered by Harper and Peter D'Alembord when they come to Jane with a message from Sharpe, during which Jane gleefully watches as Rossendale horsewhips Harper. When Sharpe's name is cleared, Jane and Rossendale are fearful he will come looking for him, not least because Jane has withdrawn a large sum of money from his account.
Jane accompanies Rossendale to Belgium in "Sharpe's Waterloo" but finds herself shunned by society since she is only Rossendale's mistress. She attends the Duchess of Richmond's ball with him where they have a violent encounter with Sharpe. She then encourages Rossendale to kill Sharpe using the confusion of battle so that they may marry. She has not told anyone that she is pregnant with Rossendale's child, an idea that appalls her. At the end of the book, she is left to await the news of Rossendale's death at Waterloo.
The fate of Jane and her child is unknown, although she is referred to as still being alive at the time of "Sharpe's Devil". In his book "The Sharpe Companion", Mark Adkin claims Jane died in 1844, presumably of natural causes, but this has not been confirmed in any novel.
Television.
In the Sharpe's television series, Jane is played by Abigail Cruttenden. Her character arc stays very close to that of the novels. She and Sharpe are familiar with each other in "Sharpe's Regiment" but she has not been mentioned previously and how they met before is never stated: although her brother appeared in the television version of "Sharpe's Eagle" he is not mentioned there and indeed their relationship is never explicitly confirmed (although it can be inferred from their shared surname and uncle in Simmerson). In "Sharpe's Siege", Jane does contract fever, rather than Sharpe merely fearing she has and is already ill when he leaves (here she visits Major-General Ross rather than Hogan, who had already left the series). When he returns he finds she recovered thanks to Wellington acquiring some quinine from the Spanish. In this episode she is also seen working as an assistant to the regimental surgeon, Kenefick and her wedding to Sharpe, unlike in the books, occurs onscreen towards the beginning. In "Sharpe's Revenge", Jane's betrayal of Sharpe is partly motivated by his breaking a promise to not fight again after Toulouse when he challenges Colonel Wigram to a duel.
In addition to the television adaptations of the four novels she appeared in, Jane is present in two stories unique to the television series. In "Sharpe's Mission", set after "Sharpe's Siege", she is shown to already be disenchanted with the soldier's life that seems destined to always be Sharpe's lot and is easily seduced by the arrival of the superficially cultured poet Shellington. She appears to contemplate an affair with him in Sharpe's absence but sees through him when Harris reveals that the poem he has supposedly written about her is plagiarised and reconciles with Sharpe at the end. In "Sharpe's Justice", Jane accompanies Rossendale to a property left for him by a recently deceased aunt and in doing so encounters Sharpe, who is in the area commanding the Scarsdale Yeomanry (ironically, a position assigned to him by Rossendale's connivance in order to keep him away from London). Jane and Rossendale seem eager to take advantage of Sir Willoughby Parfitt's schemes to bankrupt and buy out mills but fail when Sharpe exposes his methods. Afterwards, Jane tells Sharpe that Rossendale will obtain him release from his post in exchange for him leaving them alone.
In "Sharpe's Waterloo", as in the novel, Jane travels to Belgium with John. She is shunned for being the wife of another man and when Sharpe turns up, he disgraces her at a ball, calling her a whore. Jane convinces John to kill Sharpe at Waterloo but he is killed before he can do so.
Bartholomew Girdwood.
Bartholomew Girdwood is a British Army officer, the nominal commander of the South Essex Regiment's Second Battalion and later the first Commanding Officer of the Regiment after its renaming as the "Prince of Wales' Own Volunteers."
Girdwood served as a junior officer in Ireland during the United Irish rebellion of 1798. While on patrol he became lost and was ambushed. The court of inquiry at Dublin Castle dismissed him on half pay, effectively ending his military career. Some 10 years later Girdwood was recruited by Sir Henry Simmerson to command Second Battalion of the South Essex Regiment, a cover for an extensive financial fraud and crimping scheme. Girdwood is also betrothed to Simmerson's orphaned niece, Jane Gibbons. The scheme is discovered in 1813 by, Major Richard Sharpe, when he returns to England seeking reinforcements for the Regiment's First Battalion in Spain. With the help of Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick Harper, Sharpe, under an assumed identity, tracks the South Essex's recruiting parties to a secret training camp on Foulness island, where he observes the new recruits being brutalised, cheated and auctioned to other, less popular regiments. When Harper intervenes to protest the summary execution of a deserter, he and Sharpe are hunted through the Foulness marshes by Girdwood and his fellow officers. Sharpe returns to the camp and removes Girdwood from command. Girdwood escapes and Sharpe attempts to follow his trail to evidence that will implicate Simmerson and his allies in Government. After discrediting Simmerson and saving the Battalion, Sharpe retains Girdwood as the nominal commander of the South Essex. On his first experience of battle, a relatively minor engagement in the Pyrenees, Girdwood suffers a complete mental breakdown and is invalided home.
Girdwood is punctilious in his dress and military protocol, modelling himself on the reforming military king Frederick the Great of Prussia, to the extent of stiffening his moustache with hot pitch. He harbours irrational fears of the Irish and of dogs and writes poetry which glorifies the art of war. The contrast between his image of himself as a great military leader and the reality of battle leads to his breakdown.
In the TV adaption, Girdwood was played by Mark Lambert.
Daniel Hagman.
Rifleman Daniel Hagman is a former poacher from the county of Cheshire, who enlisted to avoid imprisonment or transportation. He is the oldest man in Sharpe's company and, over the entire course of the novels, its best shot. Hagman is one of the Chosen Men.
Hagman is discharged from the army in 1814 and features as a civilian in the original TV episode "Sharpe's Justice", which is not based on the novels. He then re-enlisted at the start of the Hundred Days campaign, with the rank of Sergeant. He and Rifleman Harris are the last of the original 95th Rifles rescued by Sharpe in 1809 ("Sharpe's Rifles") to fight with Sharpe, but are killed at Waterloo in 1815. 
In the TV adaptations he was played by John Tams, a noted English folk musician and composer, who arranged and sang much of the music used in the series.
Obadiah Hakeswill.
Obadiah Hakeswill is a fictional character who appears in several of the Sharpe books by Bernard Cornwell.
Biography.
Early life.
Hakeswill's early history is related in every novel in which he appears. He was raised by his mother, Biddy, in an unknown "dale" town in England. His mother died when he was eleven and a year later he sexually assaulted a parson's daughter. To protect the girl's reputation he was charged and convicted of stealing a sheep and sentenced to death by public hanging. On the day of his execution, the hangman hoisted the numerous victims into the air to die by strangulation, for the amusement of the crowd and paid little attention to the small boy struggling at the far end of the scaffold. When a heavy rainstorm scattered both executioner and crowd, Hakeswill's uncle was able to cut the boy from the scaffold "for his mother's sake". Hakeswill fled south and enlisted in the 33rd Regiment of Foot as a drummer boy. 
As a result of this close encounter with death, Hakeswill was convinced that he was unkillable and protected by God and the spirit of his mother. He extended this reverence to mothers in general, "Mothers were sacred... Mothers were Obadiah Hakeswill's guardian angels" ("Sharpe's Tiger") and in "Sharpe's Enemy", he protects his hostage Josefina LaCosta when she lies that she came to a church in the town of Adrados to pray for the health of her own mother. "Sharpe's Enemy" also hints that Hakeswill's mother was actually abusive of him before his hanging, but those memories have been eclipsed by his belief that she sent his uncle to save him.
The hanging left him with a thick dark scar around his neck and uncontrollable facial tics.
Army career.
Hakeswill gains promotion to Sergeant by brutalising the lower ranks and pandering to the whims and vanity of less experienced officers. Outwardly he is punctilious in his military routine and obsequious towards officers, who find him very useful for keeping order among their soldiers. Thus protected, Hakeswill is free to terrorize the soldiers in his units, forcing them to bribe him to avoid floggings for imaginary infractions and forcing their wives to have sex with him to protect their husbands.
In the early 1790s he recruits the young Richard Sharpe into the 33rd from a public house in Sheffield. 
In subsequent campaigns in Flanders and India, Hakeswill torments Sharpe, until in 1799 he conspires with Captain Charles Morris to have Sharpe flogged to death ("Sharpe's Tiger").
Although Sharpe escapes with "only" 202 of the assigned 2000 lashes after an intervention by Sir Arthur Wellesley, Hakeswill continues to pursue a vendetta against him for the next three years, during which he betrays Sharpe and Lawford to Tipoo Sultan ("Sharpe's Tiger"), falsifies a second assault charge and murders Sharpe's friend and mentor Hector McCandless ("Sharpe's Triumph"). He later kidnaps Sharpe and sells him to a corrupt merchant and finally deserts to join the turncoat William Dodd at Gawilghur in "Sharpe's Fortress".
Hakeswill reappears in Sharpe's life in 1812, in the novel "Sharpe's Company", as a Sergeant in the new draft of the South Essex Regiment, in which Sharpe has risen to the rank of Captain. He is quick to resume the vendetta, conspiring to have Sharpe's friend and ally Patrick Harper flogged and demoted and disarming Sharpe's remaining riflemen. He also attempts to rape Sharpe's wife, Teresa Moreno and plots to assault her during the sack of Badajoz, murdering Captain Robert Knowles in the process.
His evil finally exposed, Hakeswill deserts from the army once again, joining a band of cross-national deserters on the Portuguese border, led by the Frenchman, Deron, aka "Marshal Pot-au-Feu". He is captured by the now Major Sharpe during an operation to release hostages, but escapes to shoot and kill Teresa. Hakeswill surrenders to a French officer, Colonel Alexandre Dubreton who, disgusted by his actions, hands him back to Sharpe.
Hakeswill is finally executed by firing squad, the coup de grâce administered by the officer in charge, ironically being Richard Sharpe
Attempts on his life.
The novels record at least four unsuccessful attempts by Sharpe and/or Harper to kill Hakeswill, which lend weight to the latter's conviction that he cannot die:
However, it can be argued that the first three incidents are not serious attempts at murder; Sharpe is aware that the Tipoo's tigers are not invariably savage after seeing Colonel Gudin stroke one some days earlier; does not give the elephant the final command needed to crush Hakeswill; and is not familiar with the snake pit at Gawilghur. He is not aware at this time that Hakeswill has murdered McCandless and seems to prefer to torment the living Hakeswill with his own continued survival.
Only after the murder of Knowles and Hakeswill's threat to kill his infant daughter, does Sharpe seek Hakeswill's death and even then choses to bring him to justice within the formal structures of the British Army. He feels that Hakeswill has victimized so many people that their families deserve to know that Hakeswill died after a fair legal process.
Author Bernard Cornwell has admitted that he regrets finishing the character off, as he has struggled since to create an antagonist of equal depravity and energy.
Sharpe TV series.
In the TV adaptations, Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill was played by Pete Postlethwaite. 
In "Sharpe's Peril", set in 1817, it is revealed that Hakeswill has a surviving son, Barabbas, played by Amit Behl.
In video games.
In the popular post-apocalyptic role playing game "Fallout 2", a character by the name of Obidiah Hakeswill resides in the town of Redding. In the side quest to aid the sheriff, you can choose to bring Obadiah to justice for cutting up the face of a prostitute. Besides their somewhat sociopathic nature, Obadiah and Obidiah share a scar around their necks and obsession with their mothers and a belief in their own invincibility.
Patrick Harper.
Regimental Sergeant Major Patrick Harper is a fictional character created by Bernard Cornwell in the "Sharpe" series of novels. 
Harper is a large, fierce-seeming man from Donegal, Ireland, recruited in the early years of the 19th century into the British Army and eventually the 95th Rifle Regiment. 
Harper is initially an antagonist, as he leads a mutiny against Sharpe's command and conspires to murder him ("Sharpe's Rifles"). Over the course of the series Harper becomes one of Sharpe's closest friends and his reliable companion, sharing most of his exploits and rising in rank beside him to sergeant and regimental sergeant-major. 
Along with Sharpe he is one of the principal protagonists of the series and appears in the majority of the books.
Career.
Patrick Harper was born in Tangaveane, County Donegal in 1784, one of many children born into a farming family in the Catholic peasantry that predominated in rural Ireland at the time. Hunger and rural poverty drove him to join the British army, despite his antipathy to the British in Ireland. 
This ambivalence at his role led to frequent rebellion against authority and a reputation as troublemaker, one of the wildest men in the army. Consequently he was transferred from regiment to regiment, until he settled in the newly formed 95th Rifles. 
Rifleman Harper got his first taste of battle when, in 1806, he was part of the disastrous attempt to capture Buenos Aires and the following year saw action at the Battle of Copenhagen ("Sharpe's Prey"). 
In 1808 the Rifles were posted to Portugal and fought in the opening campaigns of the Peninsula War, at the Battles of Rolica and Vimeiro. During the retreat to Corunna Harper was among a small group of Riflemen trapped behind enemy lines and led an unsuccessful mutiny against the only surviving officer - Richard Sharpe ("Sharpe's Rifles"). 
Harper's growing respect - eventually deep and lasting friendship - for Sharpe and his promotion to Sergeant finally provide Harper with a stability that allow him to flourish in the Army. He transfers with Sharpe to the South Essex Regiment, ("Sharpe's Eagle") and serves throughout the Peninsula War with great courage, a ferocious and adept soldier and natural leader of infantry.
Among the exploits he shares with Sharpe, Harper is credited with the capture of a French Imperial Eagle at the Battle of Talavera in 1809 and storming of one the breaches at Badajoz in 1812 ("Sharpe's Company").
He is discharged from the Army in 1814, but is present at the Battle of Waterloo as a civilian ("Sharpe's Waterloo"). 
He enjoys a successful second career in Dublin as a horse dealer (many of which are stolen) and owner of a public house.
Character and relationships.
Despite his ferocity in battle, where he seems to embody the berserker energy of legendary Irish heroes such as Cú Chulainn, Harper is a kind and gentle man, with a passion for birdwatching. His weapon of choice is a hugely powerful seven-barrelled Nock gun, given to him by Sharpe as a "Christmas present" ("Sharpe's Gold").
Harper is flogged during the siege of Badajoz as a result of the machinations of Sharpe's enemy Obadiah Hakeswill. Harper and Sharpe develop a more intense bond of friendship as a result.
Harper protects Isabella, a young Spanish girl, through the horrific hours of rape and looting that follow the fall Coimbra to the French. They subsequently marry and settle in Dublin, where they raise many children.
Harper speaks fluent Irish, his native tongue.
Sergeant Harris.
Sergeant Harris is a fictional character from Bernard Cornwell's "Sharpe" series of novels, an alcoholic scholar who enlisted because of debt. 
In the TV series, he is a rifleman, one of Sharpe's "Chosen Men" or lance corporals and is played by Jason Salkey. In "Sharpe's Rifles", he claims to be from Wheatley, Oxfordshire. This is contradicted in the novel "Sharpe's Havoc", written after the television adaptations, where Harris tells Sharpe he is from Lichfield, "where Samuel Johnson came from".
He enjoys reading books, especially philosophy and is the intellectual member of the company. In the books the educated Rifleman was Isaiah Tongue, killed in "Sharpe's Gold".
He was eventually promoted to sergeant but was killed alongside his friend Sergeant Daniel Hagman at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In the books Harris is absent from the battle, though a different Harris appears.
His first name is never revealed in the series and in fact a joke is made of this in his final scene, with Hagman asking him what it is.
The character was named in tribute to Benjamin Randell Harris, of the 95th Rifles, whose memoir, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris, about his experiences during the peninsular campaign, was a major source for Cornwell's original research for the Sharpe novels (an audio version of the book was recorded by Salkey).
Michael Hogan.
Michael Hogan is a fictional character in the Sharpe series of novels by Bernard Cornwell, loosely based on the career of the historical Colquhoun Grant.
Career.
Hogan is a Royal Engineers officer — while the Purchase System still allowed many British infantry and cavalry officers to buy commissions in the early 19th century, all other British military branches, including the engineers, the Royal Navy and the Royal Artillery, promoted by seniority or merit. Unfortunately, this meant promotion was rather slow and Hogan is still a Captain in 1808, despite his long service and abilities. 
Born in Ireland of presumed Catholic ancestry, his life before he encounters Sharpe is rather unclear. It is implied that he has spent time in India and Gibraltar, before joining the British garrison in Lisbon in 1808 following the British capture of the Portuguese capital after the Battle of Vimeiro. He is employed by Arthur Wellesley in mapping the Portuguese border and it is here that he first meets Lieutenant Richard Sharpe, who is to become his friend and colleague ("Sharpe's Rifles").
Hogan is promoted to Major in 1809, and thereafter appears to head the British intelligence network in the Iberian Peninsula. This was at a time when there was no formal military intelligence unit and Hogan's role is a good illustration of the sort of ad hoc arrangements used by the British in the field in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 
Sharpe is frequently employed (with or without his men) to carry out small scale secret operations for Hogan - for example, destroying a bridge in "Sharpe's Eagle", capturing a renegade exploring officer in "Sharpe's Havoc", retrieving treasure vital to the war effort in "Sharpe's Gold", retrieving hostages in "Sharpe's Enemy" and uncovering or capturing French spies in "Sharpe's Battle", "Sharpe's Sword" and "Sharpe's Siege". 
Although Hogan's role as spymaster requires him to be at times both ruthless and duplicitous, he is a good friend to Sharpe throughout the series, often protecting him from official censure and advancing his career.
In 1814, in the last months of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan is fatally stricken by fever. Even in his final delirium he is able to warn Sharpe of the presence of a double agent and so foil plans by his French counterpart, Pierre Ducos, to lure Sharpe into a trap. Thus he fulfils his obligations as a friend and officer to the very end.
Hogan is addicted to snuff taking.
Irish heritage.
Hogan is clearly proud of his Irish heritage and for many years carried around a small box of earth around with him, so that if he died he could be buried in 'Irish soil' ("Sharpe's Battle"). 
However, unlike Sergeant Patrick Harper, Hogan does not wear his pride on his sleeve, nor does he demonstrate any anti-English sentiment. In the same novel he exhibits no qualms about arranging the assassination of Father Sarsfield, a nationalist Irish priest, who has been working as a French agent.
Hogan was portrayed in the TV adaptations by Scottish actor Brian Cox. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Cox was unable to reprise the role after the first two films and Hogan's character was subsequently merged with other exploring officers from the novels, particularly Major-General Nairn (Michael Byrne), Mungo Monroe (Hugh Ross) and Major-General Ross (James Laurenson).
Captain Robert Knowles.
Robert Knowles (? - 1812) is a fictional character in the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell.
Robert Knowles first appears in "Sharpe's Eagle" as an inexperienced Lieutenant in the Light Company of the South Essex Regiment. He is one of the handful of officers who sides with Lieutenant Richard Sharpe in his feud with Sir Henry Simmerson, quickly recognising Sharpe's abilities as a soldier and adopting him as a role model.
Knowles plays a significant role in the recovery of stolen Spanish gold behind enemy lines in "Sharpe's Gold" and is shortly afterwards appointed as Adjutant to Lt Colonel William Lawford, the South Essex's senior officer ("Sharpe's Escape"). 
By early 1812 Knowles has purchased a captaincy in 45th Regiment of Foot, but is on hand to assist Lawford when the later is seriously injured during the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo ("Sharpe's Company"). 
Knowles sympathises with Sharpe when he learns that his mentor has been demoted from Captain to Lieutenant and promises to protect Sharpe's lover, Teresa Moreno, who is trapped with her young child in the besieged city of Badajoz.
Subsequently Knowles takes part in a successful escalade of the castle at Badajoz (in this Cornwell has borrowed the real life achievement of a Lieutenant James MacPherson). He then seeks out Teresa, but is shot and killed by Obadiah Hakeswill.
Knowles does not appear in the TV adaptations of the Sharpe series; his role in "Sharpe's Gold" was abandoned when the script was first, then radically revised, following an injury to the actor originally cast as Richard Sharpe, Paul McGann. In "Sharpe's Company" the character is combined with that of Lieutenant Harry Price and it is Price who shot in the last minutes of the film, though his character re-appears in Sharpe's Waterloo.
Josefina LaCosta.
Josefina LaCosta is a fictional character in the "Richard Sharpe" novels by Bernard Cornwell.
History.
Portuguese by birth, LaCosta is to married a nobleman, Duarte, who has fled to South America with the Portuguese family, in the aftermath of the French invasion in 1808, abandoning his wife. She is however happy to find herself unencumbered and seeking a wealthy man to provide her with a life of luxury and excitement, attaches herself to Lieutenant Christian Gibbons, the nephew of Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson, commander of the South Essex Regiment.
Lt Richard Sharpe, temporarily attached to the South Essex, desires LaCosta, which fuels his growing feud with the arrogant Gibbons.
This breaks into the open after Gibbons and LaCosta come to blows over a game of cards; Gibbons claims that LaCosta "staked her body" on the next hand, then lost and refused to pay the debt, while LaCosta claims that she was winning and Gibbons attacked her. Sharpe steps in to protect LaCosta from Gibbons and his crony, John Berry and takes her into his protection. He is forced to borrow heavily from his friend, Major Michael Hogan to pay for her room and board. They become lovers.
Gibbons, smarting over Sharpe's brevet promotion to Captain, attempts to provoke Sharpe into a duel by raping and beating LaCosta. Sharpe takes revenge by killing both men in the confusion of the battlefield.
LaCosta deserts Sharpe for a wealthy cavalry officer, Claude Hardy, souring Sharpe's pleasure in his capture of the French Imperial Eagle, during the Battle of Talavera ("Sharpe's Eagle").
After Hardy is murdered by a treacherous band of Spanish partisans, in 1810, Sharpe seeks out LaCosta in Lisbon and discovers she has set herself up in business as a courtesan. He is happy to buy her services, despite his growing attachment to Teresa Moreno, his future wife ("Sharpe's Gold").
LaCosta reappears in 1812 as the supposed wife of Sir Augustus Farthingdale, a prominent British diplomat. Sharpe is detailed to rescue "Lady Farthingdale" when she is taken hostage by a gang of deserters led by Sharpe's nemesis, Obadiah Hakeswill, in a remote village on the Portuguese border.
When Sharpe discovers that a substantial French force is approaching the village, he blackmails Farthingdale into resigning command, by threatening to reveal the nature of the fake marriage and LaCosta's former profession.
With Farthingdale removed Sharpe is able to hold the border crossing against the French until reinforcements arrive, but in the last moments of the siege Hakeswill escapes and murders Sharpe's own wife, Teresa.
Sharpe is devastated by his loss, the more so because Teresa had caught him flirting with LaCosta only hours before her death. Meanwhile, Farthingdale returns home to England, deciding that LaCosta is too great a liability to him. When LaCosta writes, bitterly reprimanding Sharpe for his betrayal of her secret and the destruction of her financial future, Sharpe remains unmoved ("Sharpe's Enemy").
Television adaptation.
In the TV adaptation, Josefina LaCosta appears only in "Sharpe's Eagle", played by Katia Caballero. Several changes were made to her history which made her a more sympathetic character.
She is a widow, rather than separated and is courted in earnest by Lt. Gibbons (who, unlike his sadistic counterpart in the novels, is more of a clod), but is drawn to Sharpe, as a genuinely honorable man. When Gibbons attacks her after suborning her maids, she is protected by Sharpe but they do not become lovers, due to the presence of Teresa Moreno in the story, sometime before the couple meet in the novel continuity. Sharpe kills one of her attackers, John Berry, but not Gibbons, who is disgraced along with his Uncle, Sir Henry Simmerson, by the latter's cowardice during the Battle of Talavera. Josefina becomes attached to Captain Thomas Leroy, an American Loyalist on Simmerson's staff and another honorable soldier.
LaCosta does not appear in the television adaptations of "Sharpe's Gold" or "Sharpe's Enemy"; her role in that story is taken by an original character with a similar backstory and a previous liaison with Sharpe, Lady Isabella Farthingdale, played by Elizabeth Hurley. Ironically, although Sharpe does not commit adultery with LaCosta in the novel, he does sleep with Isabella Farthingdale in the film.
William Lawford.
Sir William Lawford is a fictional British officer and a character in Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books.
Lawford is the son of a Scottish mother and English father and raised near Portsmouth in Hampshire. He is a member of the gentry and is able, with the help of his maternal uncle, Hector McCandless, to purchase a commission as a Lieutenant in the 33rd Regiment of Foot. As McCandless is an officer in the East India Company, it is probable that Lawford joins the regiment, then under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Wellesley sometime after its arrival in India in 1796. He is posted to the light company under Captain Charles Morris and there meets Private Sharpe for the first time.
When McCandless, who acts as an exploring officer for the Company, is captured by the forces of the Tipoo Sultan, Lawford is tasked with his rescue and chooses Sharpe to accompany him, thus saving the latter from execution by flogging.
The pair infiltrate the city of Seringapatam and, posing as deserters, are recruited into the Tipoo's army. Lawford learns to rely on and trust Sharpe's instincts and experience as a soldier to ensure the success of their mission. Unfortunately they are betrayed by Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill and thrown into prison, where Lawford teaches Sharpe to read, using a single page of the Bible.
During the British assault on the city, Lawford and Sharpe escape and successfully detonate a mine built into the city walls, saving many British lives and ensuring a British victory.
As a result of this both men are promoted, Sharpe as a Sergeant, Lawford as Captain. Lawford is still in India at least as late as 1803, when his uncle is killed in the closing stages of the Battle of Assaye, but he returns at some point in the next six years.
In 1809 Lawford is part of the garrison of Dublin Castle in Ireland, but purchases a Lieutenant Colonelcy and transfers to Wellesley's staff in Portugal ("Sharpe's Eagle"). There he is reunited with Sharpe, now a Lieutenant in the 95th Rifles. During the Battle of Talavera Lawford is given command of the South Essex Regiment when its commander Sir Henry Simmerson attempts to flee the field, thus once again becoming Sharpe's commanding officer.
Lawford continues in that role until early 1812, when he is gravely wounded in the assault on Ciudad Rodrigo, loses his left arm and is invalided back to Britain ("Sharpe's Company").
Back in England Lawford dedicates himself to his family and political career. He is knighted and elected to parliament, seeking advancement through alliance with the ruling Tory administration. He attempts to use these contacts to extricate Sharpe from the scandals that threatens to destroy their old regiment ("Sharpe's Regiment").
Lawford is the South Essex's second Commanding Officer, preceded by Sir Henry Simmerson and succeeded by Colonel Brian Windham.
Thomas Leroy.
Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Leroy (17?? - 1813) is a fictional character in the Richard Sharpe series of novels by Bernard Cornwell. He is an American Loyalist serving as an officer in the British Army during the Peninsular War.
Thomas Leroy was born in Virginia to a relatively prosperous planter family at some point prior to the American War of Independence. As Leroy's family support the Crown, they fled first to Canada and then to Britain on the defeat of loyalist forces. In 1809, Leroy purchased a Captain's commission in the fictional South Essex Regiment, where he first meets Richard Sharpe in the novel "Sharpe's Eagle". During Sharpe's first mission with the South Essex, its officers quickly place themselves into one of two categories: inept, cowardly dilettantes, such as the regiment's Colonel, Sir Henry Simmerson and his nephew, Lt. Christian Gibbons and professional, or at least competent officers, such as Leroy, Major Forrest and the regiment's only veteran officer, Major Lennox.
Leroy remains with the South Essex throughout his military career, rising steadily in ranks through the Peninsular Campaign. He is present at the loss of the regiment's colours at the fictional engagement at Torrecastro and at the subsequent capture of a French Imperial Eagle at the Battle of Talavera in 1809. ("Sharpe's Eagle"), is severely injured in the breach at Siege of Badajoz in 1812, ("Sharpe's Company"), but recovers to take command of the regiment after the death of Colonel Windham shortly before the Battle of Salamanca in the same year ("Sharpe's Sword"). He dies in action at the Battle of Vittoria in 1813, leading the assault on the village of Gamarra-Mayor. 
Leroy is the last Commanding Officer of the South Essex, before its change of name to the Prince of Wales' Own Volunteers, commanded by Lt. Col Bartholomew Girdwood ("Sharpe's Regiment"). 
In the TV Adaptations, Leroy was played by Gavan O'Herlihy. The character appears only in the episode based on "Sharpe's Eagle".
Teresa Moreno.
Teresa Moreno (died 27 December 1813) is a fictional character in the novels of Bernard Cornwell. She is a Spanish partisan and the second wife of Richard Sharpe. Richard Sharpe was un-officially married to Mary Bickerstaff in Sharpe's Tiger
Teresa Moreno is the daughter of wealthy Spanish border landowner and one time partisan Cesar Moreno. She first appears in "Sharpe's Gold", in the aftermath of a French attack on the village of Casteljada, in which her brother Ramon is tortured and she herself raped. This, in addition to the earlier rape and murder of her mother by the French, fuels her desire for revenge and lead to her becoming a leader of a guerrilla force, with the nom de guerre "La Aguja", or "The Needle", after the stiletto knife which is her weapon of choice .
Sharpe takes Teresa hostage to ensure the safety of his men as they escape from the partisan El Catolico. They fall in love, despite Teresa's engagement to El Catolico and form an alliance which delivers to Sharpe the Spanish gold he has been tasked to collect and grants to Teresa leadership of the partisans.
The couple are separated for over a year, until Teresa finds Sharpe in the aftermath of the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo and reveals that she has given birth to their daughter Antonia, in the French held city of Badajoz ("Sharpe's Company").
The British are about to besiege the city and Sharpe is determined to be first over the wall to protect his new family. He is foiled by his bitter enemy Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill, who plans to rape and murder Teresa. Sharpe and his close friend Sergeant Patrick Harper only just arrive in time to prevent the crime. Teresa and Sharpe are married the next morning.
Eighteen months later Teresa and her partisans are involved with Sharpe in an operation to remove a murderous gang of deserters, including Hakeswill, from a remote mountain village. Hakeswill escapes and murders Teresa ("Sharpe's Enemy").
Her daughter is adopted by Teresa's brother, Ramon and, as far as is known, never meets her father again.
In the TV adaptations, she was portrayed by Assumpta Serna.
Charles Morris.
Captain Charles Morris is a fictional character in the Richard Sharpe novels by Bernard Cornwell and a significant antagonist in the hero's early career. 
Morris is a lazy, venal and corrupt officer in the 33rd Regiment of Foot's Light Company, replacing the more energetic and decent Captain Hughes after the latter's death from "the flux". He relies on the brutal Sergeant Obidiah Hakeswill to run the company and is easily drawn into peculation and other abuses of authority.
On the eve of the regiment's deployment against the Tipoo Sultan in 1799, Morris conspires with Hakeswill to frame private Richard Sharpe for assault, leading to a sentence of 2,000 lashes, a prolonged and agonising death sentence. Only the reluctant intervention of the Regiment's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Wellesley, prevents the flogging being carried beyond the 200th stroke ("Sharpe's Tiger").
Four years later Hakeswill is able to manipulate Morris into laying a further charge of assault against Sharpe, by knocking the Captain unconscious himself and dousing the officer with the contents of a full chamber pot ("Sharpe's Triumph"). This plot is foiled when Sharpe is given a battlefield commission as Ensign, after the Battle of Assaye and placed out of Hakeswill's power.
Morris makes one final appearance during the assault on the fortress at Gawilghur, when he refuses to lead a detachment of troops over the wall; Sharpe knocks him unconscious, leads the assault and so takes the fortress ("Sharpe's Fortress").
Little is known of Morris's subsequent career, until 1812, when Hakeswill joins the South Essex Regiment and informs Sharpe that Morris is part of the garrison of Dublin Castle in Ireland ("Sharpe's Company").
Author Bernard Cornwell has indicated that Morris is one of the story threads he has yet to complete.
Nairn.
Major-General Nairn (first name unknown) is a fictional character in the "Sharpe" series of novels written by Bernard Cornwell.He was a regular on the second series of the Sharpe television programme, in which he was played by Michael Byrne.
Character history.
Nairn first appears in "Sharpe's Company", where he orchestrates the assault on the fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo.
He makes his first major appearance in "Sharpe's Enemy", where he is in command of the British forces in Frenada whilst Wellington is in Lisbon. He informs Sharpe that he has been promoted to major on the order of the Prince Regent and assigns him the job of rescuing Lady Farthingdale (in reality Sharpe's old flame Josefina) from a deserters' enclave at Adrados. At the climax of the novel, it is Nairn who leads the British force that comes to Sharpe's aid when he is facing a French attack at Adrados.
Nairn has something of a friendship with Sharpe and meets with him again in "Sharpe's Regiment" to inform him that a request for reinforcements has been refused and the South Essex Regiment is in danger of being disbanded. He therefore gives Sharpe permission to take a party of four back to England to try and find reinforcements. He later greets Sharpe on his return to Spain and observes his harsh treatment of the corrupt Lieutenant-Colonel Girdwood. He gives his tacit approval of the behaviour but also warns Sharpe that he will arrange for Girdwood's replacement to be a hard taskmaster.
By the time of "Sharpe's Revenge", Nairn has finally been given command of a brigade after years as a staff officer. He has Sharpe assigned to him as his staff major and also makes Harper, Frederickson and Frederickson's company part of his command. He is finally given a chance to lead his men into battle at Toulouse, where he is injured by a canister shot. He claims he has only been hit in the leg and instructs Sharpe to lead the brigade forward. When Sharpe returns to the scene where Nairn fell after the battle, he learns that he died from his wounds - the canister had also pierced his lung.
Television.
Nairn appears in all three episodes of "Sharpe"'s second series, comprising "Sharpe's Enemy" and adaptations of "Sharpe's Company" and "Sharpe's Honour". His character is recreated as a Major (rather than a major general), who effectively fulfills the same duties as Hogan in the novels - the chief of Wellington's espionage operations.
Nairn is first seen in "Sharpe's Company", where he approaches Sharpe in the aftermath of the attack on Ciudad Rodrigo to discuss the wounding of Sharpe's commanding officer Colonel Lawford during the attack. Like Hogan, this Nairn is a major in the Royal Engineers and Sharpe criticises their performance during the attack. He is also a spymaster, as Sharpe learns when Nairn sends Teresa into Badajoz. Like many of the spymasters in the series, Nairn has a somewhat uneasy relationship with Sharpe, who sees him as placing Teresa in needless danger. He is at Wellington's side during the subsequent attack on Badajoz.
In "Sharpe's Enemy", Nairn's role is slightly expanded from in the novel. He realises the French have an interest in Adrados when he learns of the presence of Pierre Ducos, his opposite number. Along with Teresa, he spies on the French positions and, after Teresa is shot by Hakeswill, he takes her dying body to Sharpe. He is present in the courtyard when Ducos attempts to force Sharpe to surrender.
In his last episode, "Sharpe's Honour", Nairn worries about Sharpe's malaise in the aftermath of Teresa's death. It is Nairn who breaks up Sharpe's illegal duel with La Marques de Cesares el Grande ye Melida Sadaba and who arranges to have Sharpe's execution faked after he is accused of killing La Marques. He then despatches Sharpe and Harper to search for La Marques' widow, Helene and later gives permission for Harper to take the rest of the Chosen Men to rescue Sharpe after he is captured by Ducos. He is last seen, alongside Wellington as ever, watching the victory celebrations after the Battle of Vitoria. As with Hogan, his absence from subsequent series is not explained.
Harry Price.
Harry Price is a fictional character in the Richard Sharpe stories written by Bernard Cornwell. Characters named Harry Price appeared in two episodes of the "Sharpe" television series, played by different actors.
In the novels.
Price makes his first appearance in the novel "Sharpe's Company" (although he has a small role in "Sharpe's Battle", a novel written after but set before "Sharpe's Company"). He is a new lieutenant in the South Essex Regiment, serving as Sharpe's second-in-command in the light company, replacing Robert Knowles from the earlier books. He is fond of alcohol but affable and well liked by the men.
Price has minor roles in the next few novels. In "Sharpe's Sword", he is briefly placed in command of the light company after Sharpe is believed killed during the capture of Salamanca. He is involved in the action on the Portuguese/Spanish border in "Sharpe's Enemy" and is present at the Battle of Vitoria in "Sharpe's Honour.
He is given a larger role in the next novel, "Sharpe's Regiment", where he accompanies Sharpe, Harper and D'Alembord back to England to try and find recruits to bolster the depleted regiment. He plays a part in helping Sharpe take control of the battalion's training camp and expose a plan by corrupt officers to sell the recruits to other regiments. He then returns to Spain with the regiment, now known as the Prince of Wales' Own Volunteers and is promoted to captain and given command of a company after Captain Thomas is killed at the Battle of Nivelle.
In his last appearance, in "Sharpe's Waterloo", he is still with the regiment and, after they suffer casualties at Quatre Bras and Waterloo, the most senior officer after Colonel Ford to escape uninjured.When Sharpe takes command of the battalion, he promotes Price to major.
In the TV series.
Price appears in the TV adaptation "Sharpe's Company", played by Scott Cleverdon. He is given a similar role to that in the book but he is shot and apparently killed by Sergeant Hakeswill during the storming of Badajoz while trying to protect Teresa, a fate that befell Captain Knowles in the book.
However, a character named Harry Price appears in "Sharpe's Waterloo", played by Nicholas Irons. He talks to Sharpe and Harper and it is clear they know him quite well and that he is a veteran, possibly indicating that this is meant to be the same Harry Price from Sharpe's Company. When several soldiers are killed as a result of the Prince of Orange's incompetent orders at Quatre Bras, Price worries that his brother, who has just joined up, is among the dead. He is last seen in the closing seconds of the episode, standing alongside Sharpe as he turns back the French advance at Waterloo.
Lord John Rossendale.
Lord John Rossendale (17? – 18 June 1815) is a minor antagonist in the Richard Sharpe novels by Bernard Cornwell.
Rossendale first crosses Richard Sharpe's path in 1813 in "Sharpe's Regiment" as a courtier to the Prince Regent in London. Rossendale is initially an ally in Major Sharpe's attempts to find missing recruits to the South Essex Regiment, providing support and guidance through the social pitfalls of Court circles.
However, a year later, in "Sharpe's Revenge", Rossendale takes advantage of Sharpe's arrest for theft to embark on an affair with his wife, Jane, while also laying waste to Sharpe's considerable fortune.
In June 1815, at the outset of Napoleon's Hundred Days campaign, Rossendale satisfies his desire to see active service by joining the heavy cavalry appropriately enough under Henry Paget, Lord Uxbridge, who had conducted a similarly adulterous affair with the wife of Wellington's younger brother, Henry. He is accompanied by Jane, who is snubbed by society for her affair and who suspects she may be pregnant with Rossendale's bastard child ("Sharpe's Waterloo").
Unfortunately Sharpe, now a Lieutenant Colonel, is also serving with the Allied army, as staff officer to the Dutch Prince of Orange. Jane attempts to persuade Rossendale to murder Sharpe during the chaos of the imminent battle. When he suggests the French may kill Sharpe for them, she replies "They’ve had plenty of chances before and achieved nothing". Later that evening Sharpe and Rossendale clash at the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, where Sharpe humiliates his rival.
At the battle of Quatre Bras the next day, Sharpe corners Rossendale, destroys his pistol and sword and extracts a note of hand for the stolen money. Ashamed of his dishonourable conduct, Rossendale determines to prove himself during the forthcoming battle at Waterloo.
On the afternoon of the battle, the British Heavy Brigade, Rossendale in its midst, charges to complete the rout of a French infantry attack by the Comte d'Erlon at La Haye Sainte. Rossendale fights well, but the charge ends in disaster when the enthusiasm of the British cavalrymen leads them to gallop unsupported towards the French guns. Caught by French light cavalry, the British take appalling casualties. 
Rossendale is pursued by a group of French lancers and hussars, blinded, stabbed and left for dead. He lies helpless on the field until his throat is cut by a Belgian peasant woman looting the wounded in the aftermath of the Allied victory. His death renders the note of hand given to Sharpe worthless, as he dies bankrupt and his estate has no legal call on the money stolen by Jane.
In the Carlton UK TV adaptation, Rossendale was portrayed by Alexander Armstrong in "Sharpe's Regiment" and by Alexis Denisof in "Sharpe's Revenge", "Sharpe's Justice" and "Sharpe's Waterloo"
Sir Henry Simmerson.
Major General Sir Henry Simmerson is a fictional British officer in the Sharpe novels and TV series by Bernard Cornwell. 
He is a recurring villain, portrayed as a stereotypical snobbish, petty and tyrannical minor English aristocrat. He is narrow-minded, militarily inept and cowardly; while he is not presented as a clever man, he does display a certain cunning and deviousness.
In his first appearance in the novels, he is described as short, squat, and red-faced giving the impression of "a pig sitting on horseback."
Fictional biography.
Simmerson first appears in "Sharpe's Eagle", as commanding officer of the South Essex Regiment of the British Army, during the Talavera Campaign. Major Michael Hogan briefly sketches Simmerson's background as a Justice of the Peace, Member of Parliament for Paglesham, (a rotten borough), and a colonel in the Militia. He is also a distant cousin of General Sir Banastre Tarleton and thus has some influence at Horse Guards which serves to protect him, to a considerable extent, from the full consequences of his cowardice and mistakes on the battlefield. His considerable (inherited) wealth has allowed him to not only purchase his commission in the Army, but also raise the Regiment at his own expense. 
Simmerson is thus portrayed as the archetype of the military dilettante allowed to hold rank and responsibility in the British Army, a type which is the constant bane of professional soldiers like Sharpe. Throughout the first novel, he consistently ignores the advice of the few professional soldiers among his officers, and blames the often disastrous consequences of his own blunders on them. He also displays blatant nepotism in favouring his nephew, Christian Gibbons, as his aide.
The South Essex is assigned the relatively easy mission of linking up with an allied Spanish regiment and escorting Hogan to a point on the River Tagus to destroy a bridge that the French could use. In a minor skirmish with a French cavalry patrol, however, Simmerson's appalling judgement leads to the loss of a substantial number of men, and the loss of one of his regiment's two colours (presented by the king and representing the regiment's honour).
At the end of the novel, when the South Essex is positioned on the British flank during the Battle of Talavera, Simmerson panics and starts to withdraw the regiment, before he is ignominiously relieved from his post by William Lawford.
He is mentioned in passing in the subsequent novels as having returned to England and resumed his political activities, in particular helping to implement the new income tax.
In 1813, ("Sharpe's Regiment") Simmerson uses the second battalion of the South Essex in an illegal crimping operation, recruiting men for the South Essex then selling them to posts overseas. Sharpe exposes him and presumably this is the end of his military career (Simmerson was (legally) crimping long before this and the historical notes to "Sharpe's Regiment" reveal this is how he obtained his commission). Sharpe also snubs Simmerson by eloping with his niece, Jane Gibbons.
Television portrayal.
In the first run of the television adaptations, Simmerson, played by Michael Cochrane, appears in "Sharpe's Eagle" (1993), "Sharpe's Sword" (1995) and "Sharpe's Regiment" (1996). His appearances in "Eagle" and "Regiment" remain faithful to the novel versions, while his appearance in "Sword" is a creation of the show's writers, since that story was largely re-vamped from the novel. 
Simmerson proved to be a popular character with the viewers, and was brought back for several subsequent appearances.
In "Sword" he has renounced his military rank in favour of being a political commissar with the British Army in Spain (and reports that a court of inquiry found him innocent of losing the colour in "Eagle"). Simmerson takes a licentious interest in "Lass" (Emily Mortimer), a novice nun under Sharpe's protection, rendered mute by the trauma of watching her sisters tortured for information by a French spy. Simmerson tries, on two occasions, to rape Lass, but fails both times, due both to Lass's pluck, and the intervention of an Irish priest, who thrashes Simmerson in a sword fight. It is also implied that Simmerson betrayed a night attack attempted by the South Essex to the French, in the hopes that Sharpe would be killed.
In the revival series, Cochrane returns as Simmerson, now an officer in the army attached to the British East India Company, in the 2006 revival, "Sharpe's Challenge" and its 2008 sequel "Sharpe's Peril".
In "Peril", Simmerson is found naked, staked to the ground and is saved by Sharpe, and whether it is the severe sunstroke he has suffered or an offer of genuine friendship, becomes Sharpe's ally by bidding him a fond farewell at the end.
Jorge Vincente.
Captain Jorge Vincente is a fictional character who features in the Richard Sharpe novels by Bernard Cornwell.
Jorge Vincente first encounters Richard Sharpe in the aftermath of the first Battle of Oporto in March 1809, when both men are cut off from their respective armies - Sharpe and his riflemen from the British, Lieutenant Vincente with a handful of men from the Portuguese 18th (2nd Oporto) Line Infantry.
Vincente is a studious and idealistic young man, who prior to the French invasion of Portugal studied law at University of Coimbra. His passionate adherence to the rules of war bring him into frequent conflict with Sharpe, but the two men discover a mutual respect as they work and fight together in the weeks leading up to the second Battle of Oporto ("Sharpe's Havoc").
This is fully vindicated the following year, when both men fight at the Battle of Bussaco, and are again cut off together behind enemy lines in Coimbra. Vincente, now Captain of a Portuguese caçadores regiment, modelled after the Sharpe's own 95th Rifles has matured into an able soldier, without losing his innate optimism. 
Vincente's admiration of Sharpe is expressed in his adoption of many of Sharpe's idiosyncrasies, including his possession of a 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword and a Baker rifle ("Sharpe's Escape").
Between the events of "Sharpe's Havoc" and "Sharpe's Escape", Vincente marries Kate Savage, the daughter and heiress of an English port wine producer.
Jorge Vincente does not feature in any of the TV adaptations.

Young the Giant (album)

Young the Giant is the eponymous debut album by American indie rock band Young the Giant. It was released digitally by the Roadrunner record label on October 26, 2010, and was followed by a physical CD and vinyl release in the United States on January 25, 2011. The album was released in the United Kingdom on May 2, 2011.
The band began work on the album with producer Joe Chiccarelli, engineers Lars Fox and Ian Kirkpatrick, and mixer Michael H. Brauer in early 2010. Young the Giant lead singer Sameer Gadhia described the album as having a "summery, kind of an Orange County sound." Songs on the album include the U.S. single "My Body", which reached the top five of "Billboard"'s Alternative Songs chart; "Apartment", the first international single; and "Cough Syrup", which was originally recorded for the 2008 EP "Shake My Hand" when the band was known as The Jakes.
Background.
Following the departure of keyboardist Ehson Hashemian in late 2009, rock group The Jakes changed its name to Young the Giant. 
Lead singer Sameer Gadhia said the new band name did not have any specific meaning, but that it epitomized the band they had become. "I was thinking about what we want to portray," Gadhia said. "We are still youthful, but when we aren't, we still want to have that exuberance in our music."
In early 2010, Young the Giant began work on its debut album with Grammy-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli. The album features live track recording, which the band had never previously attempted. Drummer Francois Comtois noted that working with Chiccarelli for the sessions "was incredibly intimidating, but he kicked our asses into shape." Gadhia also recalled the experience: "We were criticized in ways we had never even thought of, and were constantly pushed to reach the next level. Looking back on it, [...] he shaped us into better musicians, performers, and songwriters. It was also great fun hearing his stories about Bono, Jay-Z and Elton John.
Composition.
An underlying theme of the album, according to Gadhia, is the "feeling of isolation and almost surreal happiness with a lover." Much of the album was inspired by the beach, Gadhia said. "It is summery, kind of an Orange County sound. When we first started doing this seriously and living together, Newport was just like eternal summer for us. We did draw from a lot of that." 
In particular, the track "Strings" is an attempt to showcase the sounds of the beach. Gadhia described that the band wanted to "have the arrangements cascade together and, tonally, we all worked hard with Joe to recreate the fervor and wetness of splashing waves."
Gadhia said the track "My Body" is an embodiment of the band: "a combination of youthful energy and slightly naive but optimistic determination. It captures a sense of passion, urgency and excitement that we've felt throughout the writing and recording process over the past two years." 
Another song, "Cough Syrup", was co-written by former bandmate Ehson Hashemian and dates back to the 2008 EP "Shake My Hand", when the band was still known as The Jakes.

Reception.
"Young the Giant" has received mixed reviews from critics. Jody McCutcheon of ChartAttack described the album as having "12 songs rich in texture and progression, vocal hooks and catchy guitar riffs," and said the band "suffuse their sound with a thick, juicy ecstasy." Caitlin Meyer commends the album for "boasting consistent catchiness while also incorporating a delectable combination of continuity, depth, and progression." Meyer added it is "the kind of record that grabs you at first listen and becomes more meaningful every time through." David Menconi of "Spin" compliments the manner in which "Sameer Gadhia sings in a declara-tive key of unwavering determination, undergirded by Jacob Tilley's sophisticated guitar sprawl and Francois Comtois' martial drums as the band's debut album goes marching on and on and on." Amazon.com ranked "Young the Giant" as the third best rock album of 2010.
Chris Conaton of PopMatters called the album unoriginal, and that the band knows "how to replicate the strong moments in rock history. But they have yet to really figure out their own stylistic stamp." Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen called the album "devoid of personality," explaining that "politely distorted guitars twist and churn but never turn into riffs. Choruses become placeholders instead of hooks." Cohen also criticized the lyrics for being "neither plainspoken enough to reveal simple truths nor evocative enough to scan as poetry."
British artist Morrissey, known for outspoken skepticism towards modern music, praised the album on the fansite True to You.

Make Me a Tory

Make Me a Tory is a 2007 British authored documentary film directed by Daniel Cormack for Channel 4.
Synopsis.
The film opens with Daniel Cormack returning to the area of South London in which he grew up and reflecting on how the influence of that predominantly left-wing environment formed his political views. In spite of being born in 1979 as one of "Thatcher's children", the "thought of nailing his colours to the Tory mast" seems "nothing short of horrific". Nonetheless, since casting his first vote at the age of 18 in the Labour landslide of 1997 he has become increasingly disillusioned with the Labour government and wonders if he can "do the unthinkable and turn Tory".
Setting off on a journey around the country to meet Conservatives, he starts by revisiting his alma mater, Oxford University where he "first met people who were actually Conservatives". He is invited to a Port and Policy debate ("the Oxford equivalent of setting the world to rights over a few beers") held by the Oxford University Conservative Association, but despite a lively and at times provocative debate about David Cameron's leadership - as well as large amounts of Port - he finds himself just as unconvinced by the Oxford Conservatives as in his student days.
Traveling onwards, Daniel goes litter picking with the "gung-ho teenage Tories of the Wirral" and is impressed by their altruism, lack of cynicism and sense of civic responsibility even if the group's leader has nicknamed her car Maggie. Back in South London, Daniel is invited to a dinner party hosted by the chair of the local Conservative Future branch, Claire Hilley. Over dinner, a heated argument breaks out over the legacy of Thatcher between the ardent believers in her policies and those more in tune with David Cameron's compassionate Conservatism, leaving Daniel to ponder whether this schism in the party will manifest itself in a Conservative government. 
The next day Daniel goes leafleting with the national Chair of Conservative Future - and subsequent 'Tatler Tory' election candidate for Tooting, South London - Mark Clarke. Coming from a similarly deprived background, Daniel hopes Mark's rationale for being a Conservative will help him make up his mind; a hope which is somewhat dashed when Mark makes an off-the-cuff disparaging remark about the "local people" on the council estate they are canvassing. Realising how much his background has formed his political views - and remembering the hostility shown to a Tory election candidate who came to speak at his school in 1997 - Daniel suggests Mark does a talk about Conservatism as the comprehensive he attended, Thomas Tallis School. Mark faces some robust questioning from the students, but to Daniel's surprise some of them say they would consider voting Conservative in the general election.
Confused, not only by the different varieties of conservative beliefs, but also by his own mixed feelings over going against the grain of his upbringing, Daniel decides the best way to decide once and for all is to speak to David Cameron. Explaining that Thatcher was a 'hate figure' where he grew up, Daniel asks Cameron how the Conservatives have gone from denying the concept of society to embracing it and whether this is a genuine change or a cosmetic one. Cameron replies by saying that "the 1980s was all about solving the problem of Britain's broken economy now it is actually a message much more about...the broken society. Leaving Portcullis House, Daniel concludes that while it would be a "big leap of faith" to ask the Conservatives to pick up the broken pieces of society, the Conservatives he's met have at least removed some of his negative preconceptions about the Tories.
Reception.
Although originally scheduled in an off-peak slot in a series of works by new directors on Channel 4, the programme went on to achieve wider awareness when, in 2008, the British Film Institute screened the film theatrically as part of a "Director's Showcase" in their February 2008 programme. Later that year, growing recognition of the film led its director and author to win a "Hot Shot" award by the trade paper "Broadcast" in their annual round-up of the best up and coming talent under 30.
In 2010, "Make Me a Tory" was selected for preservation by the British Film Institute's National Archive as well as being programmed as a permanent exhibit in the BFI's Médiathèques in London, Cambridge, Derby, Wrexham and Newcastle as part of the "Ballot Box" collection of notable films on politics. It was also selected for the National Media Museum's permanent "TV Heaven" exhibition and clips of the programme were used in Channel 4's "Alternative Election Night 2010" coverage.
Critical reviews and reactions.
Time Out London reviewed the BFI's theatrical screening:
"Director Daniel Cormack is a likeable presence as he goes front of camera in this political documentary. A disillusioned Labour supporter, Cormack goes in search of the Tory youth of today to see if his vote can be swayed. From the big teeth ya-ya brigade of Oxford Uni conservative club to interviewing the big, blue man himself - David Cameron - Cormack ends up unfortunately still floating, but it is a worthwhile and interesting piece about the future Conservatism."

Demid Ilyich Kulikalov

Demid Ilyich Kulikalov was an administrator of Russian America during the first decade of the 19th century. He served in the Russian-American Company for several decades, led early expeditions into what is now Alaska, administered RAC interests in the Pribilof Islands, and headed the Russian-American Company's Atka station. 
Kulikalov's origins with the Russian-American Company are unclear. In 1794, he was the co-leader of the first Russian expedition from Kodiak Island to explore Yakutat Bay, a hunting expedition that covered much of the southern coast of Alaska and included more than 1,000 natives and Russians.
In 1805, Kulikalov ordered to head the RAC's organization in the Andreanof Islands. Before he departed the RAC's base of operations in Unalaska, however, he was flogged on the orders of Nikolai Rezanov for alleged cruelty to an Aleut woman and her child and was expelled from Russian America in chains. Kuliakalov was a trusted assistant to Russian America governor Alexander Baranov, and either returned to the colony or was never transported out (sources are unclear). Kuliakalov was put in charge of establishing a colony on St. Matthew Island in 1809 and returned to Unalaska in 1810. That year, Kulikalov unsuccessfully sought to have an illegitimate child (born through a partnership with an Aleut woman) sent to Russia for education. The reason given was that Kulikalov "had legitimate children in Irkutsk." Ten years later, Baranov's intervention secured son a trip to St. Petersburg, and he later returned to Russian America.

Constance E. Padwick

Constance Evelyn Padwick (July 2, 1886 – 1968) known as Paddie by her friends was born at the Manor House, West Thorney, Sussex, England and grew up near Chichester, in the English countryside as well as in London. She was educated at home and then further trained as a teacher. She was known as one of the leading British women missionaries and one of the first women missiologists in the twentieth century who also worked with Church Mission Society for several years. She lived and worked in Cairo, Egypt and traveled to many different places from Fez to Lahore. In 1947 when conditions were bad because of the war she was asked to leave Jerusalem and went to Kordofan in Sudan. Padwick prepared textbooks for Christian schools for three years and then moved to Istanbul and then returned to England in 1957. She spent almost forty years in the Middle East where she developed her knowledge of Arabic and her knowledge of Mosques and devotees helped her write her best known published book which is the "Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in Common Use."
Family.
Padwick's father was a non-practising Barrister who farmed his own land. At the age of ten Padwick went to Finsbury Square, London where she was taught by her godmother and was also with other children through most of her teen years. This godmother was also the aunt, and governess to many other children of this household. The father of the children of this particular household was James Pratt, who was the grandson of Josiah Pratt, a founder in 1799 of C.M.S. After her teen years in this household in London she went with one of her cousins to Palestine in 1910 for a visit and fell in love with the Middle East. Near the end of her life she then lived with her sister Joy in Lower Odcombe, in Somerset, where she died.
Education.
Padwick was educated from home and then went out to be trained as a teacher. After her teen years she went briefly to Paris and then back with her family in Sussex where she started studying the New Testament Greek and became active in the Student Christian Movement. She went to the University of London and studied Arabic, Arab folklore and the understanding of Islam, she also took her teachers training Certificate with distinction and was rewarded by a scholarship to the School of Oriental and African Studies within the University of London. Padwick also studied Greek and pedagogy and was a student of Oriental studies of the American University in Cairo. She worked from 1909 to 1916 on the home staff of the Church Mission Society as the editor of children's magazines.
Educational work.
In 1912 Padwick joined C.M.S and was the editor of children's magazines. Padwick was drawn to the Middle East through the reading of the biography of Douglas M. Thornton written by Temple Gairdner. She believed literature was a great evangelistic tool. “After looking very carefully at the different positions from which it would now be possible to serve the Moslem world by means of Christian literature, and after much prayer, I have come to the deliberate conclusion that it is as a C.M.S literature missionary, if C.M.S. will have me, that I want the privilege of serving. For both on a general view and on a detailed examination, it seems to me that God calls us now to strengthen the Cairo literature department of C.M.S (CMS 3)” But when she offered to work overseas with C.M.S., she was rejected because of ill health.
Padwick nevertheless worked in Cairo with the Nile Mission Press until 1921 and then went back to the University of London where she wrote a thesis on Arab Folklore. In 1923 she went back to Cairo, Egypt under C.M.S. and became the editorial secretary for the Central Committee for Christian Literature for Muslims. She also served in Cairo under C.M.S. till the end of her career for over three decades which included her time in Palestine in 1937. After the war in 1947 she was asked to leave Palestine and go to the Nuba Mountains in Sudan where she wrote Arab text books for schools. She then spent three years at Katcha Kordofan which ended in November 1951 with serious illness at the age of sixty-five. Padwick wrote many different Arabic materials for those people and she ended her time in Sudan in 1951 when she became ill and retired in 1952 from C.M.S. but never really truly retired till 1957 in Dorset, Village Maiden Newton close to the heart of the Hardy country of Wessex. Somewhere in between this time she was first nursed at Omduran hospital and then by friends in Kenya until she was ready to travel to Istanbul where she spent four quiet years.
Writings.
Constance E. Padwick is most well known for her writing. While working for Church Mission Society she was an editor of children’s magazines, she was also one the editors of the "Orient and Occident" which is a Christian monthly published in Cairo. She is also known for writing biographies of Henry Martyn, Lilias Trotter and her colleague William Henry Temple Gairdner. She also wrote "Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in common use," as well as "Mackay of the great lake," "The Master of the Impossible: Sayings for the Most part in Parable from the Letters and Journals of Lilias Trotter of Algiers" (1938), and many more. She loved Muslims and writing about them, she developed specific materials for Muslim readers which included biographies about different missionaries who worked among Muslims. Many of her writings have helped youth deal with the stress of modern living and she saw her writings as a form of service in which she conducted with high standards, dedicated research and true objectivity. “Padwick's long career as missionary and missiologist bridges the gap between the female writers and strategists of the women's missionary movement and the contemporary female missiologists and mission strategists.” "All that she wrote, she wrote out of a profound and missionary commitment to Christ as Christianity receives Him." 
It was hard for women during Padwick’s time to be missionaries or to receive the respect that women deserved. Padwick wrote in and during a male-missionary-dominated era but she managed to make the transition, and was one of the first women to accomplish this. Her writings were published over a fifty year period from 1918 to 1967 and her last one was published when she was 81.
Her most well known book "“Muslim Devotions: A Study of Prayer-Manuals in common use”" analyzes the religious thought of Islam. According to Kenneth Cragg, her biography of Temple Gairdner was “one of the classics of missionary biography of this century."
Hobbies.
Padwick had a lifelong joy of external nature and loved flowers. She was accepted as a member by the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain. She also loved going to different little bookstores and searching for little hand held prayer books and pocket manuals to include in her work on Muslim Devotions. She desired to know Islam's inward spirituality and wanted this devotional book to speak to the heart of Muslims. This consumed her for more than twenty years. She gained respect through friends and learned from everyone and this book is now a valuable compendium of Muslim spirituality. "Muslim Devotions, it may be truly said, is a worthy expression of Christian initiative and at the same time a comprehensive index to Muslim liturgy: It is a gesture of imagination inspired by one faith towards the inner genius of another." "She attained a patient kinship with Muslim norms and themes and made their world her own." She also stated, "for it is in knowing that we are known."

<doc id="31054937" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31054937" title="Canceled NFL games">
Canceled NFL games

The following is a list of regular season games that have been canceled by the National Football League since 1933. While canceling games was extremely common prior to this date, since that year, the NFL has only seen four instances in which games have been canceled and not been rescheduled. In the first case (1974) and, to date, the most recent (2011), only one preseason game was canceled, while seven weeks of regular season games were lost in 1982 and one week of regular season games was lost in 1987. In all four seasons, the cancellations were the results of labor disputes between the league and the National Football League Players Association.
In addition to this game, one other game (albeit an exhibition) was canceled for reasons other than a labor dispute: the China Bowl, which was originally scheduled to take place in 2007, was postponed to 2009 and eventually canceled due to an economic recession.
1920s and 1930s.
Canceling games was far more common in the 1920s and early 1930s, in the founding years of the league. When a team did not want to play a game, they could cancel without any punishment or penalty. When league schedules were standardized in 1933, cancellations were effectively banned, and teams would have to forfeit the game or postpone if a cancellation was due to issues outside the team's control. There have been no forfeits in the league's history; a 1921 game between the Rochester Jeffersons and the Washington Senators is occasionally listed as a forfeit, but because of the lax cancellation rules of the time, is listed in modern records as a cancellation. The November 17, 1935 Boston Redskins at Philadelphia Eagles game was canceled due to rain and snow.
1974 Players Strike.
The 1974 College All-Star Game, an exhibition game that pitted the most recent Super Bowl champion (Miami Dolphins) against a team composed entirely of rookies, was canceled as a result of a players' strike. The strike was resolved before any further games were canceled; the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, along with the rest of the 1974 NFL season, went on as scheduled, although at least one game was held with the Denver Broncos using a squad of rookie replacement players.
1982 Players Strike.
In 1982, players began a 57-day strike following the completion of the second week of the regular season. As a result of the impasse, games were simply canceled until a settlement was reached. Upon reaching that settlement, the NFL announced that the games originally scheduled for the third week of the season would be played following the completion of the resumed regular season, which saw weeks 11–16 played as scheduled. This meant the 1982 shortened season would include only nine regular season contests played by each club. This was followed by an expansion of the playoffs from 10 to 16 teams.
In order to ensure as many teams had played their division opponents, the ninth week was designed to ensure as many teams had played their division opponents during the season. All but two contests (New York Jets-Kansas City and Dallas-Minnesota) matching opponents from the same division.
Games postponed for rescheduled Week Nine.
As a result of the NFL attempting to ensure each team had played their division rivals (not used for the season) once to ensure maximum attendance, the NFL used most such division rivalries to be assigned as Week Nine games. The Giants-Philadelphia Monday Night game originally scheduled for Week Seven was moved to Sunday, while the Dallas-Minnesota game originally scheduled for Week Three on Sunday was moved to Monday.
1987 Players Strike.
In 1987, the players went on strike for a second time in-season, again following the second week of the campaign. However, unlike 1982, the owners took the bold step of using replacement players. After missing just one week of action, the NFL resumed with replacement players for Week 4. By the time Week 6 had rolled around, enough players had crossed the picket lines and forced an agreement. The canceled games of Week 3 simply weren't made up, and the league counted the three weeks of game results featuring the replacement players as regular season games toward each team's final standings. By Week 7, the teams had all players back in action, with all teams completing a 15-game schedule. Also unlike 1982, there was no change to the playoff format that season.
September 11, 2001 attacks.
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the NFL postponed the games for Week 2 of the 2001 season (originally scheduled for September 16 – 17) until the end of the regular season. All playoff games following the 2001 regular season, including Super Bowl XXXVI, and the 2002 Pro Bowl were re-scheduled one week later.
This was in contrast during the wake of the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963 when the NFL went ahead and played its full slate of games that week, a decision that then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle would later regret, though he also stated that Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's secretary had urged him to allow the games to be played. Meanwhile, the American Football League canceled week 12 of its 1963 season and later rescheduled those games.
2011 owners lockout.
On July 22, 2011, the NFL announced that that year's Pro Football Hall of Fame Game (originally set for August 7 of that year between Chicago and St. Louis) had been canceled, due to an ongoing lockout that had been in place since March of that year. The league approved a new collective bargaining agreement on July 21, but at the same time announced the cancellation of the game, citing the fact that the players would not have enough time in training camp to prepare before the game.
The NFL also had contingency plans to cancel and/or postpone regular season games (up to eight) if a labor agreement could not be reached by the start of the regular season. The league did not have to implement the plans, since the players association agreed to terms with the NFL on July 25, ending the lockout.
Effects due to severe weather and natural disasters.
Games have been postponed in the modern era of the league in which severe weather or natural disasters hampered the ability for a team to host a home game. But in all of those cases, those games either saw a switch in the location of the games or the moving of the game to a different date in the schedule.
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew forced the September 6 game between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins at Joe Robbie Stadium to be rescheduled to October 18, when both teams originally had a bye week.
The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damaged Candlestick Park, forcing the San Francisco 49ers to play their next home game against New England Patriots at Stanford University's Stanford Stadium. In the wake of the October 25, 2003 Cedar Fire, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist in the disaster relief process. Because of the soot and particulate matter in the air from the fire two days earlier, the NFL was forced to move the Monday Night Football game on October 27 between the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged the Louisiana Superdome. The NFL decided that the New Orleans Saints' first regularly scheduled home game against the New York Giants be played in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, with the Saints the home team in name only. For the rest of the season, the Saints home games were split between the Alamodome in San Antonio and Louisiana State University's Tiger Stadium.
On December 26, 2010, a "Sunday Night Football" game between the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia was postponed to Tuesday, December 28, due to a severe snowstorm. It was the first Tuesday NFL game in 64 years.
Effects of shared stadiums and sports complexes.
There have also been rare occasions in which games had to be pushed back one night because of a last-minute scheduling conflict in the facility of those games, most notably when an NFL team has shared a home stadium with a team from Major League Baseball and the baseball team has needed the building for a post-season game. This was a frequent occurrence when there were several shared stadiums across the country, but since 2012 only one such venue remains: O.co Coliseum in Oakland, home of the NFL Raiders and the MLB Athletics; both teams are in the process of exploring a new stadium.
Sunday World Series games in 1986, 1987 and 1997 have forced a football team to play their originally home game on the following night. In at least one case, a potential Oakland Athletics baseball playoff game in 2001 forced the Raiders to play their contest against the Dallas Cowboys two weeks in advance to avoid a possible conflict, when both clubs originally had their bye week (as it turned out, the Athletics ended up getting eliminated a few days before the originally scheduled date of the Cowboys-Raiders game). In at least another case, a 2013 baseball playoff game forced the Raiders to postpone their originally scheduled Sunday afternoon game against the San Diego Chargers from 4:25 pm Eastern/1:25 pm Pacific to a far late-night start time of 11:35 Eastern/8:35 Pacific.
There are several cities, however, in which an NFL stadium is adjacent to an MLB park, and share the same parking lots and other ancillary facilities. In at least one case of such a relatively last-minute scheduling conflict, a New York Giants–Philadelphia Eagles game at Lincoln Financial Field was moved from 4:15 pm to 1:00 pm to accommodate the Philadelphia Phillies hosting Game 4 of the 2009 World Series at adjacent Citizens Bank Park.

Botanical Garden of Santa Catalina

The Botanical Garden of Santa Catalina or in basque: “Santa Katalina Lorategi Botanikoa”, is a botanical garden about 32,500 meters square extension, in the municipality of Iruña de Oca, in the surroundings of Sierra de Badaya, province of Alava, autonomous community of the Basque Country, Spain. It’s a member of the Ibero Macaronesian association of Botanical Gardens.
Location.
The garden is located in the ruins of the Santa Catalina’s convent of Badaya between the Zadorra river and the mountain range of Badaia. It is exactly situated on Trespuentes village, in the municipality of Iruña de Oca.
History.
The origins of the botanical garden.
The Iruña family, probably the most powerful family of Iruña de Oca, were the ones that built the tower house in the thirteenth century, a century of feudal revolts time.
Century and a half later when there was peace in the area, the Iruña decided to change their place of residence and built a new building in Vitoria (now Doña Otxanda tower), and gave his former residence to the order of Hieronymites.
A few years later passed to the Augustinian monks, who built the monastery of Santa Catalina, and kept the old tower. In the old tower they attached a church which had its own cloister.
In 1835 with the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal, it was vacanted by the monks. And the total destruction took over the premise and in the First Carlist War was turned into barracks for the troops of the pretender Carlos María Isidro de Borbón. After the fall of this fortress, the Carlist put it on fire and left it in ruins.
Trespuentes Botanical Garden began in 1999 as a project, and in 2003 was already a reality.
The Iruña family.
The Iruña were a family of merchants who exported wool from Castile to the Netherlands. They went so far as to occupy important political positions in the city of Vitoria. Some members of the family were mayors of the city during the fifteenth century. They belonged to the political party "of the Ayala" and managed to get numerous properties in the city. The merchant Juan Martínez de Iruña, father of the also merchant Andrés Martinez de Iruña, in 1426 came to possess up to 26 houses distributed in different neighborhoods of Vitoria, an oven and 2 mills (according to the inventory of property). 
The Iruña conducted a marriage strategy to improve their economic interests and family relationships with prestigious vitorian families. For example, Maria Martinez de Iruña, daughter of Juan Martinez de Iruña got married to Angebín Sanchez de Maturana in 1408, one of the leading families in the city of Vitoria that belonged to the political party "of the Calleja”. This marriage increased the power of the Iruña in Vitoria and in the provinces of Alava and established ties between the families, who were members of different political parties.
The Monastery of Santa Catalina of Badaya.
Inside the Santa Catalina Botanical Garden of Badaya there are remnants of the old convent of Santa Catalina de Badaya and of the tower house of Andrés Martínez de Iruña. This family was originally from Trespuentes and finally moved to Vitoria so as to improve their economic interests.
Fernando, bishop of Calahorra in the years 1403-1408, built the convent of the order of the jerome monks of Santa Catalina of Badaya. The convent’s restored ruins are still visible in the botanical garden of Santa Catalina of Badaya, under the rule of St. Augustín. The monastery was built from an old abandoned hermitage. This foundation was endowed with the money of the merchant Andrés Martínez de Iruña, owner of lands and of a tower house. 
In 1413, Jerónimo de Quintana, prior of that monastery, sent a letter to the Pope Benedict XIII in order to request approval of its founding. The Pope approved and let the prior to built the new jerome monastery, giving several measures to consolidate this new monastic center. He gave different indulgences to those who contribute financially to the construction of the convent. Moreover, he allowed two friars of the convent to act as confessors in Santa María de Badaya with pilgrims who came near.
Finally, in the middle of the fifteenth century the income obtained by the friars was not enough to keep members of the small religious community and pay the expenses incurred in maintaining the infrastructure of the convent. 
That's why, the Jerome monks abandoned the convent and give the ownership of the monastery to another order of monks, the San Agustin order, in 1472.
Collections.
The topography of this area allows three types of climatic conditions and, therefore, of flora: Mediterranean, atlantic and mixed. Guards more than 1,200 botanical species from all five continents. There are three routes organized:
• Native Plants
• Plants Eastern and Australian trees.
• A variety of aquatic species.

Jundiz recycling plant

The Jundiz recycling plant is located in the Basque Country (autonomous community), particularly in Vitoria-Gasteiz Jundiz Álava. This place is responsible for recycling the city garbage. The trash is converted by a physical-chemical or mechanical process to submit a substance or a product already used to a cycle of total or partial treatment for a commodity or a new product or raw materials from waste, introducing them back into life cycle. This occurs at the prospect of depletion of natural resources, macro economic and eliminate waste efficiently.
First of Euskadi.
Jundiz recycling plant is the first of Basque Country (autonomous community). Zabalgarbi, the facility receives wastes from Bilbao, not recycled. It is similar to an incinerator being planned for disposing of municipal waste in San Sebastian and other municipalities in Gipuzkoa.
Compost, which so far received only Vitoria-Gasteiz waste, will begin to collect in the coming weeks the rest of Álava after proving its effectiveness.
The Diputation of Álava invests 1.4 million euros in expanding facilities and new systems that treat and 5,000 tons annually.
The expansion of the plant classification of packaging waste in Jundiz already terminated following a statutory investment of 1.4 million euros.
The Department of Environment, under provincial plans mugarri and Waste, proposed the modernization of this plant, which already has 9 years of life and dealing with all packaging waste in the Territory with a movement of 5,000 tons year.
With the aim of improving performance in the classification of packaging, the concession for operating, Jundiz joint venture formed by Yarrow and FCC, has undertaken the expansion of the plant with a new building for the reception of waste. This ship, of 1,000 square meters, in addition to the existing facility of 2,500 square meters, to avoid waste reception outdoors.
In addition to the expansion, the plant makes two important technical improvements. On the one hand, after a feasibility study, is launching a pilot mobile facility for the best use of the "fraction rejection." On the other hand, the plant incorporates a new bag opener which increases the capacity and performance at the beginning of the treatment process.
The installations.
The facilities are varied. To begin with a ship has reception waste. This ship, of 1000 square meters are attached to the existing 2500 square meters to avoid waste reception outdoors. It has a digester that converts organic waste into fertilizer and methane in the process that gives off the premises to generate electricity. Has also launched a pilot mobile facility for the better use of the fraction of rejection. This machine is intended advantage the %20 of the sewage reaching the plant from the yellow bins. The plant also incorporates a system of open bags to enhance the ability and performance in the treatment process. Finally, includes the construction of a wind turbine that provides the %10 of the electric power consumed by the plant.
Compost.
The compost, is the product obtained by composting, and constitutes an "average" of decomposition of organic matter, which itself is a good fertilizer. Humus is called the "higher" decomposition of organic matter. The compost humus is used as fertilizer, both organic. 
Organic matter decomposes via aerobic or Anaerobic digestion means. Call "composting" aerobic cycle (high presence of oxygen) decomposition of organic matter. Called "digestion" anaerobic cycle (with no or little presence of oxygen) decomposition of organic matter. 
The compost is naturally obtained by decomposing aerobic (with oxygen) of organic waste and plant debris, animal excrement and slurry, through the mass reproduction of thermophilic aerobic bacteria that are present naturally in any place (later the continue fermentation the other species of bacteria, fungus and Actinobacteria). Typically, this is to avoid (if possible) the putrefaction of organic waste (excess water, preventing aeration-oxygenation and creates smelly anaerobic biological conditions), although some industrial composting processes used by anaerobic bacteria of putrefaction. 
Compost produced in a garden.The compost used in agriculture and gardening as an amendment to the soil fertilizer, but also used in landscaping, erosion control, coatings and soil remediation. 
In addition to its direct use, composting involves a strategic and environmentally acceptable solution to the problem created by large urban centers (and their organic household solid waste) and agricultural, forestry and livestock, whose organic waste should be treated. Composting is an alternative technology to others that are not always respectful of natural resources and environment and also have a high cost. 
In Jundiz they use an inndustrial composting systems that are increasingly being installed as a waste management alternative to landfills, along with other advanced waste processing systems. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with anaerobic digestion or in-vessel composting, is called mechanical biological treatment, increasingly used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating biodegradable waste before it enters a landfill reduces global warming from fugitive methane; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing landfill gas that contains methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
Large-scale composting systems are used by many urban centers around the world. Co-composting is a technique which combines solid waste with de-watered biosolids, although difficulties controlling inert and plastic contamination from municipal solid waste makes this approach less attractive. 
Jundiz recycling plant genereted 5,000 tons of fertilizer last year.Compostplant,opened in November 2006 at the site of Júndiz, swallowed up 50,000 tonnes of waste deposited by the citizens in the gray container, which was incorporated last twelve months. The huge 'stomach' of the facility has become half of those remains at 5,000 tonnes, five million kilos,in organic fertilizer called compost.
Latest wins fertilizer were obtained a few days ago, as the system 'digestive' of Biocompost takes eight weeks to complete the decomposition of food waste in the compound of earthy appearance that the processor tries to sell to farmers. Ensure that there is no risks to crops. In short, each bag an average of ten kilos, 4.40 have become compost, 800 grams have been destined for recycling and the remaining 4.80 kilos, have been concentrated to reduce its volume and minimize the cost to transport to landfill.
Before the start of the "digestion", a complex chain of filters, hoppers and magnets separated from the contents of the bags in metals, plastics and cardboard for recycling and other recyclable materials and articles which by their size, they could not be recycled or decomposed . The first twelve months have brought in 4,000 tons -4 million kilos, which Biocompost sold to recyclers. The remains disposable, which is compressed into blocks to be taken to the landfill, totaling 24,000 tons, almost half of what swallowed by the installation. Industrial systems

Biodigestor.
There are a number of anaerobic organism that are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion including acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetogens) and methane-forming (methanogens). These organisms feed upon the initial feedstock, which undergoes a number of different processes converting it to intermediate molecules including sugars, hydrogen, and acetic acid, before finally being converted to biogas.
Different species of bacteria are able to survive at different temperature ranges. Ones living optimally at temperatures between 35–40 °C are called mesophiles or mesophilic bacteria. Some of the bacteria can survive at the hotter and more hostile conditions of 55–60 °C, these are called thermophile.Methanogens come from the domain of archaea. This family includes species that can grow in the hostile conditions of hydrothermal vents. These species are more resistant to heat and can therefore operate at high temperatures, a property that is unique to thermophile.
As with aerobic systems the bacteria in anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive. In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen. Gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks. Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air. The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, then the 'intermediate' end products are primarily alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide with trace levels of hydrogen sulfide.In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.
Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. It is therefore common practice to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as "seeding" the digesters, and typically takes place with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry.
The key process stages of anaerobic digestion
There are four key biological and chemical stages of anaerobic digestion:
1. Hydrolysis
2. Acidogenesis
3. Acetogenesis
4. Methanogenesis
In most cases biomass is made up of large organic polymers. In order for the bacteria in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material, these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts. These constituent parts or monomers such as sugars are readily available by other bacteria. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis. Therefore hydrolysis of these high molecular weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion. Through hydrolysis the complex organic molecules are broken down into simple sugars, acids and fatty acids.
Acetate and Hydrogen are produced in the first stages can be used directly by methanogens. Molecules such as volatile fatty acids with a chain length that is greater than acetate must first be catabolised into compounds that can be directly utilised by methanogens.
The biological process of acidogenesis is where there is further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic (fermentative) bacteria. Here VFAs are created along with ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide as well as other by-products. The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way that milk sours.
The third stage anaerobic digestion is acetogenesis. Here simple molecules created through the acidogenesis phase are further digested by an acetogens to produce largely acetic acid as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
The terminal stage of anaerobic digestion is the biological process of methanogenesis. Here methanogens utilise the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane, carbon dioxide and water. It is these components that makes up the majority of the biogas emitted from the system.Methanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 8. The remaining, non-digestible material which the microbes cannot feed upon, along with any dead bacterial remains constitutes the digestate.
A simplified generic chemical equation for the overall processes outlined above is as follows:
C6H12O6 → 3CO2 + 3CH4
Batch or continuous.
A batch system is the simplest form of digestion. Biomass is added to the reactor at the start of the process in a batch and is sealed for the duration of the process. Batch reactors suffer from odour issues that can be a severe problem when they are emptied. Typically biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. The operator can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. 
In continuous digestion processes organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed)or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; first in – first out). Here the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), low anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and Internal circulation reactors (IC).
Temperature
There are two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters, which are determined by the species of methanogens in the digesters:
• Mesophilic which takes place optimally around 30-38 °C or at ambient temperatures between 20-45 °C where mesophiles are the primary microorganisms present.
• Thermophilic which takes plae around 49-57 °C at elevated temperatures up to 70 °C where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present.
There are a greater number of species of mesophiles than thermophiles . These bacteria are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are therefore considered to be more stable than thermophilic
digestion systems.
As mentioned above, thermophilic digestion systems are considered to be less stable, the energy input is higher, and more energy is removed from the organic matter. However, the increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates and hence faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater sterilization of the end digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires end products to meet certain levels of reduction in the amount of bacteria in the output material, this may be a benefit.
Certain processes shred the waste finely and use a short high temperature and pressure pre-treatment (pasteurization / hygienisation) stage that significantly enhances the gas output of the following standard mesophilic stage. The hygienisation process is also applied in order to reduce the pathogenic micro-organisms in the feedstock. Hygienisation / pasteurization may be achieved by using a Landia BioChop hygienisation unit or similar method of combined heat treatment and solids maceration.
A drawback of operating at thermophilic temperatures is that more heat energy input is required to achieve the correct operational temperatures. This increase in energy may not be outweighed by the increase in the outputs of biogas from the systems. It is therefore important to consider an energy balance for these systems. 
There are three principal products of anaerobic digestion: biogas, digestate and water.
Typical composition of biogas
Matter %
Methane, CH4 50–75
Carbon dioxide, CO2 25–50
Nitrogen, N2 0–10
Hydrogen, H2 0–1
Hydrogen sulfide, H2S 0–3
Oxygen, O2 0–2
Power generation.
Biogas from sewage works is sometimes used to run a gas engine to produce electrical power; some or all of which can be used to run the sewage works. Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. It turns out that the waste heat is generally enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited.The scope for biogas generation from non-sewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste etc. is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000 MW.needed Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and strengthen the grid while providing farmers with additional revenues.
Some countries offer incentives in the form of, for example, Feed-in Tariffs for feeding electricity onto the power grid in order to subsidize green energy production.
In Jundiz it is burned methane from organic waste to generate electricity for 12,000 homes.
The transformation of waste into compost has been harnessed to generate electricity. And is that the smaller organic waste, 8,000 tons, were shut for a month in a tower to collect the methane produced in decomposition. The combustion of this gas move an alternator that generated six million kilowatts. This electricity, while supporting all of the recycling machinery, led light for 12,000 homes.
Finally it is noteworthy that already under construction to install a wind turbine will provide 10% of the electricity consumed by the plant.
The intended use is to energy, i.e. converting the waste into fuel which may be used in processes such as cement. This will replace traditional fuels such as diesel and minimizing what is currently sent to landfill Gardelegi.

Francis William Ramsbottom Isherwood (16 October 1851 – 30 April 1888) was an English sportsman who played international rugby union for England and first-class cricket.
Francis was the third son of Richard Ramsbottom Isherwood of Clewer Lodge and Reading, both in Berkshire, and his wife, Anna Clarendon, the daughter of William Cox of Windsor in New South Wales, Australia.
Isherwood made his only appearance for England in game against Scotland at Kennington Oval in 1872. His conversion helped England to a 2-1 win.
He also played five first-class cricket matches in 1872, as a fast-medium round arm bowler. His first match was for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University, but his four other first-class games were for Oxford.
Five of his seven career wickets were taken in the one match, against the Gentlemen of England, including a return of 4/52 in the first innings. His nephew, Lionel Isherwood, played first-class cricket in the 1920s.

El Cabanyal is a neighbourhood from the city of Valencia which is part of the sea village. It is located at the east part of the city, very near from La Malvarrosa, Valencia's main beach.
Remodelation.
The 24 July 1998, the local government of Rita Barberà, of the conservative People's Party approved a plan for extending the "Blasco Ibáñez avenue" to the sea. The plan implied the destruction of 1,651 houses all located into the Whole neighbourhood. The old fishing enclave of Cabanyal-Canyamelar, which was and is very deteriorated, is also considered a Heritage of Cultural Interest, so the plan couldn't be applied and the struggle between the Town Hall and the neighbours fighting against the destruction of their home lead to a social fracture that lasts for decades.
The main organization against Barberà's plans, Salvem el Cabanyal ("Save the Cabanyal", in valencian) worked as civical resistance and got some tactical victories at the courts. The Mayor of Valencia, Rita Barberà, even disqualified them by arguing that they were "violents", because "they summit judicial appeals".
The strategy of the Valencian council for taking the demolition ahead consisted in creating some public corporations (as "AUMSA" or "Cabanyal 2010"), which bought 500 of the houses in the area to be demolished, after pressuring the owners to sell their homes at low-prices. During the 2000 decade those houses were abandoned, and the Town Hall allowed drug-dealers to install there.
In 2007, Barberà's government send expropriation letters to all neighbours in Sant Pere's street, main artery in the affected area. Meanwhile, Las Provincias newspaper started a campaign against the citizens organized under "Salvem", damaging the cohabitation in the neighbourhood.
Despite law courts didn't allowed Barbera's plan in a protected area, People's Party used they majorities in both Town Hall council and autonomical government to modify laws in a sense that could allow the demolition. In April 2010, Rita Barberà approved, by decree, the demolition of the houses affected by the plan. Civical actions retarded the action of the bulldozers and finally the courts unauthorized the action. Despite this, about 125 houses were demolished, 28 of which were tiled at the very specific mood Cabanyal houses are tiled.
In 2013, the conflict in Cabanyal is still alive, poisoning the coexistence in the neighbourhood and damaging Barbera's image. That year, 272 tiled houses were catalogued, being 139 of those protected and 43 marked to be demolished by the expansion plan.

Sierra Salvada () is a mountain range situated to the northwest of Burgos (Spain), and it is also part of Alava and Orduña (an enclave on Biscay).
The southern slope of this mountain range, whose rivers flow to the mediterranean sea, is included in the province of Burgos. However, the north slope is part of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. The rivers of this area of Sierra Salvada flow to the Cantabrian coast.
Sierra Salvada is famous because of its peculiar shape, created by its north steep slope, in length, and because of its biodiversity, That is why Sierra Salvada is considered a Special Protection Area (SPA), in order to protect the different species of birds.
History.
Sierra Salvada is known through its limestone area and the speleological researches done there by the caving groups. Among the more than 350 caves located, there is the most famous one, The System of the Beech Forest of Ponata, cavity located and explored by the Speleological Group of Alava (GEA) between 1983 and 2000. This famous cave has length mapped. Other caves of this mountain range are the Pozalagua System, with length (explored and mapped by the Speleological Group of Alava and the Edelweiss Caving Group) and the San Miguel or the Old Cave.

Konkani ( ("kōṅkaṇī") ಕೊಂಕಣಿ ( "koṅkaṇi") കൊംകണി ( "konkaṇi") کونكنی ("kōnkanī") is a geographic group of dialects of the Konkani, a minority language spoken by the Konkani people of Karnataka and Kerala. The Karnataka dialects are referred to as Karnataka Konkani or Konkani from Karnataka. The Kerala dialects are referred to as Travancore Konkani or Kerala Konkani or simply Konkani from Kerala. Certain dialects like the Canara Saraswat dialects of the Gaud Saraswats and Bhanaps are called आमचीगॆलॆं "āmcigelẽ" (lit. ours) and the dialect of the Cochin Gaud Saraswats is called कॊच्चिमांय "koccimā̃y" (lit. mother Cochin) by the members of those communities. Konkani is a minority language in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtraand one of the official languages of India
.According to the 1991 Census, there are 7,06,397 Konkani speakers in Karnataka, 64,008 in Kerala and 3,12,618 who migrated from these areas in Maharashtra. Konkani epigraphy in Canara has been found dating 981 CE.
The word "Canara" is a Portuguese corruption of the word "Kannada". Konkani speaking communities from Canara usually distinguish themselves from their Goan counterparts by adding the prefix "Canara". e.g. Saraswats from Canara are call themselves Canara Saraswats and Christians, Canara Christians. The early Portuguese conquistadors referred to Konkani as "lingoa Canarim" as a reference to Canara.
Geographic distribution.
Canarese Konkani is mainly spoken as a minority language in the Indian States of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and some parts of Gujarat. The speakers are concentrated in the districts of Uttara Kannada district, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada in Karnataka, and, in districts of Cochin, Ernakulam, Alapuzha, Kollam, Calicut and Kasargod in Kerala. It also has a large diaspora in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom. Konkani is also spoken in Kenya, Uganda, U.A.E, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia and New Zealand.

According to the 1991 census of India, 40.1% Konkani speakers hail from the state of Karnataka. In Karnataka over 80% of them are from the coastal districts of North and South Kanara, including Udupi. 3.6% of the Konkani speakers are from Kerala, and nearly half of them are from Ernakulam district.
Based on local language influence, Konkani speaking people are classified into three main regions:
North Canara (Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka).
This is the region north of the Gangolli river, starts from the Kali river of Karwar. North Canarites are called "baḍgikār" (Northerners) or simply "baḍgi" in Konkani. North Canara Konkani has more of Goan Konkani influence than Kannada influence compared to South Canara Konkani. The major Konkani speaking communities include:
Karwar Konkani is different from Mangalorean or south Kanara konkani. It is similar to Goan Konkani but mixed with Kannada accented words.Although people of Karwar have their mother tongue as Konkani.Konkani speakers in North Canara are bilingual; they are well conversant in Kannada as well as Konkani. A few are conversant in Marathi too.
South Canara (Udupi and Mangalore districts, Karnataka).
This is the region south of the Gangolli river. South Canarites are called "ṭenkikār" (Southerner) "tenkabagli" or simply "ṭenki" in Konkani. The Rajapur Saraswat, Kudalkar, Daivajna, Kumbhar, Mangalorean Catholics, Gaud Saraswats and Chitrapur Saraswats are some of the Konkani speaking communities of this region. 33% of Dakshina Kannada speaks Konkani. South Canara Saraswats, both Gaud Saraswat and Chitrapur Saraswat affectionately refer to their dialect as "āmcigelẽ" (Ours)
This region has recently been bifurcated into Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts.
Konkani speakers in South Canara are trilingual; they are conversant in Konkani, Kannada and Tulu. Some are also conversant in Malayalam, especially speakers south of mangalore in towns like Manjeshwar, Ullal, Someshwar. Some of the towns in South Canara have separate Konkani names. Udupi is called "ūḍup" and Mangalore is called "koḍiyāl" in Konkani.
Travancore (Cochin and Ernakulam district, Kerala).
Konkani speakers are found predominantly in the Cochin and Ernakulam Alapuzha, Kollam districts of Kerala, the earstwhile kingdom of Travancore. Gaud Saraswat, Kudumbis, Vaishya Vani of Cochin, Daivajna and Mangalorean Catholics are the major communities. The Konkani dialect of the Gaud Saraswats is affectionately referred to as "koccimā̃y" by members of that community.
The Gaud Saraswats of Cochin were part of the group of "sāṣṭikār"s who migrated from Goa during the Inquisition hence their dialect is, but for usage of certain Malayalam words, similar to the dialect spoken by Gaud Saraswats of South Canara.
Konkani speakers in this region are bilingual; they are conversant in Konkani as well as Malayalam. Konkani in this region is peppered with Malayalam words.
Description.
Konkani in Karnataka has been in contact with Kannada, Tulu and Malayalam to some extent,thus showing Dravidian influence on its syntax. According to the linguists Konkani in Karnataka has undergone a process of "degenitivization",and is moving towards "dativization"on the pattern of Dravidian languages."Degenitivization" means the loss or replacement of the genitives,and "Dativization" means replacement of the genitive in the donor language (ie.Konkani) by the dative case marker in the recipient language(ie.Kannada).
The phonetics,sounds, nasalization, grammar,syntax and in turn vocabulary obviously differs from Goan Konkani.
In Karnataka Konkani present continuous tense is strikingly observable which is not so prominent in Goan Konkani.
Present indefinite of the auxiliary is fused with present participle of the primary verb,and the auxiliary is partially dropped. The southern dialects when came in contact with Dravidian languages this difference became more prominent in dialects spoken in Karnataka whereas Goan Konkani still retains the original form.
e.g.: I eat and I am eating sound similar in Goan Konkani,due to loss of auxiliary in colloquial speech.hāv khātā correspondeds to I am eating.On the other hand in Karnataka Konkani;hāv khātā corresponds to I eat,and hāv khātoāsā or hāv khāter āsā means I am eating.
There was a small population of Konkani speakers in Canara even before the first exodus from Goa. This group was responsible for the Shravanabelagola inscription. There was a large scale migration of Konkani communities from Goa to the coastal districts of North Canara, South Canara and Udupi as also the Shimoga district of Malnad region. This migration, caused by the persecution of the Bahamani and Portuguese rulers, took place between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries. Most of these migrants were merchants, craftsmen and artisans. These migrants were either Hindus, Muslims or Christians and their linguistic practices were influenced by this factor also. Each dialect is influenced by its geographical antecedents.
There are subtle differences in the way that Konkani is spoken in different regions: “In Karwar and Ankola, they emphasize the syllables, and in Kumta-Honavar, they use consonants in abundance. The Konkani spoken by Nawayatis of Bhatkal incorporates Persian and Arabic words. People of South Kanara do not distinguish between some nouns of Kannada and Konkani origin, and have developed a very business practical language. They sometimes add Tulu words also. It is but natural that Konkani has many social variations also because it is spoken by many communities such as Sonar, Serugar, Mestri, Sutar, Gabeet, Kharvi, Samgar, Nawayati, etc.The Konkani dialects spoken in Ernakulam incorporates Malayalam words.
There is a slight difference between the Konkani dialects spoken by the Christian and the Hindu communities. They are, however, mutually intelligible.
Continuous inter action between the Konkani speaking communities with Dravidian Languages over a period of time has resulted in influences at the levels of morphology, syntax, vocabulary and larger semantic units such as proverbs and idioms. This phenomenon is illustrated by Nadkarni, Bernd Heine and Tanya Kuteva in their writings.
Many Kannada words such as "duḍḍu" (money), "baḍḍi" (stick) and "bāgilu" (door) have found permanent places in Canarese Konkani. Canarese Konkani from Kerala has Malayalam words like sari/śeri (correct), etc.
These details do not take away the fact that Konkani is not a Dravidian language.
From the above table we see that South Canara and Kerala Hindu dialects undergo doubling of consonants "āppaytā" (calls), "dzāllẽ" (done), "kellẽ" (did), "vhaṇṇi" (sister in law) where Canara Catholic and North Canara Hindu dialects use the un-doubled ones "āpaytā", "dzālẽ", "kelẽ", "vhaṇi"' . The Gaud Saraswat and Kudumbi Kochi dialects uses " ca" and "ja" in place " tsa" and " dza" respectively.
Language structure.
Konkani speakers in Karnataka, having interacted with Kannada speakers in North Canara, Kannada and Tulu speakers in South Canara and Malayalam speakers in Kerala, their dialects have been influenced by Kannada, Tulu and Malayalam. This has resulted in Dravidian influence on their syntax. According to the linguists Konkani in Karnataka has undergone a process of degenitivisation, and is moving towards dativisation on the pattern of Dravidian languages.Degenitivisation means the loss or replacement of the genitives,and Dativisation means replacement of the genitive in the donor language (ie.Konkani) by the dative case marker in the recipient language(ie.Kannada). e.g.
The phonetics,sounds, nasalisation, grammar,syntax and in turn vocabulary differ from Goan Konkani.
In Karnataka Konkani present continuous tense is strikingly observable which is not so prominent in Goan Konkani.
Present indefinite of the auxiliary is fused with present participle of the primary verb,and the auxiliary is partially dropped. The southern dialects when came in contact with Dravidian languages this difference became more prominent in dialects spoken in Karnataka whereas Goan Konkani still retains the original form.e.g.
Early Konkani literature in Goa,Karnataka and Kerala has been found in the Nāgarī Script. At present however, Konkani in the Devanagari script has been promulgated as an Official Language. Nevertheless, Konkani is also written in the Roman, Kannada and Persian scripts.
Literature.
Early literature.
Amongst the inscriptions at the foot of the colossal statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka are two lines reading thus:
The first line was inscribed circa 981 AD and the second line in 116-17 AD. The language of these lines is Konkani according to Dr. S.B. Kulkarni (former head of Department of Marathi, Nagpur University) and Dr. Jose Pereira (former professor, Fordham University, US). Considering these arguments, these inscriptions at Sravanabelegola may be considered the earliest Konkani inscriptions in the Nāgarī script.
A piece of poetry attributed to the twelfth century and worded in Konkani runs as follows,
Medieval Literature.
It can be said beyond doubt, that nothing has been written for a long period up to 1900 which is an awareness, is perceived in the case of Konkani. The wilderness may be attributed to the lack of consciousness, amongst the Konkani speaking people, as to the importance of the preservation of records
The earliest known Konkani epigraphy is the rock inscription at Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. Another writing of antiquity is a रायसपत्र "Rāyasapatra" (writ) By Srimad Sumatindra Tirtha swamiji to his disciples.
In Konkani, Ramayana narration is found in both verse and prose. The story has been told in full or part in folksongs of the Kudubis and ritualistic forms like "goḍḍe rāmāyaṇ" of Kochi, "sītā suddi" and "sītā kalyāṇa" of Northern Kerala/South Canara and the "rāmāyaṇa raṇmāḷe" of Cancon. Some other texts of Ramayana too are available in written form in Konkani. rāmāyaṇācyo kāṇiyo, ascribed to Krishnadas Shama is in 16th century prose. During 1930s Late Kamalammal wrote the "raghurāmāyaṇa" in "vhōvi" style verse. There have also been an adapted version by late Narahari Vittal Prabhu of Gokarn and recently, the translation of rāmacaritramānasa by Kochi Ananta Bhat of Kochi.
Hortus Malabaricus (meaning Garden of Malabar) is a comprehensive treatise that deals with the medicinal properties of the flora in the Indian state of Kerala. Originally written in Latin, it was compiled over a period of nearly 30 years and published from Amsterdam during 1678–1693. The book was conceived by Hendrik van Rheede, who was the Governor of the Dutch administration in Kochi (formerly Cochin) at the time.
Though the book was the result of the indomitable will power of Hendrik Van Rheede, all the basic work and the original compilation of plant properties was done by three Konkani Physicians of Kochi, namely Ranga Bhat, Vināyaka Pandit and Appu Bhat. The three have themselves certified this in their joint certificate in Konkani, which appears as such at the start of the first volume of the book.
This book also contains the Konkani names of each plant, tree and creeper are also included throughout the book, in all 12 volumes, both in its descriptive parts and alongside their respective drawings. While the names are in Roman script in the descriptive part, the names alongside the diagrams are in original Nāgarī script itself, indicated as Bramanical characters.
The 17th century certificate was etched in the manner and style of those times, which may appear unfamiliar now. Further to this, some writing notations (mostly anuswara) are seen missing in the print. Hence, to make it easily readable, the body matter is reproduced herein with enhanced clarity, modern-day spacing between words, and with the missing notations added back, for the sake of coherence and comprehension.
The credit for documenting Konkani in Canara goes to The Italian Jesuit Fr. Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei, who studied the Konkani language of the Mangalorean Catholics of South Canara. He wrote two books, English-Konkani dictionary and thereafter a book on Konkani Grammar, in 1882. In 1883 he wrote "koṅkaṇi rānāntulo sōbīt sundar tāḷo" ("A sweet voice from the Konkani Desert" ) in 1893.
The captivity of sixty thousand Kanara Christians in 1784 by Tipu Sultan and their deportation and shipment in Srirangapatnam for more than 15 years testified as a boon in disguise for evolvement of Konkani literature in Karnataka. Several of the prisoners carried along with them hymns and other folklore to keep them going amidst dreadful surroundings. The well known hymn "riglo jedzu maḷeyānt" (Jesus entered the garden of Gethsemane) was most likely composed by Fr Joachim Miranda in the 18th century. Foundation of Konkani literature was primarily laid in these hymns. By the middle of the 19th century, Konkani Christians had grounded themselves into a well-knit and well-to-do community in and around the city of Mangalore.
The Dvaita seer Madhavacharya converted Smartha Konkani Gaud Saraswats to Dvaitism. This Dvaita Gaud Saraswat community was instrumental in "kīrtanasāhitya "and "haridāsasāhitya". Vasudev Prabhu was a very famous Konkani poet of the Bhakti Movement. He wrote many devotional songs in Konkani and also translated Kannada devotional poetry of Vyāsarāya, Naraharitirtha, Puranadaradāsa, Kanakadāsa. These Konkani songs were, later, sung by nārāyantirtha
Contemporary Literature.
The year 1912 witnessed the birth of the first periodical in Mangalore, the Konkani Dirvem, under the very much advancing and shining Konkani literature in Karnataka. Louis Mascarenhas and U Kannappa were the founders of this periodical. In 1938, the periodical named Rakhno was started in Mangalore. The year 1950 remained a witness to the birth of the first full-length, original social nover Angel by Joaquim Santan Alvares. He in fact had revolutionised the field of fiction in Konkani literature from Karnataka and subsequently penned numerous awe-inspiring novels. V J P Saldanha, popularly acknowledged as Khadap, has authored novels pretty much containing a powerful plot, characterisation and style of diction. Chafra, also acknowledged as C F D'Costa, has made applaudable contribution in the genres of poetry and plays. Some other prominent writers in Konkani literature from Karnataka comprise: A T Lobo, Edwin D Souza, Stan Ageira, Gabriel D'Souza or Gabbu, Ronald Pereira, Jerry Kulshekar, Irene Pinto, Tina D'Mello, Mic Max, Vitor Rodrigues, Francis Saldanha, Hemachandra, etc.
Pedro John D'Souza, Faustin D'Souza, J U Rego, J C Viegas, Nandini D' costa, C G Pereira, Sylvester D"Souza, Francis Saldanha and other have penned emphatic short stories under Konkani literature in Karnataka. Another hugely captivating factor in this Karnataka Konkani literature is their supreme interest in poetry, which is acknowledged to be verily deep rooted. The early groundbreakers in this field were in actuality, the Catholic priests, who had sailed long long time back. They have handed down to their succeeding generations numerous hymns, which were poems in effect. They were further passed down to the other generations by word of mouth. Louis Mascarenhas was a great poet, in the context of Konkani literature from early Karnataka. Other prominent poets from this Konkani genre comprise: Fr P L Notelho, Fr Sylvester Menezes, Fr Anthony John D'Souza, Fr Pratap Naik, Ambrose D'Souza, Lancelot Pinto, Elo D'Souza, J B Sequeira, Ambrose D'Souza, J B Rasquina and Henry D'Silva, J B Moraes, C F D'Costa.
Contemporary Konkani literature in Kerala made a rather late entry, as compared to its other concentrated states like Karnataka. However, according to historical annals, there can be established no exact evidence to relate exactly when Konkani language and literature began its predominating journey in Kerala. But a possible contact and interlinking between Goa with Kerala cannot be thrown to the wind, as collaborators in foreign trade. G Kamalammal is known to have contributed whole-heartedly to Konkani literature, in the domain of devotional writing. V. Krishna Vadyar, Bhakta R Kanhangad, S. T Chandrakala, S Kamat are some of the most renowned novelists in the Konkani dialect. Moving further ahead, V Venkates, K Narayan Naik, N Prakash and others have penned forceful short stories; P G Kamath has contributed to the sphere of essay writing.
Some of the most great and legendary poets in Konkani literature from Kerala, comprise: K Anant Bhat, N Purushottam Mallya, R Gopal Prabhu, P N S Sivanand Shenoy, N N Anandan, R S Bhaskar etc. Translations, folklore, criticism also have enriched the Konkani literature in Kerala.Stepping aside a little bit and directing the attention towards analytic and detailed study, Konkani literature in Kerala has been legendary and celebrated to have formulated dictionaries and encyclopedias in considerable numbers.
Culture, media and arts.
Konkani speakers have retained their language and culture in Karnataka and Kerala. Music, theatre and periodicals keep these communities in touch with the language.
Notable periodicals are "rākṇo, pāntskadāyi, divo, paiṇāri and sansakār bōdh".
Konkani theatre made a rather late entry into the Indian art scenario. Konkani thearte groups like" rangakarmi kumbaḷe śrīnivās bhaṭ pratiṣṭhān, sant judze nāṭak sabhe, raṅgayōgi rāmānand cūryā vēdike, māṇḍ sobhāṇ" played an instrumental role in bringing Konkani theatre to the masses. "raṅgakarmi "Kumble Shrinivas Bhat, Late Hosad Babuti Naik, Late Cha. Fra. D’Costa, Late Late K. Balakrishna Pai ("kuḷḷāppu"), Sujeer Srinivas Rao ("cinna kāsaragōḍ") and Vinod Gangolli are some noteworthy names. Ramananda Choorya was an eminent artist who encouraged people to develop Konkani theatre. He wrote the famous play "dōni ghaḍi hāssunu kāḍi". Some other notable theatre-plays are "paiśāntso sansār , jêkpoṭ jana, bā‌vuḷẽ phūl, tsōru guru tsāṇḍāḷa śiṣya, kāḷki rāta, śānti nivās, dharmam śaraṇam gacchāmi, gāṇṭi, kāḷakā phāṭlẽ udzvāḍa, hāsanātilo to piso".
Konkani films are rarely made in Karnataka and Kerala." tapasvini and jana mana," ujwadu are the only three films in the "āmcigelẽ " dialect. '"mog āni mayapās, bhogasāṇe, kāzārā uprānt, pādri " are films in the South Kanara Christian dialect.
Konkani in schools.
Konkani has been initiated as the third language in Karnataka and Kerala due to efforts by Konkani promoting organisations. Government of Karnataka has introduced Konkani as a subject and provided textbooks. However due to lack of qualification, avenues hereto to Konkani teachers, it has not provided grants to schools for appointing Konkani Language teachers.
The Mangalore-based Konkani Language and Culture Foundation is approaching this issue with a two prong approach and hopes to achieve government grants to schools to appoint teachers for Konkani language.
Though the Government of Karnataka has introduced Konkani as a subject (optional third language 6th Std onwards) in some schools of a few districts of Karnataka, it does not give any grant to appoint teachers for teaching Konkani. This has been an obstacle in promoting the Konkani language in schools.
The Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation has initiated a project to appoint Konkani teachers to teach Konkani in schools managed by Konkani people in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada.
Beginning of academic year 2010–11, the Foundation will appoint 10 teachers on a trial basis and lend their services to Konkani management schools. The teachers will be given regular training and coaching on monthly basis. These teachers will not only teach Konkani language but also train the students in Konkani art and culture i.e. singing, dance and acting in Konkani drama.
This scheme will involve:
Though the World Konkani Centre will appoint the teachers and disburse monthly salaries, school managements look after the discipline, attendance, quality of teaching and attitude of the teacher allotted to their schools.
This project looks at establishing an academic base to Konkani in the School Education System. The" Teacher Education" dimension of the Konkani Language is evolved afresh and strengthened adequately through a systematic scholastic exercise. In order to achieve this, a series of thinking is prescribed which could be treated as a Road Map for setting up disciplinary status to Konkani Teaching Methodology in Teacher Training Institutes and thus pave the way for producing efficient Konkani Teachers through preliminary meetings with scholars and academicians. A series of workshops will be organised to develop the resource material for Konkani teaching methodology.
In Kerala 2009 Aug. Govt. has instructed to SCERT to prepare curriculum and textbook to introduce Konkani from standard V to X. Also Govt. expects to introduce the same in 2011–12 academic year in std V.
Konkani organisations in Karnataka and Kerala.
Konkani well wishers in Kerala established the Kochi based Kerala Konkani Academy in 1980. Konkani language in the state of Karnataka is regulated by the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Academy, Mangalore established by the government of Karnataka in 1994. Co-ordinating and liaising with these are private and semi-governmental organisations like Konkani Bhashoddhara Trust, Konkani Parishad (Kumta), Karnataka State Konkani Linguistic Minority Educational Institutions Association, Dr T.M.A. Pai Foundation, Konkani Bhasha Mandal, Karnataka, Mand Sobhann (Kalangann) in Karnataka, and Konkani Bhasha Prachar Sabha (Kochi), Konkani Bhasha Pratisthan (Kozhikode) in Kerala.The Mumbai based Konkani Bhasha Mandal is a private organisation in Maharashtra.
Govt. of Kerala has taken a step ahead to establish Konkani Sahithya Akademy (Konkani Akademy) by issuing a G.O in Oct 2011, to constitute an Advisory committee which includes 16 persons from Kerala.
In addition to these there are educational institutions which have Konkani language departments, notable amongst which are Department of Konkani Studies (1992) at St. Aloysius College (Mangalore) and Saraswat Education Society's (1870) Ganapathi High School. Sukrathindra Oriental Research Institute (1974) is a Notable Kochi based organisation.

Shahbaz Bhatti

Clement Shahbaz Bhatti (9 September 19682 March 2011), popularly known as Shahbaz Bhatti, was a Pakistani politician and elected member of the National Assembly from 2008. He was the first Federal Minister for Minorities Affairs from November 2008 until his assassination on 2 March 2011 in Islamabad. Bhatti, a Roman Catholic, was an outspoken critic of Pakistan's blasphemy laws and the only Christian in the Cabinet. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for his killing and called him a blasphemer of Muhammad.
Early life.
Bhatti was born in Lahore to Christian (Catholic) parents from the village of Khushpur, Faisalabad. His father, Jacob Bhatti, served in the army, then as a teacher, before becoming chairman of the board of churches in Khushpur. Shahbaz Bhatti was unmarried; he had four brothers and one sister.
Career.
As a student, Bhatti founded and served as head of Pakistan's Christian Liberation Front, which he formed in 1985. He later helped to found the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance (APMA) in 2002 and was unanimously elected as its chairman. He met with President Pervez Musharraf as part of a group of minority rights advocates. Bhatti joined the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in 2002, but remained outside politics until becoming a minister in 2008. He was placed on the government's Exit Control List in 2003, but was removed in November of that year.
Bhatti was appointed as Federal Minister for Minorities Affairs on 2 November 2008, when, for the first time, the post was elevated to cabinet level and an independent ministry created. At the time, he said that he accepted the post for the sake of the "oppressed, down-trodden and marginalized" of Pakistan, and that he had dedicated his life to the "struggle for human equality, social justice, religious freedom, and to uplift and empower religious minorities' communities." He added that he wanted to send "a message of hope to the people living a life of disappointment, disillusionment and despair", and also stated his commitment to reforming the country's blasphemy laws.
During his time as federal minister, he took numerous steps in support of religious minorities. These included the launch of a national campaign to promote interfaith harmony, the proposal of legislation to ban hate speech and related literature, the proposed introduction of comparative religion as a curriculum subject, the introduction of quotas for religious minorities in government posts and the reservation of four Senate seats for minorities. Bhatti also spearheaded the organisation of a National Interfaith Consultation in July 2010, which brought together senior religious leaders of all faiths from across Pakistan and resulted in a joint declaration against terrorism.
Assassination.
Bhatti had been the recipient of death threats since 2009, when he spoke in support of Pakistani Christians attacked in the 2009 Gojra riots in Punjab Province. These threats increased following his support for Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian sentenced to death in 2010 for blasphemy. The United States had tried to obtain increased security for him and get him an armoured car but was unsuccessful. Bhatti himself foretold his death and recorded a video, which was to be released in case of his death, where he said "I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us, and I am ready to die for a cause. I'm living for my community ... and I will die to defend their rights."
According to the BBC, Bhatti was travelling to work through a residential district, having just left his mother's home, when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets. At the time of the attack he was alone, without any security. His driver reports having stopped the car and ducked when he saw armed men approaching rather than attempting to evade the threat. Bhatti was taken to a nearby hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. The group Tehrik-i-Taliban told the BBC that they carried out the attack, because Bhatti was a "known blasphemer." A Roman Catholic who had criticised Pakistan's blasphemy law, his death follows that of Punjab governor Salman Taseer, who was also assassinated amid the controversy over the blasphemy law.
On the day following Bhatti's assassination, hundreds of Christian demonstrators reportedly took to the streets across Punjab, with protesters burning tires and demanding justice. According to Minorities Concern of Pakistan, "Investigators are divided over the assassination case with some in the Islamabad police pointing the fingers at the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Later in 2011, an attempt was also made to shift the blame to "internal squabbles" among Christians. According to the same group, Bhatti's murderer is still unknown. Minority groups in Pakistan are demanding the formation of a commission to probe the Bhatti case.
Reactions.
Leaders of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Spain, UK, USA, the Vatican expressed their shock and condemnation of his killing.

<doc id="31055197" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31055197" title="Maiko">
Maiko

Origin.
Maiko originated from women who served green tea and "dango" (Japanese dumpling made from rice flour) to people who visited the "Kitano Tenman-gū" or "Yasaka Shrine" (these are the two of the famous shrines in Kyoto) at teahouses in the temple town about 300 years ago.
At first, women served only green tea and dango, but they gradually started to perform songs and dances for visitors.
Appearance.
A maiko's hairstyle is called "nihongami" (a Japanese traditional hairstyle from Edo period.) They arrange their hairstyle with their own hair. Maiko put "kanzashi" (Japanese traditional hair accessories) on their hair with seasonal flowers. The hairstyle changes depending on the years of experience they have.
Maiko wear "kimono" with the train trailing on the floor. They wear "darari-no-obi" (the special "obi" for maiko) over the train, which is five meters long and it hangs from their waist to their ankles.
Jobs.
In the morning, maiko take lessons to polish their performances. At night, they go out to work. They are usually given the opportunity to eat at high-class Japanese-style restaurants or stay in Japanese-style hotels. They perform dances, songs, play the "shamisen", and serve visitors with "sake". Recently, their jobs have expanded to include visiting nursing institutions or hospitals. Some maiko are also dispatched overseas.

Raylton Dixon

Major Sir Raylton George Fenwick Dixon, 9th Baronet Hyewortone (8 July 1838–28 July 1901), was a shipbuilding magnate of Middlesbrough on the River Tees. He was one of the seven children of Jeremiah II Dixon (1804–1882) and Mary Frank (1803–1877) of Cockfield, County Durham who were married on 21 July 1833 in St. Cuthberts, Darlington. He was the great-grandson of George Dixon of Cockfield Canal fame, and great, great nephew of Jeremiah Dixon.
Business life.
He was Educated at Eton College and Trinity Collage, Oxford, where he studied Mathematics.
The yard first did business under the name "Backhouse & Dixon". Raylton Dixon started the firm of Raylton Dixon & Co. in 1873 with the substantial Dixon family coal mining fortune, and it operated until 1923 when it was dissolved. At the height of its production the three Dixon brothers, Raylton, John, and Waynman, were involved in running the company. During its 50 year life the Cleveland Dockyard built more than 600 vessels, the first ship, the iron steamer "SS Torrington", being launched in 1874. The ship was later renamed the "SS Kwanon Maru No. 11" and ran aground and was wrecked off Yagoshi Point, Hokkaido on 7 March 1908. Raylton Dixon & Co earned a reputation for the construction of sound, large cargo-liners and during the 1890s had contracts with all the major shipping companies of the time. They also turned out refrigerated ships for the meat industry. 
Dixon was a close friend of George Young Blair (1826–1894), whose firm, Blair & Co., built marine triple expansion engines and were fitted in Raylton Dixon ships.
Raylton Dixon ships played an important role in world history. The was built in 1897 as a refrigerated cargo steamer, accommodating 12 first-class passengers. In 1900 she was chartered to make eight voyages to Cape Town, ferrying the Dublin & Denbigh Imperial Yeomanry, with their horses, to the Anglo-Boer War. In 1904 Doctor Crippen and his secretary, Ethel Le Neve, were aboard the ship and acted suspiciously, causing the master to radio Liverpool, resulting in their arrest on the St. Lawrence River. In 1914 she was sold to the admiralty for use as a blockship in Dover harbour, but broke her moorings during a gale and ran aground on the Goodwin Sands, her mast remaining visible until 1963. The general cargo steamer SS "Mont-Blanc" built at Raylton Dixon in 1899 devastated Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada when she blew up with a cargo of ammunition in the 1917 Halifax Explosion.
Raylton Dixon was knighted in 1890 for his contributions to shipbuilding.
Personal life.
Raylton Dixon married Elizabeth Walker, daughter of Robert Walker, on 5 Aug 1863. Elizabeth was born in 1841 and died in 1915 aged 74. They produced eight children: Mary Alice Elizabeth Raylton, Florence Lilian, Bessie May Raylton, Ada Beatrice Averil Raylton, Clive Macdonnell Raylton, Mabel Cochrane, Harald Raylton and Amy Gertrude Inga Raylton.
Raylton Dixon was buried in St Cuthbert's Marton Church yard.

Ministry of Minorities (Pakistan)

The Ministry of Minorities used to be a federal-level ministry in the Government of Pakistan. The head of the ministry was known as the Minister for Minorities and was a member of the federal cabinet.
Until September 2004, the functions of this ministry were carried out by the Minorities Wing of the former Ministry of Minorities, Culture, Sports, Tourism and Youth Affairs - but it remained underfunded for some time. This changed when it was upgraded to a fully-fledged, independent Ministry of Minorities, founded under President Musharraf.
In November 2008, the government (then led by the Pakistan People's Party (PPP)) invested in a larger ministry and renamed it the Ministry of Minorities Affairs. The role of minister was awarded to a Christian activist, Shahbaz Bhatti, who served in this position until March 2, 2011, when he was assassinated in Islamabad.
In July 2011, the Government of Pakistan closed the Minorities Affairs Ministry as part of a decentralization plan that would see powers in this area transferred to the provinces. However, a new ministry was created with almost the same remit but under a different name, the Ministry for National Harmony. Shahbaz Bhatti's brother, Paul Bhatti, was appointed to lead it, as a "Special Advisor" to the Prime Minister.
In June 2013, under a newly elected government led by the Pakistan Muslim League (N), the Ministry of National Harmony was merged with a larger ministry, the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Some argue that this weakens minority representation at the highest level. Others say it is a positive move to 'mainstream' minority concerns and avoid marginalisation.

Şehzade Korkut

Şehzade Korkut (1467–1513) was an Ottoman prince who was a short time regent for the Ottoman throne.
Early years.
He was born in Amasya (in Turkey) in 1467. His father was Beyazıt II. There is no consensus on the name of his mother. She was either a certain Nigar Hatun or Gülbahar Hatun. If the latter is true, he was the full brother of sultan Selim I. When his grandfather Mehmet II died in 1481, he was the oldest Ottoman prince residing in Istanbul. As such, he served as the regent for the throne for 18 days until his father Beyazıt II arrived in İstanbul.
As a governor.
According to Ottoman tradition, all princes () were required to work as provincial (sanjak) governors (sanjak-bey) as a part of their training. In 1491, Korkut was appointed as the governor of Saruhan sanjak (Manisa in modern Turkey). In 1502, he was appointed as the governor of Teke (Antalya in modern Turkey), a port on Mediterranean coast. Antalya was much farther from Istanbul than Manisa, and Korkut interpreted this appointment as a sign of disfavor by his father, the sultan. He asked for his former seat; upon refusal in 1509, he escaped to Egypt under the pretext of pilgrimage. Egypt was under Mamluk rule, and he was welcomed by the Mamluk sultans. His father considered this a sign of negligence on Korkut's part, but pardoned him, and Korkut returned Ottoman lands. During his voyage to back home, the Knights Hospitalier attacked his ship and attempted to capture him, but Korkut managed to escape from the knights and return home safely.
Beginning of the interregnum.
Beyazıt was now old and ailing. Korkut decided to move to Manisa to be closer to the capital. During this travel, a part of his treasury was raided by the rebels of Şahkulu. Later, he secretly traveled to Istanbul to have a role in the coming interregnum between his siblings. However, he found almost no supporters in the capital. He met with his brother Selim, who convinced him to return to his sanjak. Korkut then gave up all of his claims to the throne and took no part in the civil war between his two brothers (Şehzade Ahmet and Selim I).
Death.
Selim I became the new sultan in 1512. Korkut readily accepted his brother's reign. Nevertheless, distrustful Selim decided to test his loyalty by sending him fake letters from various bureaucrats of the empire that attempted to encourage him to take part in a rebellion against Selim. Feeling that Korkut was preparing to revolt, Selim had Korkut executed in 1513 near Emet (around Kütahya in Turkey). He was buried in Bursa.

Strength and conditioning coach

A strength and conditioning coach is a fitness professional who uses exercise prescription specifically to improve performance in athletic competition. Strength coaches also help athletes with injury prevention and proper mechanics within their sports performances.
Employment characteristics.
Strength and conditioning coaches typically work with sports teams, but may also work with individuals. Strength and conditioning coaches are also often employed by higher education institutions and professional athletic teams.
While some strength and conditioning coaches may specialize in a certain sports team, type of performance, training type, or training philosophy, many at the collegiate level must work with any team to which they are assigned. In general, most strength and conditioning coaches develop exercise prescription plans that specifically modulate aerobic, resistance, and/or flexibility training to suit the metabolic and physical demands of the sport in question. With aerobic exercise prescription, strength and conditioning coaches determine the type of exercise, duration of exercise, frequency, and duration. For resistance exercise prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined. They may also be involved in prescription of stretching routines or other approaches. Nutrition and medical consultation are not within their scope of practice and training qualifications.
Effectiveness of strength and conditioning coaches.
Research has demonstrated that not only does training improve performance but that incorrect training (distance running, a slow-twitch muscle fiber activity, in football athletes with fast-twitch characteristics) can cause decrements to performance. Using techniques such as plyometrics in some high-power athletes and sports-specific movements in others, strength coaches may improve physical function and athletic performance.
Qualification standards.
The National Strength and Conditioning Association and The UK Strength and Conditioning Association offer a Certified Strength and Conditioning Coach qualification that is usually required for positions in the field. In addition to the C.S.C.S. certification needed to become a strength and conditioning coach, a Bachelor's degree is also required.

Jacques-Louis Copia

Jacques-Louis Copia, a French engraver, was born at Landau in 1764. He went to Paris, and among other plates executed a charming little portrait of Queen Marie Antoinette, after Piauger, which is very rare. He also engraved a head of Marat, terribly startling in its ghastliness, from a drawing made by David immediately after his assassination. But Copia is chiefly identified with Prud'hon, the voluptuous genius of whose works no one has more fully comprehended. It must, however, be admitted that, apart from the great painter, Copia would have remained hidden in the crowd. His style was neither original nor brilliant, and his rare qualities of modelling and softness of execution required works suitable for their display. He died in Paris in 1799, unfortunately too early to be able to engrave the greatest works of his friend. But among other pupils he left one, Roger, who caught his manner, and is thought by many to have surpassed his master in the interpretation of the spirit of Prud'hon.
The following are the works of Prud'hon which have been engraved by Copia:

The Trip (band)

The Trip were a British-Italian progressive rock band of the early 1970s. While their career was less successful than those of Italian progressive rock prominent bands such as Premiata Forneria Marconi or Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, they were very popular for a few years, and were very appreciated by the critics, especially because of their talented leader, keyboard player Joe Vescovi, who is often referred to as the Italian counterpart of Keith Emerson. The band is also notable as British guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was in the The Trip's personnel before joining Deep Purple.
History.
The band was established in London in 1966, when Riki Maiocchi of I Camaleonti fame decided to create a new band to explore the new opportunities brought about by the advent of psychedelic rock. In London, Maiocchi had met with Ian Broad, who joined in Maiocchi's project; they also recruited Ritchie Blackmore (on guitar), Arvid "Wegg" Andersen (bass and vocals) and William Gray (also on guitar). The band debuted in Italy as "Maiocchi and the Trip". Blackmore left in December 1966 and returned to London where he continued as a session musician until 1968 when he joined Deep Purple. He was replaced by Luciano Galdolfi. When Gandolfi, Maiocchi, and Broad left, new and fundamental additions were made to the personnel, namely Joe Vescovi (keyboards) and Pino Sinnone (drums).
In 1970, the band (who had been renamed "The Trip") signed for RCA Italiana, releasing their first, eponymous album. At the time, progressive rock was still not clearly defined as a genre; "The Trip" is in fact a rather traditional rock and blues album. Also in 1970, the band was featured in a surrealistic Italian movie by the title "".
The Trip's second release "Caronte" (1971) was a major shift towards progressive rock. It was a concept album which blended mythological themes, structured compositions, and virtuoso keyboard playing by Vescovi. "Caronte" included songs that paid tribute to rock giants Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.
After "Caronte", Gray and Sinnone left; a new drummer was hired, Furio Chirico. This line-up released "Atlantide" (1972); at the time, The Trip had become a trio (keyboards, bass, and drums) and their overall sound came as close as ever to that of Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In 1973 that same lineup released the last official album of the band, "Time of Change", this time with label Trident. This too was a mythology-themed concept album, with a sound that blended progressive rock and jazz elements.
After "Time of Change" the group disbanded, with Chirico leaving to establish his own band Arti e Mestieri, that also had some success in the Italian progressive rock scene. Vescovi joined band Acqua Fragile and then Dik Dik, one of the most popular Italian pop-rock bands of the time.
The band reunited briefly in 2010 (with a line-up consisting of Vescovi, Andersen, and Chirico, along with new members Fabrizio Chiarelli and Angelo Perini) to participate in progressive rock festival "Prog Exhibition" (held in Rome in 5–6 November). The band's live performance from this festival has been released within the CD/DVD boxed set "Prog Exhibition: 40 anni di musica immaginifica".
Founding member of the group, bass player and singer Arvid "Wegg" Andersen died in 2012. His memory was honoured by a concert in Alassio featuring, among others, an incarnation of The Trip with special guests.

Cornelius Cole Smith, Jr.

Dr. Cornelius Cole "Corney" Smith, Jr. (July 18, 1913 – April 27, 2004) was an American author, military historian, illustrator and painter. A survivor of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was an officer in the United States Marines during World War II and retired at the rank of Colonel. Smith's father, Medal of Honor recipient Cornelius Cole Smith, Sr., also served as a colonel in the Philippines during the Philippine Insurrection and Moro rebellion. 
After leaving military service in 1947, he held a number of important positions including his employment as an architect for the Arabian-American Oil Company and a museum curator for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. After receiving his MA and Ph.D. degrees in history at Claremont Graduate School, he spent the 1950s as chief of the Historical Division for the 15th Air Force, Strategic Air Command.
He began his writing career relatively late in life, at age 57, and was a prolific author of books on military history and the American frontier of the Southwestern United States. In addition to his own father's biography, "Don't Settle for Second: Life and Times of Cornelius C. Smith" (1977), he also authored biographies on Arizona frontiersman William Sanders Oury and Russian soldier-of-fortune Emilio Kosterlitzky. His book "A Southwestern Vocabulary: The Words They Used" (1984) detailed over 500 terms of slang of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico and is widely cited by historians of the "Old West".
Early life.
Cornelius Cole Smith Jr. was born at Fort Huachuca in Arizona on July 18, 1913. His father, Cornelius Cole Smith, Sr., was commanding officer of the 5th U.S. Cavalry at the time of his birth. Smith came from a prominent military family whose lineage could be traced as far back as the American Revolutionary War; his grandfather, Gilbert Cole Smith, had served an officer in the Union Army's famed California Column during the American Civil War and was also a direct descendant of brothers Granville and William Sanders Oury, William being one of couriers sent out by Colonel William B. Travis' during the Siege of the Alamo.
His early life growing up on the frontier military post was described by childhood friend H. B. Wharfield in his 1968 book "Fort Yuma on the Colorado River", 
A few years following his father's retirement from the military, he and his family moved to Riverside, California in 1930, where they lived in the historic Victorian Charles E. Packard House; the home remained in the Smith family for over 30 years before Cornelius, Jr. sold it in 1963. Cornelius Smith, Jr. graduated from Riverside Polytechnic High School the following year. He briefly attended Riverside City College where he earned a track scholarship to the University of Southern California, and graduated in 1937.
Military service during World War II.
The year of his college graduation, Smith became a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps Reserve as a second lieutenant. He was present at the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, where he was serving as officer of the day at the Marine barracks in the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. He was initially alerted of the attack by the officer of the guard, Second Lieutenant Arnold D. Swartz, while drinking coffee with Marine Gunner Floyd McCorkle in the officers' section of the mess hall. As "sharp blasts" began shaking the building, the three men ran out onto the lanai where they witnessed the first Japanese naval planes diving on Ford Island.
During the attack, he led a four-man rescue party which pulled between fifteen and twenty sailors from oil-soaked and burning water; he modestly recounted his actions in later years saying only that his rescue party did "pretty good". He searched in vain among the wounded and dying at the Naval Hospital for his friend Harry Gaver, Jr., son of Black-Foxe Military Institute commandant Major Harry Gaver, who had been killed on the USS Oklahoma earlier that morning. He later said, while standing among Marines firing at enemy planes flying over the Navy Yard, that "every Leatherneck's face wore a look of shame"; "Here we are with our pants down and the striking force of our Pacific Fleet is settling on the bottom of East Loch, Pearl Harbor. Who wouldn't be ashamed?" He wrote a personal account of the battle, based on his own wartime diary, for the Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute, "...A Hell of a Christmas," (December 1968) years later. 
From May 1941 to October 1945, Smith served overseas and held commands at all levels from a platoon to a battalion. He spent much of his time in the Philippines where his father had served, as an officer with the 14th U.S. Cavalry, during the Philippine Insurrection and Moro rebellion at the turn of the 20th century.
Post-war life.
In 1947, Smith retired from active duty at the rank of Colonel and subsequently became an architect for the Arabian-American Oil Company. He also worked as a museum curator for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In the 1950s, after earning MA and Ph.D. degrees in history at Claremont Graduate School, he was appointed chief of the Historical Division for the 15th Air Force, Strategic Air Command. He authored his two three books during this period, "A Study of the Development of the Petroleum Industry in Saudi Arabia: Its Impact Upon the Economic and Social Patterns of That Country" (1953) and "United States Policy in Spain and the Mediterranean Area: An Analysis of the Economic and Military Agreements of 1953" (1955), the former partially based on his experiences employed by the Arabian-American Oil Company. 
Work as an historian.
Smith began contributing to various historical publications, such as "Montana: The Magazine of Western History", in the early-1960s and wrote his first book, "Recuerdos de San Antonio: Four Memorable Days in the City of the Alamo", in 1964. He became a full-time author and illustrator three years later publishing a biography on his great-grandfather William Sanders Oury in "William Sanders Oury: History-Maker of the Southwest" (1967); the book was favorably reviewed by Frontier Times, a magazine his father had written articles for during the early 1930s. That same year, he was invited to speak at the Archives and State and Local History Round Table luncheon. Smith followed this with "Emilio Kosterlitzky, Eagle of Sonora and the Southwest Border" in 1970 and had his first poetry book, "Wanderlust", published in 1974. As an artist Smith produced works painted primarily in watercolor. 
In the mid-1970s, Smith returned to his childhood home of Fort Huachuca to serve as the post's centennial coordinator. Near the end of the decade, he wrote another series of books on the American frontier in the Southwest with a biography on his father, "Don't Settle for Second: Life and Times of Cornelius C. Smith" (1977), as well as "Tanque Verde: The Story of a Frontier Ranch" (1978) and "Fort Huachuca: The Story of a Frontier Post" (1978). His last such book, "A Southwestern Vocabulary: The Words They Used" (1984), described in detail the origins, meanings, and use of over 500 terms of historical slang of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico. Smith then moved on to writing about the local history of Riverside, California. His first effort was "All Saints Episcopal Parish, Riverside, California: The First 100 Years, A Brief History" (1984) and continued with "Remembrance of Things Past" (1991) and "Corney's Mission Inn" (1993).
Later years.
Though he and his wife, Grace Mantel Smith, had been stationed all across the country during his military career Smith always maintained a home in Riverside and eventually retired there. Since the 1960s, he had been an active musician and sang tenor for the Citrus Belt Chapter of The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America. His sister, Alice Smith Randolph, also sang at the Mission Inn. In his retirement years, he became known in the local community as a modern-day "renaissance man", focusing on sculptures and artwork, and had numerous one-man shows of his paintings and wood carvings. Two of his last books were related to his art and poetry, "Full Circle: Poems & Drawings" (1998) and "Impressions ... of Places and Things" (1999).
In October 2003, as one of the oldest residents in the city, he made a public appearance at Evergreen Memorial Park for a special ceremony to commemorate the restoration of his father's gravesite; this was part of an Eagle Scout project by 16-year-old Michael Emett to restore the dilapidated historical section of the cemetery. In an interview with "The Press-Enterprise", he talked about his father, "I was always proud of him and I always looked up to him. He was a fine man. He was a great man."
Smith died of natural causes at his Riverside home on April 27, 2004, at the age of 90. A military service was held for him at Evergreen Memorial Park, where he was interred, as was a church service at All Saints Episcopal Church three and-a-half weeks later.

Zdenska Vas

Zdenska Vas (; , ) is a village north of Videm in the Municipality of Dobrepolje in Slovenia. The area is part of the historical region of Lower Carniola. The municipality is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.
History.
Zdenska Vas was first mentioned in written sources in 1256, when the Count of Ortenburg sold the village to the monastery at Stična. During the Second World War, Italian and White Guard forces had a military post at Saint Anthony's Church; this post was used by German and Home Guard troops later in the war. The post was attacked by the Partisans on 29 February and 1 March 1944, during which many houses and outbuildings in the village were destroyed.
Church.
The local church, built on the hillside north of the village, is dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and belongs to the Parish of Dobrepolje–Videm. The church was established in the second half of the 17th century. In the mid-19th century it was painted with frescoes by Štefan Šubic (1820–1884). The church was damaged and burned during bombing in 1944. Among the furnishings, the local people were able to save a statue of Saint Anthony of Padua, the tabernacle, and a pew. Permission to restore the church was not obtained until after Slovenia became independent. The paintings in the church were restored in 1991 by the painter Izidor Mole, assisted by Tine Šporar from Podpeč.

Music transposer

A music transposer is a physical or electronic device for the transposition of musical notes and/or chords from one note/key to another. It simply consists of two identical scales which can be moved in relation to each other to give the required result.
Until 1994 tranposers consisted of sliding three transparencies alongside each other. 
In November 1994 the circular transposer was invented by Terence Tranter, a British resident in Australia.
This device consisted of two circular discs one with a larger diameter. Along the edge of both discs was printed the chromatic musical scale. the smaller disc was pivoted centrally allowing it to rotate in relation to the other, each scale being visible.
By aligning the known Keynote of a scale with the Keynote of the required scale it is possible to read all the notes in relation to each other.

<doc id="31055480" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31055480" title="321 Studios v. Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Inc.">
321 Studios v. Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Inc.

321 Studios v. Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 2d 1085 (N.D. Cal. 2004), is a district court case brought by 321 Studios seeking declaratory judgment from the court that their DVD ripping software, i.e. DVD Copy Plus and DVD X Copy do not violate the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), or, in the alternative, that the DMCA is unconstitutional because Congress exceeded its enumerated powers, these provisions are unconstitutionally vague and/or violate the First Amendment.
The District Court for the Northern District of California rejected 321 Studios' claims for declaratory relief, holding that both DVD Copy Plus and DVD-X Copy violated the DMCA and that the DMCA was not unconstitutional. Simultaneously, the court granted an injunction to enjoin 321 Studios from manufacturing, distributing, or otherwise trafficking in any type of DVD circumvention software.
Background.
Plaintiff.
321 Studios was a private company that marketed and sold software and instructions for copying DVDs. DVD Copy Plus consisted of an electronic guide explaining how to create backup copies of DVDs, two pieces of free, publicly available software, and a CD burning application. This software allowed users to copy portions of DVDs onto CDs regardless of whether they were encoded using Content Scramble System ("CSS"). DVD X Copy created backup copies of DVDs onto a user's computer that could then be burned to a DVD. DVD X Copy used a CSS key to access the data if a DVD was encoded with CDD.
Defendants.
The defendants were mostly made up of members of the Motion Picture Association of America ("MPAA"). As a result of the claim of unconstitutionality, the United States joined the suit as an intervening defendant.
Claims.
The plaintiff filed a complaint including two claims:
1. Claim One is a declaratory judgment that the distribution of DVD Copy Plus and DVD-X COPY do not violate the provisions of the DMCA or, in the alternative, that these provisions of DMCA are invalid because Congress exceeded its enumerated powers, these provisions are unconstitutionally vague, and/or these provisions violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.
2. Claim Two seeks another declaratory judgment that the distribution of DVD Copy Plus and DVD-X COPY do not violate the Copyright Act on the grounds that they have substantial non-infringing uses, that the use of these software constitute fair use, and/or that the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act, if interpreted to bar the distribution of DVD Copy Plus and DVD-X COPY, violate the First Amendment.
The court's analysis in the decision did not reach the Copyright violation issue, but directly rejected 321 Studios's claims and granted the injunction based on the DMCA provisions.
Issues.
The litigation solved mainly two issues. First, whether or not 321 Studios was liable under sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1) of the DMCA. Section 1201(a)(2) of the DMCA prohibits the "manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, or part thereof, that" is primarily designed or produced for purposes of circumventing a technological protection measure that controls access to a copyrighted work. Section 1201(b)(1) prohibits the same for technological protection measures that effectively protects an exclusive right of a copyright owner.
The second issue concerns whether or not the DMCA, as construed by members of the MPAA, is unconstitutionally void. 321 Studios argued that the DMCA is invalid, because (1) the DMCA in this context restricted 321 Studios' free speech protected under the First Amendment, (2) the DMCA impermissibly burden the fair use rights of the end users, and (3) the DMCA exceeded the scope of congressional powers.
Court's Holding.
The court held that both of DVD Copy Plus and DVD-X Copy violated the DMCA and that the DMCA was not unconstitutional. The court enjoined 321 Studios from manufacturing, distributing, or otherwise trafficking in any type of DVD circumvention software.
Court's Rationale.
DMCA Violations.
1201(a)(2) Liability.
The court found that, because 321 Studios' DVD copying software circumvented CSS, a technological protection measure that effectively controls access to the DVDs, because the software had only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent CSS, and because it was marketed for use in circumventing CSS, the court would not grant declaratory relief to 321 Studios on the 1201(a)(2) claim. 321 Studios argued that because the owner of a DVD has the authority of the copyright holder to access the DVD, they have the authority of the copyright owner and so cannot be liable under 1201(a)(2). The court rejected this argument using the reasoning put forth by the Second Circuit in Universal Studios v. Corley, arguing the "basic flaw in this argument is that it misreads subsection § 1201(a)(3)(A). That provision exempts from liability those who would `decrypt' an encrypted DVD with the authority of a copyright owner, not those who would `view' a DVD with the authority of a copyright owner."
321 Studios also argued that if their software was a violation, then all DVD players must necessarily be a violation because they also decrypt CSS. The court rejected this argument as well, stating that the difference between 321 Studios and the manufacturer of a DVD player is that the manufacturer has been given a specific CSS key subject to strict use restrictions.
1201(b)(1) Liability.
The court found that, because 321 Studios' DVD copying software circumvented CSS, a technological protection measure that effectively controls the copying of DVDs, because the software had only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent CSS, and because it was marketed for use in circumventing CSS, the court would not grant declaratory relief to 321 Studios on the 1201(b)(1) claim. 321 argued that CSS does not actually control copying from the DVD, it only controls access. The court dismissed this argument, stating "while 321 is technically correct that CSS controls access to decrypted DVDs, the purpose of this access control is to control copying of those DVDs, since encrypted DVDs cannot be copied unless they are accessed."
321 Studios also argued that their software did not violate 1201(b)(1) because many uses of the software were legitimate uses sanctioned by copyright law, such as accessing public domain DVDs or DVDs without CSS, making a fair use of DVD content, or making a single archival copy. The court dismisses this argument, asserting that the downstream uses of the software are irrelevant in determining whether or not 321 Studios itself was violating 1201(b)(1). The court said that, while there are legitimate uses that some users might engage in, 321 Studios itself was distributing software which had the primary purpose of circumventing CSS.
DMCA Constitutionality.
Impermissible Restriction of Speech.
The court rejected 321 Studios' argument that the DMCA, as enforced in this case, would result in an impermissible restriction of free speech. The court agreed with 321 Studios that computer code qualifies as speech for purposes of first amendment, however, they did not agree that enforcing the DMCA in this case would regulate computer code on the basis of content. The court held that only the functional element of the computer code was barred, and so the DMCA did not suppress the code based on its content. As such, the court applied an intermediate scrutiny standard in evaluating the restriction of speech in this case.
Applying the intermediate scrutiny standard, the court found that Congress enacted the DMCA while carefully balancing the interests of copyright holders and the public. As such, the court held that the DMCA suppressed only as much speech as necessary to the furtherance of the interests of copyright owners and so was not an impermissible restriction of speech.
Impermissible Burdens on Fair Use.
The court rejected 321 Studios' argument that the DMCA unconstitutionally burdens the fair use rights of users of copyrighted materials. The court agreed with 321 Studios that fair use necessarily incorporates first amendment accommodations, but rejected that there is an absolute first amendment protection for fair use of copyrighted works. The court pointed out that fair use is still possible under the DMCA, even if it might be difficult to do so without circumventing CSS. 321 Studios argued that this places an unreasonable financial burden on fair use, an argument that the court said must be tied to the content of the speech, not simply the function. 321 Studios also argued that the DMCA also impairs access to non-copyrighted works protected by CSS. The court responded to this by asserting that a user could copy the access from a non-CSS encrypted DVD or from another non-digital source.
Over-Extension of the Scope of Congressional Powers.
321 Studios further claimed that the DMCA is inevitably an over-extension of Congressional powers because the DMCA is inconsistent with fair use. The court rejected this conclusion using reasoning from the Universal Studios v. Corley case, stating that restricting one technological means of gaining access to or reproducing a work does not foreclose the possibility of making use of the work. 321 Studios asserted that the line of reasoning in previous DMCA cases was overturned by the conclusion in Eldred v. Ashcroft that fair use is constitutionally based. The court responded by emphasizing again that the DMCA does not eliminate fair use, and that fair use does not guarantee users of copyrighted works with using a work in any technological fashion.
Impact.
321 Studios inevitably shut down as a result of this decision and similar lawsuits. While the court's ruling on the constitutionality of the DMCA is consistent with rulings made across the country, many public interest groups have continued to lobby to overturn portions of the DMCA. Some have criticized the courts classification of CSS as an access control for purposes of the DMCA, arguing that "if every act of rendering protected content is an act of accessing the content and the statute prohibits individual circumvention of access controls, then the individual privilege to circumvent rights controls exists only in theory."

Europhenome

Europhenome is a resource for presenting, searching and analysing mouse phenotypes that were revealed by high throughput mouse phenotyping programmes such as EUMODIC.
The EuroPhenome project provides access to raw and annotated mouse phenotyping data generated from primary pipelines such as EMPReSSlim and secondary procedures from specialist centres. Mutants of interest can be identified by searching the gene or the predicted phenotype.
Description.
EuroPhenome is an open source project to develop a software system for capturing, storing, and analysing raw phenotyping data from standard operating procedures contained in EMPReSS.
EuroPhenome is primarily based in the bioinformatics group at MRC Harwell. The development of EuroPhenome is in collaboration with the Helmholtz Zentrum München, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the Clinique de la Souris (France).
Initially, EuroPhenome was developed within the EUMORPHIA (European Union Mouse Research for Public Health and Industrial Applications) programme to capture and store pilot phenotyping data obtained on four background strains (C57BL/6J, C3H/HeBFeJ, BALB/cByJ and 129/SvPas). EUMORPHIA was a large project consisting of 18 research centres in 8 European countries, with the main focus of the project being the development of novel approaches in phenotyping, mutagenesis and informatics to improve the characterisation of mouse models for understanding human molecular physiology and pathology.
The current version of EuroPhenome is capturing data from the EUMODIC project as well as the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Programme, HMGU German Mouse Clinic pipeline, and the CMHD. EUMODIC is undertaking a primary phenotype assessment of up to 500 mouse mutant lines derived from ES cells developed in the EUCOMM project as well as other lines. Lines showing an interesting phenotype will be subject to a more in depth assessment.
EUMODIC is building upon the database of standardised phenotyping protocols, EMPReSS, developed by the EUMORPHIA project. EUMODIC has developed a selection of these screens, called EMPReSSslim, to enable comprehensive, high throughput, primary phenotyping of large numbers of mice.
EuroPhenome annotation of phenovariants.
Phenovariants are annotated using an automated pipeline, which assigns an MP term if the mutant data is statistically different from the baseline data. This data is shown in the Phenomap and the mine for a mutant tool. Please note that a statistically significant result and the subsequent MP annotation does not necessarily mean a true phenovariant. There are other factors that could cause this result that have not been accounted for in the analysis. It is the responsibility of the user to download the data and use their expert knowledge or further analysis to decide whether they agree or not.

Bar Karma

Bar Karma is the first online community-developed network television series. Online users pitch their own ideas for scenes and twists online, using a tool designed by Will Wright called the Storymaker. Some are eventually chosen by the production staff, and are utilized to help create a new episode every week. The main plot revolves around a bar known as "Bar Karma", a bar that resides someplace in between parallel timelines. Up until now, the typical structure of the shows consists of a patron accidentally walking into or being transported to the bar, where they are shown the consequences of their current life actions, and the potential outcomes for their behavior and choices. This, ultimately, leads to a karmic dilemma, and forces the patron to make a life-altering choice.
In the first episode, Doug Jones suddenly walks into the bar after a one-night stand. He is confused, and thinks that he accidentally fell asleep and is dreaming. When he finally realizes that this is some strange form of reality, James (Sanderson) and Dayna (Howarth) explain to him why he is in the bar, and is given the chance to alter his fate, and the course of "Bar Karma."
Plot.
There's a place at the edge of the universe, a venue that's behind time and before space, a watering hole where the tab you run up may never be paid - in this lifetime, at least.
That place is "Bar Karma".
Notoriously lucky billionaire Doug Jones wins "Bar Karma" on a bet. He soon learns that ownership includes more than pouring the perfect cocktail - a lot more. Every happy hour one lost soul wanders through the bar's doors, finding themselves at a karmic crossroads in his or her life. The "Bar Karma" staff guides their patrons using eerie glimpses into the past, present and many possible futures.
What would happen if you could change your fate? That's the question "Bar Karma" sets out to answer. The show may begin with "A guy walks into a bar..." but "Bar Karma" always ends with someone's life being changed...forever.
Characters.
Doug Jones, portrayed by Matthew Humphreys
Cocky Internet mogul Doug Jones never intended to own a bar. But when you're made of luck, you tend to win a few pots at the poker table—and one of them included the deed to "Bar Karma". Now he's responsible for helping his customers make life-changing decisions. Which is funny, considering that Doug hasn't a clue whether he's made the right decisions himself.
James Anon, portrayed by William Sanderson
Grizzled bartender James has been pouring drinks at "Bar Karma" for as long as he can remember. For a man who's over 20,000 years old, that's a long time. James has died more than 500 deaths, returning each time with hazy memories of his past lives—and the wrongs he still needs to right.
Dayna Rollins, portrayed by Cassie Howarth
Dayna was once a patron at the bar, facing her own karmic crossroads. Rather than return to her unhappy life on Earth, Dayna made a bold move; she asked James the bartender for a job. Now as the bar's lone waitress and a member of the Bar Karma team, she helps guide customers through their pasts and futures, while keeping herself rooted firmly in the present.

James Graeme (poet)

James Graeme (1749–1772) was a Scottish poet.
Life.
Graeme was born 15 December 1749, at Carnwath in Lanarkshire, the fourth and youngest son of William Graeme, a farmer of the middle class. As a child he was delicate, and his parents educated him for the ministry. After being taught to read in a dame's school, he was sent to the grammar schools of Carnwath, Libberton, and Lanark.
In 1767 he went to Edinburgh University, where he studied for three years. His friend and biographer, Robert Anderson (1750–1830), says that he excelled in classical learning, and made a special study of metaphysics, besides reading widely in general literature. In 1769 he was presented to a bursary at St. Andrews University, but soon resigned it, and, returning to Edinburgh next year, entered the theological class. In 1771 he became tutor to the sons of Major Martin White of Milton, near Lanark. He died of consumption at Carnwath, 26 July 1772.
Works.
His poems consisted of elegies and miscellaneous pieces. His poetical reputation is due to Anderson, who printed his friend's poems after his death, together with some of his own, in "Poems on Several Occasions", Edinburgh, 1773. They reappeared in Robert Anderson's "Poets of Great Britain", vol. xi., and in Richard Alfred Davenport's "British Poets", vol. lxxi.; a selection is given in "The Works of the British Poets", edited by Thomas Park, vol. v.

Arthur J. Collingsworth

Arthur J. Collingsworth (February 28, 1944 – July 23, 2013) was a retired American United Nations official, international student exchange executive, consultant on international fund raising and real estate investor. He lived in the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Czech Republic and Germany.
Life.
Collingsworth was born on February 28, 1944 in Jackson, Michigan. He grew up and attended public schools in Tecumseh, Michigan where he was a student leader.
At the age of fourteen he wrote a letter to President Juscelino Kubitschek of Brazil that resulted in his appointment as Brazilian Government Trade Bureau Representative to Michigan and Ohio. The media described him as the "world's youngest diplomat" and the United States Information Agency made a film about him called "A Midwestern Boy Writes to the President of Brazil". In recognition of his promotional efforts President Kubitschek invited him to visit Brazil for a month in 1960.
In 1962 he entered the University of Michigan as a Regents Alumni Scholarship recipient and received a B.A. in Political Science in 1967. He was active in a number of organizations and took a year to serve on the staff of his local congressman. He also spent a summer doing research work for the Foreign Affairs Research Division of the House Republican Conference in Washington, D.C., and wrote a syndicated column entitled "Our Man in Washington" for a group of Michigan newspapers.
In the summer of 1965 he spent several months in South Vietnam as a student leader observer on a grant from an American organization. In the summer of 1966 he made his second trip around the world as chairman of a delegation of national college Republican leaders. The group met with a number of senior political and government leaders and prepared a report for selected Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee upon their return. In 1967 Collingsworth established the Niels Hansen Memorial Foundation and has served as its Chairman since then.
In the autumn of 1967 he entered the Georgetown University Graduate School. He held an Earhart Foundation Fellowship and served as a Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). He received his M.A. in Government (international relations) in 1971. While a Fellow at CSIS he helped to author "Trading with Communist Countries: A Reference Manual", which was published by the Center in January 1968. He work for a year on the Presidential campaign staff of Richard Nixon and sthen served on the White House Transition staff.
Collingsworth was named Director of Public Affairs and Development of the YFU Teenage Student Exchange Program of Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1969. YFU was one of the world's two largest student exchange organizations. In 1975 he was named Vice President and held this position until August 1982. During his tenure he raised more than $20 million for the organization and pioneered fund raising in Japan where he generated more than $10 million from government and private sources. He conceived and funded the Japan-U.S. Senate Student Exchange Program that was followed by the Bundestag-Congress Student Exchange Program with Germany and the Finland-U.S. Senate Student Exchange Program. He subsequently served as a Trustee and Consultant to YFU for another twelve years.
In September 1982, Collingsworth joined the staff of the United Nations University (UNU) in Tokyo as their Senior Resource Development Officer. The UNU is a United Nations agency with a mandate for research, training and dissemination of information on areas of interest to the UN. He raised $30 million plus the provision of physical facilities from the Government of Finland for the establishment of the UNU's first research and training center, the World Institute for Development Economics Research (WIDER) in Helsinki, Finland. In April 1985 he was named Director of the United Nations University Office in Europe located and held this post in London until late 1988.
In December 1984, the President of Finland conferred the Order of the White Rose, Knight 1st Class, on Collingsworth. He was the youngest non-Finn to have received this honor. He is also a Commander of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, a member of Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco and of the Metropolitan Club of Washington, DC.
In 1989 he began a consultancy specializing in international fund raising. His clients included The Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) in London, WIDER in Helsinki, Oxford University (Refugee Studies Center), the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, where he assisted in the initiation of their $65 million grant that established the International Youth Foundation, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
During the 1990s Collingsworth and Brian R. Simmons, his British life partner of 38 years, divided their time between their homes in San Francisco and Craignish Castle on the west coast of Scotland. Aside from consulting they acquired, upgraded, and managed apartment projects in San Francisco. Collingsworth also served on the Boards of the World Affairs Council of Northern California for 10 years, the San Francisco Committee on Foreign Relations, and the American Scandinavian Foundation in New York. He also served as the national treasurer of Log Cabin Republicans for three years.
In 1999 Collingsworth conceived and promoted the initiative known as the Millennium Technology Prize as Finland's legacy for serving as President of the European Union. The Prize of 800,000 to one million Euros is given every other year to someone who has made the greatest contribution to a technology that improves the quality of life and sustainable development. It is the world's largest award in the field of technology. The Prize is presented by the President of Finland. In 2004 the President of Finland conferred the Order of the Lion, Commander class, on Collingsworth making him one of the few foreigners to have received Finland's two highest decorations.
The U.S. President appointed him to a four-year term on the National Security Education Board in 2002. Between 1997 and 2009 Collingsworth lectured on European history aboard more than 25 cruises for the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. During this period he divided his time among San Francisco and Prague, Czech Republic, and San Diego, California (2003) and Berlin, Germany starting in 2008.
Collingsworth has had a lifelong interest in Imperial Russia. His Godfather, Tihon Kulikovsky, was the eldest son of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna and nephew of Czar Nicholas II. He visited Olga various times when she was living in exile in Canada in the 1950s. She was a gifted painter (primarily watercolors but also oils) and Collingsworth has assembled one of the largest private collections of her art that has been shown in several exhibitions, including a special exhibition at the residence of the Russian Ambassador in Washington, D.C. In 2006 he accompanied members of the Romanov family to the state reburial of Olga's mother, Empress Marie Feodorovna (Dagmar), in St. Petersburg, Russia. He has lectured extensively on the history of the Romanov Family and Imperial Russia.
Collingsworth had a keen interest in encouraging young people to study abroad. Over the years, Collingsworth and Simmons gave out scholarships to students in many parts of the world. They have stayed in touch with many of these exceptional people and watched them launch impressive careers in their respective countries.
Simmons and Collingsworth traveled extensively. They lived together in many parts of the USA, most recently in the San Diego area, and over the years they maintained homes in Tokyo, London, Scotland, Prague and Berlin.
Arthur J. Collingsworth died in Berlin, Germany on July 23, 2013 from complications of bone marrow cancer.

Keighley RUFC

Keighley RUFC is a Rugby Union club based in Keighley, West Yorkshire. The club currently play in North 1 East, after promotion from Yorkshire 1 in the 2011/12 season.
History.
Keighley R.U.F.C. (or the Keighlians Old Boys R.U.F.C. as it was originally named) was formed by a group of old boys of Keighley Grammar School in 1920. Its name was first changed to Keighlians R.U.F.C. and later to Keighley R.U.F.C.
In the early years matches were played at a variety of venues in and around the town before a more permanent playing area was secured on council land near to the gas works at Thwaites. In addition for many years we had a social club in Lord Street in the town centre.
Our facilities at Thwaites were improved gradually over the years ( surviving a near catastrophic fire in the 1960s) until finally we moved to our present address at Utley in 1986 when Keighley played against Yorkshire to officially open the new ground. Among the Yorkshire team that day was former Keighley Colts player Martin Whitcombe who made a try scoring debut for the county against the club where he learnt to play rugby. Yorkshire went on that year to win the County Championship final at Twickenham.
The club is justly proud of its progress and development and we now have playing facilities and a club house which stand comparison with most.
Many outstanding players and impressive sides have been produced over the years but the pinnacle of the club’s achievements was in the 1947/8 season when it won both the Yorkshire Shield and Yorkshire Cup competitions, beating Sheffield by 17 points to 0 in the Shield final at Otley and Otley by 14 points to 6 in the Cup final at Skipton. It is almost certain that this unprecedented feat will never again be equalled.
We field three senior sides on Saturdays and an under 19’s side on Sundays. In addition we were one of the pioneers of mini rugby in Yorkshire in 1967 and now have a thriving and much admired junior section for all age groups from 7 years to 17 years.
With the formation of leagues in 1987, we began life alongside Wharfedale and Rotherham in league North East One, where we remained until reconstruction of leagues in 2000 placed us in Yorkshire league One. This is generally acknowledged to be one of the most competitive leagues at level seven in the country. After relegation in 2001 we returned to Yorkshire league One in 2003/4 as league Two champions and have remained there since. Following a second place finish in Yorkshire 1's 2011/12 season, Keighley travelled to Alnwick RFC for a play-off against the Durham and Northumberland 1 runners-up. Keighley went on to record an 18-16 Victory gaining them promotion to North East 1.
Keighley RUFC and especially the colts team has produced several players who have gone on to have out standing rugby careers in both Rugby Union & Rugby League.

<doc id="31055761" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31055761" title="Enterprise planning system">
Enterprise planning system

An enterprise planning system covers the methods of planning for the internal and external factors that affect an enterprise.
These factors generally fall under PESTLE. PESTLE refers to political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors. Regularly addressing PESTLE factors falls under operations management. Meanwhile, addressing any event, opportunity or challenge in any one or many factors for the first time will involve project management.
As opposed to enterprise resource planning (ERP), enterprise planning systems have broader coverage. Enterprise planning systems address the resources that are available or "not" available to an enterprise and its ability to produce products or resources and/or provide services. It also considers those factors that will positively or negatively affect the firm's ability to run these actions.
Enterprise planning systems will tend to vary and are flexible. These are due to the periodic and adaptive nature of strategy formation. These will also have tactical aspects. Typically, enterprise planning systems are part of a firm's knowledge base or corporate structure whether it formally identified and structured or simply executed these when the need appeared.
Purposes.
An enterprise planning system will address at least three basic purposes to help the enterprise: 
Survival.
An enterprise will plan for tactical moves for quick reaction to the PESTLE threats that affect its survival. For instance, right after Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant has experienced explosions due to the earthquake and the tsunami that followed, several enterprises (within and outside of Japan) have publicly announced their course of actions to address the emergency.
Competition.
Meanwhile, an enterprise will plan for longer term strategic actions to address its competition or improve its competitiveness. For instance, enterprises will plan for, set budgets, implement and use strategic information systems as “information systems or information technology investments can be a source of competitive advantage”.
Opportunities.
Most significantly, an enterprise will plan for using the PESTLE opportunities that are available to it. The profit and benefit motives justify most enterprise planning systems.
Vulnerabilities.
A fourth noteworthy purpose for enterprise planning systems is preparedness against terrorist attacks. As noted in the US Presidential Directive for Critical infrastructure protection, terrorist groups are likely to attack commercial infrastructure for economic sabotage. Enterprises that are providing products or services that are critical to the economic system of a nation are potential targets of extremists.
Strategic planning.
Two major characteristics of EPSs are (1) variety and (2) flexibility. For instance, technological risks abound as even enterprise software are prone to obsolescence and disruptive innovations. Technology is not stagnant. Thus, variety and flexibility work to the advantage of a strategically adaptive or agile enterprise as PESTLE conditions change.
To illustrate this some more, ERP software prescribes processes to realize its promised benefits. However, compliance to these rigid, prescribed processes is often assumed rather than real. In many cases, the ERP software is accepted but the practices within the enterprise reflect inconsistencies with the prescribed processes of the software. In a sense, variety and flexibility in a standard ERP implementation will still manifest in many ways such as "workarounds, shadow systems, various forms of unintended improvisations, and organizational 'drift'" as the knowledge workers in the enterprise adapt to the realities of daily activities.
With changing real world conditions, at least three components can structure enterprise strategy. These are: 
Strategy via analysis.
Frameworks of analysis usually drive a firm's strategy. These enable the firm to cope with the actions of its competitors, demands of its consumers or clients, nature of its operating environments, effects of government regulations in the places where it does business, or opportunities that are available among other factors. Here, team planning is crucial. One group will normally specialize in one aspect like operations or government regulations. Managing the interrelation of PESTLE factors requires team work in the enterprise planning process.
A sample framework for general analysis is the SWOT analysis. Another is the Balanced Scorecard for performance measurement analysis.
Strategy via geography.
Enterprise strategy can also refer to the mix of structured actions that address the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental factors that affect a business or firm. These structured actions can be local, transnational, global or combination of local, transnational or global. Hence, enterprises can have any of the following geographic strategies in their plans:
Strategy via projects integration.
Moreover, since management actions occur simultaneously in an enterprise, strategic planners can consider operations or project portfolio management (PPM) as crucial elements in an enterprise's strategic planning guide.
For instance, the need to have strategic priorities across many projects in companies with multiple product development projects have made executives borrow principles from investment portfolio management to better manage the distribution of resources compared with the assessed risks for each project.
Thus, PESTLE factors lead to strategy formation that will enable the enterprise to adapt to changing conditions. Meanwhile, the strategies that have been formed from the analytical framework processes of evaluating an enterprise's condition will lead to detailed plans which could be part of a firm's manual of operations or projects portfolio thrusts for funding and execution across the units or geographic coverage of the enterprise.
Planning and budgeting.
Enterprise planning and budgeting go hand-in-hand as the wherewithal to execute plans will determine the success or failure of an enterprise strategy. In another light, expanding or limiting the budget for a particular operations aspect of the enterprise or an ongoing project in favor of another will signal changes to an enterprise's strategy. Hence, planning and budgeting are integral parts of any enterprise planning systems as these impact the strategic directions of the enterprise.
For instance, enterprise projects tend to be mutually dependent with other projects to leverage a firm's engineering, financial and technology resources. A market research project will trigger a research, development and engineering (RD&E) project for a new product. In turn, this RD&E project could trigger a production strategy project to manufacture the new product at the most efficient locations to bring it closer to its target consumers. Hence, cutting the RD&E project budget in half or increasing it twice will have profound effects in the long term direction of an enterprise as this will affect the other units of the firm undertaking projects that are linked to the RD&E project.
Classifications.
Enterprise planning and budgeting can be generally classified into:
Centralized. Headquarters or executive management directs all planning and budgets from the top then downwards in the organization hierarchy. It will closely follow Frederick Winslow Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management.
Devolved. Middle managers set plans effectively steering the enterprise's strategic direction. Executive management takes into account that the enterprise has knowledge workers that are experts in their respective fields. The Management Board approves the proposed strategic direction under certain financial constraints such as expected returns on investment or equity.
Hybrid. Executive management determines and sets the strategic direction of the enterprise based on the inputs of middle managers and the rank and file. In this set up, plans and budgets are negotiated.
Essentially, enterprise plans and budgets can be detailed in a top-down approach, generalized in a bottom-up approach, or combined in a top-down and bottom-up approach.
Group planning.
Enterprise group planning will typically refer to the involvement of the major units of an enterprise such as the finance, marketing, production or technology departments. It can also refer to the involvement of the geographic units of a transnational or global firm. Some enterprises also involve external parties in their group planning where inputs from the crucial parts of the supply chain, cooperation and collaboration, or outsiders-looking-in are part of the firm's strategy.
Enterprise group planning will usually manifest in regular board of directors' or management committee' meetings with varying frequencies such as monthly, quarterly or annually. Traditional meetings have required the physical presences of representatives from the various business units of the enterprise. With improvements in telecommunications, enterprise group planning can be conducted through video conferencing where participants may be dispersed geographically. However, video conferencing still appears to be an inadequate substitute when warm, interpersonal relations are part of the firm's culture.
Yet for fast-paced events like natural disasters or a meltdown of the financial markets that require immediate action from the enterprise, video conferencing might be the only option. Troubleshooting that requires the major resources of the enterprise will also entail enterprise group planning. Here, enterprise planning systems take a tactical form rather than a strategic focus to preserve the stability or ensure the survival of the enterprise.
Transition plan.
Enterprise transition plans will generally refer to change management-related actions in the case of mergers or in the implementation of an enterprise-wide project. The transition plan will cover the elimination of redundant functions in the case of a merger or the incorporation of new processes into business operations in the case of a technology project.
Planning software.
Enterprise planning software will have varied or depth of coverage but will not essentially refer to enterprise resource planning software. This will include planning-centric software and the tools to support strategic planning for and across the enterprise, such as:

Autoprotolysis

In autoprotolysis a proton is transferred between two identical molecules, one of which acts as a Brønsted acid, releasing a proton which is accepted by the other molecule acting as a Brønsted base. For example water undergoes autoprotolysis in the self-ionization of water reaction.
Any solvent that contains both acidic hydrogen and lone pairs of electrons to accept H+ can undergo autoprotolysis.
For example, Ammonia in its purest form may undergo autoprotolysis:

<doc id="31055908" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31055908" title="Sarkhej Roza">
Sarkhej Roza

Sarkhej Roza is a mosque located in the village of Makraba, 7 km south-west of Ahmedabad in Gujarat state, India. The mosque is known as "Ahmedabad's Acropolis", due to 20th century architect Le Corbusier's famous comparison of this mosque's design to the Acropolis of Athens.
Although there are many "rozas" across Gujarat, the Sarkhej Roza is the most revered. Sarkhej was once a prominent centre of Sufi culture in the country, where influential Sufi saint Ganj Baksh lived. It was on the saint's suggestion that Sultan Ahmed Shah set up his capital on the banks of the Sabarmati, a few miles away from Sarkhej.
Overview of all the Monuments.
The Sarkhej Roza complex has been interpreted as being composed of both 'jism'(body) and 'ruh'(spirit), giving it the qualities of a human being. The intricate stone carvings and stark beauty of the complex reflect the beauty of the soul of the roza's patron-saint Ganj Baksh. The credit for roza's architecture goes to Azam and Mu'azzam; two Persian(Greater khorasan) brothers. 
The complex was originally spread over 72 acres, surrounded by elaborate gardens on all sidea. Over time, human settlements came around it, eating into gardens and reducing the area to 34 acres.
The arrangement of the tombs, palaces and the mosques around the large tank gives a visitor the sense of being in the presence of a formless, timeless entity. Like many monuments built during that period, the Sarkhej Roza fused both Muslim and Hindu principles of architecture. While the ringed domes, the profusion of pillars and brackets follow the Islamic genre, much of the ornamentation and motifs have Hindu designs. Most of the buildings don't have arches and depend on pierced stone trellises for stability. In its architecture, Sarkhej Roza is an example of the early Islamic architectural culture of the region, which fused Islamic stylistic influences from Persia with indigenous Hindu and Jain features to form a composite “Indo-Saracenic” architectural style. 
Although Sultan Qutubuddin Ahmed Shah II completed the roza between 1451 and 1458, it was the next sultan, Mahmud Begada, who gave the complex its present grandeur. He expanded it by building the pleasure palaces, gave finishing touches to the tank and added his own tomb just across the courtyard from the saint's. The mosque, with its courtyard, creates a religious milieu; the royal connection is made through the tombs and palaces; the great tank, platforms and pavilions were used by the common man.

Nintendo 3DS system software

Nintendo 3DS system software is a set of updatable firmware versions and software frontend on the Nintendo 3DS video game console. Updates, which are downloaded via the system's Internet connection allow Nintendo to add and remove features and software. All updates also include all changes from previous updates.
The current version of the system software, 7.2.0-17, was made available on May 13, 2014.
Home Menu.
The Home Menu is a graphical shell similar to the Nintendo DSi Menu and Wii U Menu for Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS systems. It is used to launch software stored on Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS Game Cards, applications installed on a SD card and DSiWare titles installed in the system's internal memory. Application icons are set in a grid navigable with the touchscreen or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The amount of icons per column can also be changed, from 1 icon up to 6. The menu can display up to 120 application tiles. On the upper screen, a special 3D animated logo is displayed for each individual app, as well as system information such as wireless signal strength, date and time, and battery life, while on the bottom screen, application icons are displayed. It is also possible to change the screen's brightness while in the menu. Using the Home button, users can suspend the current software that is running and bring up the Home Menu, allowing the user to launch certain multitasking applications, such as the Internet Browser and Miiverse.
Similarly to the Nintendo DSi, the menu has upgradeable firmware. Game cards can also be hot-swapped while in the menu. The power button prompts the user to either put the console into sleep mode, or shut it down.
On April 25, 2012, a system update brought the introduction of a folder system. Up to 60 folders can be created. Applications can be dragged on top of a folder in order to move it, and from then on, more apps can be added to the folder using the same procedure, up to 60 apps per folder. A title for the folder is automatically created in order of creation (from "1" to "60"), but the name can also be edited by the user. Only the first character of the title will be displayed on the folder's icon. When apps inside folders receive StreetPass or SpotPass notifications, a notification icon will appear on top of the folder
On June 20, 2013, a system update brought the introduction of the "Save Data Backup" feature. This feature allows the user to back up save data from downloadable Nintendo 3DS software and most Virtual Console games. Creating a backup of save data allows users to delete software from the SD card without losing save data. The backup created will then be automatically restored when the user re-downloads software from the Nintendo eShop. A total of 30 save data backups can be stored at a time. It is not possible to back up save data from retail versions of Nintendo 3DS software, DSiWare, and Game Boy Advance software.
Nintendo 3DS Camera.
Nintendo 3DS Camera is a built-in photo and video recorder with an integrated media gallery and photo editing functionality. The app uses the system's two front facing cameras to take 3D photos, and the user-facing camera to take regular 2D photos. All photographs are taken at a resolution of 640 x 480 px (VGA), or 0.3 megapixels. In addition to manual recording controls, timers can also be set to take a photo 3 or 10 seconds after pressing the "Take" button, or by means of voice commands such as saying "OK!" when wishing to take a photo.
There are various options and filters available when taking photos or recording video. In addition to the "Normal" mode, there is a "Low-Light" option, which is useful when taking photos and recording video in dark lighting conditions. Other options include manual controls such as the color type (normal, black and white, sepia, negative or solarize), sharpness, contrast and brightness. Real-time photo filters are also available including "Sparkle", which adds moving stars to the photo, "Dream", which adds a dream-like bright light to the photo, "Pinhole", which lightens the center of the screen and darkens the edges and "Mystery", which adds a random finish to the photo. There is also a special mode called "Merge", which takes a photo of the user facing the inner camera and merges the photo from someone facing the outer cameras.
On December 7, 2011, a system update added the ability to record 3D video along three special recording options. "Interval Shot" allows sequences of images to be recorded in short-timed intervals to create time-lapse photography; "Frame Pick" edits still images together to create stop motion animation; and "Montage" let's the user pause and resume recording seamlessly. However, all recording modes only allow a single video to be up to 10 minutes long.
Nintendo 3DS Sound.
Nintendo 3DS Sound is a built-in music player and sound recorder. Supported audio codecs include MP3 audio (with .mp3 filename extensions) and AAC audio (with .mp4, .m4a, and .3gp filename extensions). Audio files can be played from an SD card, with visualizations displayed on the upper screen. Music can be played while the console is in Sleep Mode, using the system's headphone jack. When using headphones with an included mic and button, the button can toggle play/pause and skip to the next and previous track. A set of sound manipulation options are available, as well as several audio filters. Ten-second voice recordings can be also be recorded, edited with audio filters, and manipulated through modulation and playback speed. Users may save and modify up to 18 of these in the console's memory and up to 180 on an SD card. These can then be used throughout other applications such as Swapnote.
There is a StreetPass function built-into the app. When the user StreetPass's someone who also has StreetPass enabled, both users exchange song data such as the song's name, artist, album, release year, and how many times it has been played. There is also a compatibility chart between the users involved. Depending the amount of matching songs from both users a score will be displayed, ranging from 0% to 100%, with the latter being the most compatible.
Pre-installed Applications.
Multitasking applications.
The Nintendo 3DS is capable of suspending an application and run one of six multitasking applications. Once a game or application is running, the user can press the Home button to suspend it and temporarily open the Home Menu. It is then possible to open another specially designed multitasking application built into the system without closing the currently suspended software. Attempting to open a game or application while another is already running will result in a warning prompt. These multitasking applications include: 
Firmware.
The Nintendo 3DS firmware can run in four different modes. NATIVE_FIRM is the native running firmware for Nintendo 3DS software (including the Home Menu). SAFE_MODE_FIRM is used for safe mode applications, such as the System Settings and System Updater. TWL_FIRM is the Nintendo DSi's native firmware and it is used for Nintendo DS/DSi backward compatibility. Finally, AGB_FIRM is the Game Boy Advance's native firmware and it is used to run Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games.
Nomenclature.
Note that the nomenclature of a firmware version, as it's shown on the 3DS System Settings, is divided in three parts: the first 3 digits represent the firmware version without eShop features (which is the one stored on retail catridges); the number after the dash represents improvements related to the eShop and can only be obtained via online update; and finally the letter at the end represents the region of the console, being the Americas (U), Europe and Australia (E), Japan (J), South Korea (K) and Taiwan (T) the five regions with exclusive firmwares for each one.
System Update releases.
Version 6.
The ability to update within StreetPass Mii Plaza and purchase paid content is only available to users in regions where the full version of the Nintendo eShop is available.

__NOTOC__
The SPCA 90 was a civil transport aircraft built in France in the early 1930s. It was a high-wing monoplane of conventional layout with a thick-sectioned, cantilever wing. The cabin was fully enclosed, and was large enough that the aircraft could be used as an air ambulance to carry two stretchers plus attendants. The fixed undercarriage consisted of divided main units and a tailskid. Only a single example was built (registration "F-AKFJ"), which saw service in Morocco.
In 1935, SPCA built an airliner version of the same design, designated 91T. The cargo area was fitted out as a passenger cabin with seats for eight passengers, a baggage compartment, and a lavatory. This was to be SPCA's last aircraft.

Agnes Milowka

Agnes Milowka (23 December 1981 – 27 February 2011) was an Australian technical diver, underwater photographer, author, and cave explorer.
She gained international recognition for penetrating deeper than previous explorers into cave systems across Australia and Florida, and as a public speaker and author on the subjects of diving and maritime archaeology. She died aged 29 while diving in a confined space.
Early life and schooling.
Born in Częstochowa, Poland, Milowka moved to Melbourne at an early age with her parents, attending Caulfield Grammar School from 1994 to 1999. At the school, she was a house captain, champion school rower and was a finalist in the statewide VCE achiever award. She received her graduate degrees in Maritime Archaeology from Flinders University (2007), Bachelor of Business, Marketing and Event Management from Victoria University (2008), Bachelor of Arts, History and Australian Studies from University of Melbourne (2005), where she was a president of the Melbourne University Underwater Club (2003–2005). She participated as the researcher and diver in a series of qualitative underwater archeology, fieldwork and research projects.
Diving.
In the effort coordinated by Victorian Speleological Association in 2009, she and James Arundale explored Elk River streamway cave system by an additional , which has potential to become the longest continuous stream passage in Victoria, Australia. In a 2009 expedition near Cocklebiddy, she reached the midpoint of Craig Challen’s 2008 line giving her the record for the longest cave dive in Australia for a female. She worked as an underwater grip for a film Discovery Channel Japan "Water's Journey" TV Asahi & Karst Productions in 2008.She was part of the National Geographic Nova TV Special expedition to Blue Holes of the Bahamas, December 2008, as an underwater grip, followed by the expedition to look for similar sinkholes in Queensland, Australia in October 2009.
Milowka was a photographic assistant on the "National Geographic Magazine" expedition to Bahamas Caves, November–December 2009, resulting in a few of her photos being published by the National Geographic website. Her underwater photography has been included in multimedia library of the popular website creation software WebEasy Professional (since 2007), distributed by Avanquest Software.
In 2010, when living in Florida, she laid over of line across a number of cave systems, the most significant of which was Mission Spring. In August 2010, together with James Toland, she made the connection between Peacock Springs and Baptizing Spring, Florida adding over of passage. She was the presenter and editor for TV series "Agnes Milowka Project" (2010) featuring underwater cave footage shot by Wes Skiles, Karst Productions.
Agnes Milowka was a speaker at a number of diving related conferences (OZTek 2009, EuroTek 2010). She acted as a stunt double for two female characters on the James Cameron-produced feature film "Sanctum" (2011) and worked during the production as cave dive instructor to the actors. In 2011 she was nominated as Dive Rite Ambassador. One of her last jobs was as a diving supervisor on "BIRTH", a short film for the TRIMÄPEE fashion label. The movie has been dedicated in her name.
Death.
In February 2011, she ran out of air and died after parting company to explore a tight restriction, which necessitated going solo, in the Tank Cave near Tantanoola in the south east of South Australia. In recognition of Milowka's achievements and legacy, The Agnes Milowka Memorial Environmental Science Award has been established by Mummu Media for underprivileged schools in the area of science, marine studies or exploration. In May 2011 Agnes Milowka posthumously received the Exploration Award, in recognition of the outstanding and dedicated service to the National Speleological Society Cave Diving Section, USA. A number of geologic features have been named in memory and her original exploration work in Australia: "Ag's Dreamtime Passage" in the underwater Olwolgin Cave on Nullarbor Plain, "Agnes Chamber" in Davis Cave System, Bats Ridge, Victoria and "Milowka Canal" in Elk River Cave, Victoria.
Author.

Cyrtandra cyaneoides

Cyrtandra cyaneoides is a rare species of flowering plant in the African violet family known by the common name mapele. It is endemic to Kauai in Hawaii, where it is known from eleven populations containing a total of under 800 individual plants. Several of these were discovered between 2003 and 2008. It is a shrub growing 1 to 1.3 meters tall and bearing white flowers. It was federally listed as an endangered species in 1996.
The plant grows in wet forest habitat, sometimes on cliffs or next to streams. It grows alongside other native plants such as akolea ("Boehmeria grandis"), hoio ("Diplazium sandwichianum"), ʻieʻie ("Freycinetia arborea"), ape ape ("Gunnera kauaiensis"), and several other "Cyrtandra" species. The understory also contains many ferns and bryophytes such as mosses and liverworts. Many of the trees host epiphytes. The habitat is also invaded by non-native plants such as Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta"), kahili ginger ("Hedychium gardnerianum"), and Australian tree fern ("Sphaeropteris cooperi"); these weeds compete with native flora for resources.
The habitat is also degraded by rats, which eat the seeds of mapele.

South African Class 8B 4-8-0

The South African Class 8B 4-8-0 of 1903 is a South African steam locomotive from the pre-Union era in the Transvaal.
In 1903, soon after its establishment, the Central South African Railways placed thirty Class 8-L2 4-8-0 Mastodon type steam locomotives in service. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and reclassified to Class 8B.
Manufacturers.
Upon the establishment of the Central South African Railways (CSAR) in July 1902, soon after the end of the Second Freedom War, Chief Locomotive Superintendent P.A. Hyde became the custodian of a mixed bag of locomotives inherited from the Imperial Military Railways (IMR). These included locomotives that originated with the Selati Railway, the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NZASM), the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway (PPR) and the Oranje-Vrijstaat Gouwerment-Spoorwegen (OVGS).
The comparatively small number of serviceable locomotives that were immediately available for service, compounded by the poor condition of many of the original NZASM, PPR, Selati and OVGS locomotives as well as an expected post-war increase in traffic, led to an order for thirty Cape 8th Class steam locomotives from Neilson, Reid and Company.
They were built to the specifications of the 8th Class Mastodon type designed by H.M. Beatty, the Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) from 1896 to 1910, and were the first locomotives to be ordered under the CSAR administration. Since they differed from the Class 8-L1 that was inherited from the IMR, being equipped with Drummond tubes, these locomotives were designated CSAR Class 8-L2.
While they were being built, Neilson, Reid amalgamated with Dübs and Company and Sharp, Stewart and Company to form the North British Locomotive Company (NBL). As a result, the first ten of these locomotives, numbered in the range from 441 to 450, were delivered as built by Neilson, Reid while the other twenty, numbered in the range from 451 to 470, were delivered as built by NBL, although all the NBL locomotives were also built at the Hyde Park shops of the former Neilson, Reid.
Class 8 sub-classes.
The Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, in terms of the South Africa Act. One of the clauses in the Act required that the three Colonial Government railways, the Cape Government Railways, the Natal Government Railways and the CSAR, also be united under one single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. While the South African Railways (SAR) came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways required careful planning and was only implemented with from 1 January 1912.
In 1912 these locomotives were renumbered in the range from 1132 to 1161 and reclassified to on the SAR.
These locomotives, together with the CSAR’s Classes 8-L1 and 8-L3 Mastodon type locomotives and all the CGR’s 8th Class Consolidations and Mastodons, were grouped into ten different sub-classes by the SAR. The locomotives became SAR Classes 8 and 8A to 8F and the locomotives became Classes 8X to 8Z.
Modifications.
Drummond tubes.
When Hyde placed the order for these locomotives, he specified fireboxes equipped with Drummond water tubes. This involved the installation of cross-water tubes into the firebox, as featured on the London and South Western Railway’s T9 Class and L11 Class, in an attempt to increase the heat surface area of the water, albeit at the cost of increased boiler complexity.
On the unmodified Class 8-L2 locomotives visible exterior evidence of the presence of Drummond tubes was two offset rectangular covers attached to the sides of the firebox just ahead of the cab.
The CGR had also experimented with Drummond tubes by modifying its Class 6 number 286 and had found that the benefit in improved performance was minimal while the tubes were inclined to leak and were difficult to maintain. Like the CGR, the CSAR soon learned that the increase in steaming capacity was not sufficient to warrant the initial cost and increased maintenance involved. In the SAR era the tubes were gradually removed as the boilers required repairs, but the locomotives retained their Class 8B designation.
Superheating.
During A.G. Watson’s term as the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, many of the Class 8 to Class 8F locomotives were equipped with superheated boilers, larger bore cylinders and either inside or outside admission piston valves.
The outside admission valve locomotives had their cylinder bore increased from to and retained their existing SAR classifications, while the inside admission valve locomotives had their cylinder bore increased to and were reclassified, with a "W" suffix added to their existing SAR classifications.
Of the Class 8B locomotives, nine were equipped with superheating, bore cylinders and outside admission piston valves, while retaining their Class 8B classification.
Six locomotives were equipped with superheating, bore cylinders and inside admission piston valves and were reclassified to Class 8BW.
The Class 8B and 8BW builders, works numbers, renumbering and superheating modifications are shown in the table.
Service.
In SAR service, the Class 8 family of locomotives served on every system in the country and in the 1920s became the mainstay of motive power on many branchlines. Their final days were spent in shunting service and by 1972 they were all withdrawn from service.
Modifications illustrated.
The main picture is a scan of a circa 1935 post card showing a SAR Class 8B, ex CSAR Class 8-L2, banking at the Waterval Boven tunnel circa 1912. The pictures below illustrate locomotives with and without Drummond tubes.

Cyrtandra dentata

Cyrtandra dentata is a rare species of flowering plant in the African violet family known by the common names mountain cyrtandra and sharp-toothed cyrtandra. It is endemic to Oahu in Hawaii, where the most recent count estimates 1640 plants occurring in the Waianae Mountains and Koʻolau Mountains. It is a shrub which can reach 5 meters tall and bears white flowers. It was federally listed as an endangered species in 1996. Like other Hawaiian "Cyrtandra" it is called ha`iwale.
One threat to the species is habitat degradation caused by feral pigs. Some individuals of this species are protected from pig damage by fences put up by the US Army. These enclosures also protect the plant from rats. The plant grows in moist forest that becomes dry in the dry season and is prone to fire, more so when there are military exercises in the area, and the plant does not tolerate fire. There is also an invasion by non-native plants such as Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta"), thimbleberry ("Rubus rosifolius"), and Christmas berry ("Schinus terebinthifolius").
The US Army is collecting and storing seeds of this species.

The Game (play)

The Game is a play by Harold Brighouse, first published in 1920 as one of "Three Lancashire Plays", the other two plays being The Northerners and Zack.
The play is centred around a fictional football team, Blackton Rovers, their star player Jack Metherell and the family of club owner Austin Whitworth. Themes include: class divisions, the immoral effects of rich idleness, the moral value of having to work and social trends in the society of that day.
In 1920 the play was adapted into a film "The Winning Goal" directed by G.B. Samuelson. Professional footballer Jack Cock appeared as himself in the film.
It was revived by Northern Broadsides in 2010 after a period of near oblivion. Barrie Rutter, the company's artistic director, failed to find a copy of the script in Britain. He finally found one in a Canadian university library. It is now available from Samuel French Ltd..

"Ten-year-old David is a happy, ordinary boy, untroubled except for occasional strange dreams about a mysterious city - until he befriends Sophie, who is unlike anybody he has met before: she has six toes. But in the ultra-religious village of Waknut, all abnormality is abhorred as an offense against God, and he must keep her secret to himself. When he learns that he, too, is 'deviant', he realises that differences can be very dangerous indeed..."

Verdun pri Uršnih Selih (; ) is a small settlement in the Municipality of Dolenjske Toplice in Slovenia. It lies west of Uršna Sela in the historical region of Lower Carniola. The municipality is included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. 
Name.
The name of the settlement was changed from "Verdun" to "Verdun pri Uršnih selih" (literally, 'Verdun near Uršna Sela') in 1953. The name "Verdun" is derived from the Romance word "*(g)uardōne(m)", based on the Germanic word "*wardō" 'guard'. Although this place name can be understood in a military sense, it is likely that it referred instead to a place where herdsmen guarded their animals.

Henry Corbould

Henry Corbould (1787–1844) was an English artist.
Life.
The third son of Richard Corbould, he was born in London. He studied painting with his father, and was at an early age admitted as a student of the Royal Academy, under Fuseli, where he gained the silver medal for a study from the life. While at the Academy he made the friendship of Flaxman, Stothard, West, Chantrey, and Westmacott. He several times sat as a model to West in whose picture of 'Christ Rejected' his head was painted for that of St. John; as also in that of 'Christ Healing the Sick in the Temple,' in the National Gallery. In 1808 he exhibited a painting of 'Coriolanus'; in the following year 'The Parting of Hector and Andromache,' and 'Thetis comforting Achilles,' &c.; but his name has been comparatively little before the public except as a designer for books, his time having been almost entirely occupied in making drawings from ancient marbles in the possession of various English noblemen. Those of the Woburn Abbey Marbles, made for the Duke of Bedford, were engraved, but only circulated among a few of his Grace's private friends. This was also the case with those executed for the Earl of Egremont. 
The collection of "Ancient Marbles" in the British Museum, on which he was engaged for about thirty years, was in course of publication at the time of his death. He was also occasionally employed in making drawings for the Dilettanti and Antiquarian Societies, of which he was a member. He was devotedly attached to art, and was surpassed by few in professional knowledge; no painter of his time was more thoroughly acquainted with drawing; and his copies from the antique may be referred to as models of accuracy and truth. Nor was he by any means without fancy and invention: some of his book illustrations are among the most graceful and effective productions of the age; and few designers ever more completely entered into the spirit of the author. He died at Robertsbridge, in 1844, of an attack of apoplexy, supposed to have been brought on by exposure to cold.

GWAS Central

GWAS Central (previously HGBASE, HGVbase and HGVbaseG2P) is a publicly available database of summary-level findings from genetic association studies in humans, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
It is funded through the GEN2PHEN project by the European Union under their Seventh Framework Programme.
Scope.
GWAS Central contains the most comprehensive collection of summary-level p-value GWAS data. The web resource employs powerful graphical and text based data presentation methods for discovery of and simultaneous visualisation and co-examination of many studies, at genome-wide and region-specific levels. Studies of interest can now be identified using chromosomal regions/genes and markers; there is also the facility for researchers to view their own data alongside selected studies.
Current content includes ‘top’ p-values from collections; supplementary data; direct researcher submissions; and publicly available data. Consequently, the database now hosts >21 million p-values and 708 studies (vs 3,948 p-values and 798 studies in the NHGRI GWAS catalog), representing ~5% of all such data yet produced. GWAS Central makes parts of its data freely available for download by the research community. However, only parts of the data may be downloaded freely, the whole database content can be accessed as part of a collaboration.
History.
The Human Genome Bi-Allelic SEquence (HGBASE) database was the first version of what is now GWAS Central. It was first released in August 1998, focusing on providing a centralized collection of known human single nucleotide polymorphisms and other simple DNA variants. It was the first publicly available SNP database. The project was expanded over the next year by a consortium including the Karolinska Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Corporate support was provided by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. The version released in November 2001 was renamed the Human Genome Variation database (HGVbase), as this was a better reflection of the scope of the database and its emphasis on collection from many different laboratories. In addition this also highlighted its new role as a central repository for data collection efforts in collaboration with the Human Genome Variation Society.
HGVbase was scaled back in 2004 to simply provide an alternative representation of the full marker list from dbSNP, but development continued on its successor: the Human Genome Variation Genotype-to-Phenotype database (HGVbaseG2P), in many ways the natural evolution of HGVbase into a central database for summary-level genetic association data. The work was originally funded by GlaxoSmithKline, the University of Leicester, and the European Community's Sixth Framework Programme ('INFOBIOMED' Network of Excellence), but the GEN2PHEN project became the main source of funds in 2008. Early work in the project involved devising a powerful way of modeling phenotype and genotype- phenotype data, which itself was adopted and adapted to become the global standard Phenotype And Genotype Experiment Object model. In 2008 HGVbaseG2P went live and extended the project's content and scope by adding a far broader and more comprehensive range of markers (i.e., SNPs, structural variants, and STSs), along with association data from many genetic association studies.
In February 2010, the project was once again renamed to GWAS Central, to reflect the growing focus on genome-wide association studies. GWAS Central is a core component of the GEN2PHEN project and intends to provide an operational model, plus an open-source software package, so others can create similar databases across the world. These will be hosted by institutes, consortia, and even individual laboratories; providing those groups a toolkit for publicising and publishing their genetic association findings on the web and examine their data alongside others data from similar valuable resources.

Comcast Corp. v. FCC

Comcast Corp. v. FCC, 600 F.3d 642, is a 2010 United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia case holding that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not have ancillary jurisdiction over Comcast's Internet service under the language of the Communications Act of 1934. In so holding, the Court vacated a 2008 order issued by the FCC that asserted jurisdiction over Comcast's network management policies and censured Comcast from interfering with its subscribers' use of peer-to-peer software.
On August 1, 2012, Comcast sued the FCC again regarding an order to distribute Tennis Channel equally with Golf Channel and Versus (Comcast Cable v. FCC & USA, No. 12-1337 (D.C. Cir.)).
Background.
In 2007, several subscribers of Comcast high-speed Internet discovered that Comcast was interfering with their use of peer-to-peer networking applications. Challenging Comcast's interference, Free Press and Public Knowledge—two non-profit advocacy organizations—filed a complaint with the FCC. The complaint stated that Comcast's actions violated the FCC Internet Policy Statement, particularly violating the statement's principle that “consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice... to run applications and use services of their choice.” Comcast defended its interference with consumers' peer-to-peer programs as necessary to manage scarce network capacity.
Following this complaint, the FCC issued an order censuring Comcast from interfering with subscribers' use of peer-to-peer software—the FCC's second attempt to enforce its network neutrality policy with the first being the Madison River investigation. The order began with the FCC stating it had jurisdiction over Comcast's network management practices under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 154). Specifically, the Communications Act of 1934 granted the FCC the power to "perform any and all acts, make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders, not inconsistent with Act, as may be necessary in the execution of its functions." Next, the FCC ruled that Comcast impeded consumers' ability to access content and use applications of their choice. Additionally, because other options were available for Comcast to manage their network policy without discriminating against peer-to-peer programs, the FCC found that Comcast's method of bandwidth management breached federal policy.
Comcast complied with the order and appealed.
Opinion of the Court.
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the FCC failed to justify its exercise of ancillary authority to regulate Internet service providers' network management practices. For an issue to fall within an agency's authority, the agency need only have ancillary authority—a sufficient statutory support requesting the agency at least take action in the first instance of the issue. Here, the Court did not find a sufficient statutory basis under the Communications Act of 1934 for the FCC's mandate to regulate the behavior of Internet service providers.
The Court relied on a two-part test for ancillary authority, laid out in "Am. Library Ass'n v. FCC": A commission may exercise ancillary authority only if “(1) the Commission's general jurisdictional granted under Title I the Communications Act covers the regulated subject and (2) the regulations are reasonably ancillary to the Commission's effective performance of its statutorily mandated responsibilities.”
Although Comcast conceded that the FCC satisfied the first prong, the court ruled that the FCC failed to satisfy the second prong. The FCC failed to show that its action of barring Comcast from interfering with its customer's peer-to-peer use was reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of its statutorily-mandated authority. Instead, the FCC relied on a Congressional statement of policy and various provisions of the Communications Act—neither of which the Court found created “statutorily mandated responsibilities.” Additionally, by accepting the FCC's argument, the court believed it would “virtually free the Commission from its congressional tether,” thereby providing the FCC an almost unbounded limit to impose regulations on Internet service providers.
Significance of the decision.
The FCC Order was the Commission's first attempt to impose rules requiring network neutrality among ISPs. But in a unanimous decision, the Court found that the FCC lacked the power to enforce these rules. However, the D.C. Circuit hinted that the court would accept separate jurisdictional arguments under other titles of the communications act. Not only does this affect the administrability of the FCC's current network neutrality principles, but it could also affect a wide variety of broadband issues, such as ensuring ISPs do not block websites like Hulu or YouTube or enforcing ISP's advertised broadband speeds.
Further, the court's decision prompted the FCC to establish new rules regarding internet regulations. Because of the ruling in this case, these rules justify themselves in new ways, namely claiming direct authority through section 706 of the Communications Act, as well as ancillary authority through Title II and VI of the Act. While these justifications avoid the direct complaints raised in this case, it is not clear whether they would hold up on appeal.
Parties' response to judgment.
Comcast's reaction.
Comcast issued the following statement:
The FCC's reaction.
The FCC released the following statement regarding the Comcast v. FCC decision:
The FCC's new net neutrality rules.
In December 2010, FCC approved new net neutrality rules. While these rules did not reclassify a broadband service as a communications service under the Title II regulation, it would forbid cable and DSL Internet service providers from blocking or slowing online service. It would also prohibit mobile carriers from blocking VoIP applications such as Skype and blocking websites in their entirely, while restrictions are fewer than those on cable and DSL.
In January 2011, Verizon filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which was the same court that heard Comcast Corp. v. FCC, to overturn this new rule, although the new rules had not yet been in effect. Verizon brought this lawsuit because they were concerned by the FCC's assertion of broad authority for sweeping new regulation of broadband networks and the internet itself, which Verizon believed was well beyond any authority provided by Congress to the FCC.
A few days after the filing by Verizon, MetroPCS, which had already been accused of violating the new rules, also asked the same court to hear the challenge against the new rules. However, in March, 2013, five days after the FCC approved MetroPCS's pending merger with T-Mobile, MetroPCS announced it was dropping its suit, leaving Verizon the sole challenger of the rules.
The court has not yet rendered a decision.

Mathew T. Thomas

Mathew T Thomas (born 27 September 1961) is an Indian politician who is currently the State President and Legislature Party Leader of the Janata Dal (Secular) He was the Minister of Transport for Kerala from May 2006 to August 2009 in the LDF ministry led by V.S. Achuthanandan.
Early life.
He was born in Tiruvalla as the son of Rev. T. Thomas, a priest of the Mar Thoma Church. He completed his B.Sc. degree from the Mar Thoma College, Tiruvalla, and also has an LL.B. He was motivated by the imposition of Emergency in 1977 to enter politics and joined the Kerala Vidyathi Janata(KVJ), the state youth wing of the erstwhile Janata Party. He served in various positions, beginning as the KVJ Unit Secretary in Marthoma College, Thiruvalla; then as Taluk Secretary, Thiruvalla, District President, Alappuzha, State Secretary, and as State President(1985-88.)
Political career.
He has been elected thrice as a Member of the Kerala Legislature, in 1987, 2006 and 2011. In the 2011 elections, he polled 63289 votes, winning by a margin of 10767 votes, over his nearest rival, Victor T. Thomas of the Kerala Congress (M).
Accomplishments in office.
As the Minister of Transport, Mr. Thomas bought the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) out of great financial crisis with a series of reforms. He did a study involving management consultants from Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation and identified areas where KSRTC could generate revenue and reduce cost. The major steps taken were transforming the bus depots into revenue generating shopping malls. As KSRTC owned the key location in every town this could generate income for KSRTC in the form of rent. The corporation is planning to construct as many as 30 modern commercial complex-cum-bus terminals in different parts of the state which are expected to create a monthly revenue of Rs. 100 crores. His hometown Tiruvalla is one of the first towns to get such a shopping mall. The commercial complex in Thiruvalla is a 10-storey structure with state-of-the-art facilities. The corporation was planning to implement the project on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis.
Another progressive step was to improve fuel efficiency and reduce accidents. This was achieved through incentivising the drivers with better economy and fewer accident rates. The corporation had submitted a proposal to the State Government for switching over to CNG as fuel. The proposal, worth Rs 280 crore, envisages using CNG in 1,500 buses in the first phase along with another proposal for acquiring electronic buses, and both the proposals would be presented before the 13th Finance Commission. The Corporation could register an annual profit of Rs 43 crore on converting to CNG and Rs 288 crore on using LNG. The KSRTC has been selected for the Kerala State Energy Conservation Awards 2009.
He revived the KSRTC bus body building units and ditched the decision to buy chassis from private companies, which saved the corporation a huge amount. This scheme also helped to move more contracted employees on to a permanent basis. He managed to review the pay scale after ten years and improve the working condition for the employees and made the KSRTC more employee friendly. He hence managed to avoid the strikes which had previously incurred heavy losses to the corporation every year.
Mr. Thomas was instrumental in getting more funding for the KSRTC. Under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission project 80 low floor air-conditioned Volvo buses were launced in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. Thiruvanathapuram also received another 50 air buses under the Ananthapuri Fast Buses Scheme. During his tenure, the monthly earnings of the corporation jumped Rs.68 crore to Rs.100 crore. The distance covered by the KSRTC buses increased from over 11 lakh to 13 lakh kilometers. KSRTC also created 9,135 vacancies during his term.
Mr. Thomas achieved all this with the credit of the only transport Minister to reduce the fares of KSRTC. He resigned as a result of a split in his party and sacrificed his ministership to his fellow party MLA Mr. Jose Thettayil.

Trackday trophy

The Trackday Trophy was created by MotorSport Vision to specifically cater for trackday enthusiasts wanting to go racing. It was launched in early 2010, and was run as a series with trophies being awarded at each round, rather than a championship with trophies awarded at the end of the season.
Organisers.
Club MSV is one the largest trackday operators in the UK. It offers various car and bike trackdays, for a range of experience levels, at parent company MotorSport Vision's circuits: Brands Hatch, Oulton Park, Snetterton and Cadwell Park.
The Series.
The Trackday Trophy is a novice race series that originated in 2010 to give trackday drivers the opportunity to go racing.
Cars must be fully compliant with MSA regulations (roll cage, fire extinguisher and cut off switches) but the relaxed regulations allow drivers who have already developed cars for trackdays to take part. Races are designed for teams of two drivers and classes are determined on a power-to-weight ratio. Each event consists of 30 minutes practice/qualifying, followed by a 45 minute race both of which will take place on one day. Teams must contain at least one novice driver who has competed in less than six races before. Experienced racers are permitted to race with a novice co-driver and solo entries are also acceptable from novices.
First year.
Following its launch, the Trackday Trophy targeted key media outlets to help promote the new series. Autosport's Marcus Pye gave the series a glowing tribute. Such articles helped the series build a small but strong following, with its end of season finale at Brands Hatch seeing grids of more than 20 cars.
2011.
For 2011, the Trackday Trophy continued its media push, with Evo Magazine running a competition to compete in the series. The series also drew excitement after confirming it would be one of the first categories to run on the new Snetterton 300 circuit.

The Lancashire Steel Company

The Lancashire Steel Company was a short-lived business operating from Manchester, England, in the 1860s. It was established to exploit the recent introduction of the Bessemer process for the manufacture of steel.
Bessemer process in Lancashire.
Lancashire, an English county, had a small iron industry prior to the invention and commercial exploitation of the Bessemer process. From the 1820s this was based solely in the Furness area, where three sites operated blast furnaces for the production of pig iron. Between the late 1850s and up until the 1880s the number and location of furnaces expanded considerably. The start of this growth roughly coincided with Bessemer providing practical proof of the usefulness of his process for the production of steel from pig iron. During this period there were 46 blast furnaces constructed around the county, many of which were outside the traditional centre of Furness.
Contiguous with the investment in the furnaces was an investment in the Bessemer conversion process itself, although this investment became uncommon beyond the mid-1870s. Several Lancashire businesses developed an interest in a short space of time, including the Barrow Hematite Steel Co. which started in 1864 and operated both furnaces and converters. Others included the old ironworks firm of Rushton and Eckersley, which installed converters around 1860 and was renamed as the Bolton Iron and Steel Co, and the Mersey Steel and Iron Co which installed then in 1865.
Most of the businesses of the area which took an early role in the process had existed as ironmakers and forgers prior to its introduction.
Origins.
Investors were sought in 1863 for a proposed new business, to be called The Lancashire Steel Company. It was intended ultimately to issue £150,000 in shares, the total being raised in stages over a period of two years. The company would develop a site at Gorton, Manchester, with buildings, blast furnaces, steam hammers, rolling mills and other facilities necessary to produce steel using the relatively new Bessemer process. Royalties would be paid to Bessemer for the licensing of his method, but only on 95% of the production in order to allow for waste. The promoters intended that the company would initially produce 200 tons of steel per week in blocks weighing up to 10 tons each. It was planned that the output would eventually be expanded to include the manufacture of blocks weighing up to 20 tons and that by this stage the company would be in a position to supply the maritime market.
The proposed site was adjacent to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR), for ease of transport of both raw materials and finished goods. The initial development was expected to take 18 months to put in place.
The prospectus announced that some of the directors and promoters of the company would also be consumers of its output and that the services had been obtained of a person (unnamed) who had expertise in the Bessemer process and that the individual concerned had invested £10,000 as a sign of confidence in the undertaking. The firm of W & J Galloway & Sons had been very closely involved with Bessemer in both the early development and subsequent practical implementation of his process and were listed as one of the promoters. The prospectus added that 
"The Mechanics' Magazine" wished the venture well, commenting that: "It has hitherto been rather disgraceful to English enterprise that we were unavoidably compelled to send to the Continent for the larger proportion of our steel forgings or castings."
By 1867 £96,000 of the shares had been issued.
Trading.
During 1864 the company was advertising itself as manufacturers of cast steel and files, as well as the only manufacturer of "Preston's Patent Self-Acting Machines for Forging and Cutting Files". The address given at that time was Lime Bank Street, Ardwick, and the advertisement went on to announce that 1000 tons of Bessemer steel per week would be produced when the works were completed, substantially more than envisaged in the prospectus. The company was seeking contracts for steel rail, engine crankshafts, steel plate, axles and other heavy industrial items. The Ardwick address was shown in a contemporary directory as being that of the Patent File Machine and File Manufacturing Co Ltd, of which Francis Preston was named the manager.
The steel produced comprised a mixture of different ores in an attempt to achieve the most useful material. In descending proportional order these were from the Workington, Harrington, West Cumberland, Wigan, Weardale and Forest of Dean areas. Spiegeleisen (an iron-carbon-manganese alloy) was added to the mixture.
The company claimed to have "conceded" an increase in the wages paid to its employees of 10%, which necessitated that it reduce its discount for both new files and the re-cutting of old files by 5% in 1868.
At some point during its short life, the company were producing engines for John Musgrave & Sons.
Management.
The board of directors in 1867 consisted of the following, all with addresses in Manchester:
Charles Beyer had been named a director in the 1863 prospectus but is not named in 1867; a similar circumstance applied to Edward Watkin, who was president of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. Neither Hall nor Ogden were named at all in the prospectus.
Francis Preston, who was an engineer of Francis Preston & Co, Ancoats Bridge Works, Manchester, was also listed as a director and is also variously referred to as "manager" and as "managing director". Preston had obtained provisional protection on a patent for "improvements in machinery and apparatus used in the manufacture of steel and iron" on 17 January 1866. He was also patentee of the above-mentioned file manufacturing and cutting methods, some of them in conjunction with a William McGregor, and in 1862 had opened works at Lime Bank Street for the Patent File Manufacturing Company Limited.
Failure and aftermath.
The company appointed a liquidator in September 1867. The site and plant was bought in 1871 by Bolckow Vaughan, who produced steel there using the Bessemer process for a time until the building of their steelworks at Eston, which commenced in 1874, were completed in 1877. The works had been bought deliberately as a stand-in measure and were subsequently sold to the MS&LR so that it could manufacture its own rails. The MS&LR had installed two converters at its works in 1872. There is some uncertainty regarding what happened thereafter but it is possible that the MS&LR sold the factory to the Standard Iron & Steel Co around 1882.
It was being noted as early as 1895 in the UK that the heyday of the Bessemer process was over and that the cheaper open hearth method predominated. The "Iron and Coal Trades Review" said that the process was "in a semi-moribund condition. Year after year, it has not only ceased to make progress, but it has absolutely declined." It has been suggested, both at that time and more recently, that the cause of this was the lack of trained personnel and investment in technology rather than any intrinsic issue of the process itself. Bessemer steel production in the Lancashire area had virtually ceased by 1900, with just one manufacturer still in existence at Workington.

Telocytes

Telocytes are a novel defined type of interstitial (stromal) cells, in the field of Stem cells, with very long (tens to hundreds of micrometres) and very thin prolongations (mostly below the resolving power of light microscopy).

Rationale for the term "telocyte".
Professor Laurențiu M. Popescu's group from Bucharest, Romania described a new type of cell. Popescu coined the terms Telocytes (TC) - for these cells, and "Telopodes" (Tp) for their extremely long but thin prolongations [1-7 in order to prevent further confusion with other interstitial (stromal) cells (e.g., fibroblast, fibroblast-like cells, myofibroblast, mesenchymal cells) (see Figs. 1-7). Telopodes present an alternation of thin segments,"podomeres" (with caliber mostly under 200 nm, below the resolving power of light microscopy) and dilated segments, "podoms", which accommodate mitochondria, (rough) endoplasmic reticulum and caveolae - the so-called ""Ca2+ uptake/release units"".
The concept of TC was promptly adopted by other laboratories, as well [8-18].
"Telocytes" and/or fibroblasts ?
The interstitium (stroma) is in most of the cases seen as a connecting "device" for the specific structures of an organ. Usually, people perceive interstitial cells as being mainly (or even, only) fibroblasts. However, fibroblasts have the function of generating connective tissue matrix, specifically, collagen. The distinction between TC and fibroblasts is obvious since they have different ultrastructure and phenotype. Therefore, their functions should be mostly different: TC - intercellular signaling (connections), but fibroblasts - collagen synthesis. In other words, TC are "more" functionally oriented while fibroblasts are "more" structurally oriented, responsible for fibrosis.
There are some clear ultrastructural features that differentiate telocytes from fibroblasts. For instance, the general aspect of TC is of a small oval (piriform/spindle/triangular/stellate)-shaped cellular body, containing a nucleus surrounded by a small amount of cytoplasm. Anyway, the shape of the cell body depends on the number of Tp. Fibroblast cell body is pleomorphic (phenotype heterogeneity?). TC cellular body average dimensions are, as measured on EM images, 9.3 μm ± 3.2 μm (min. 6.3μm; max. 16.4 μm). Fibroblast nucleus is typically euchromatic, but TC nucleus is mostly heterochromatic. Mitochondria represent only 2% of cell body volume and the Golgi complex is small in TC. Fibroblasts Golgi complex is prominent and the rough endoplasmic reticulum is very well developed (usually 5-12%) of cell volume.
Since "telopodes" are distinctive for "telocytes", here are their main features:
Summary.
Here is shown visual evidence (electron microscopy, electron tomography, phase contrast microscopy) for the existence of Telocytes (TC) in many organs from human and rodents. TC and Tp, and also podoms and podomeres were found in:
Recent evidence shows the involvement of TC in pathology . TC are strategically located in between blood vessels (capillaries), nerve endings and the specific resident cell population(s) of a given organ. TC establish via Tp homo- and heterocellular junctions and release shed vesicles and exosomes.
Perspectives: regenerative medicine.
TC and SC make a tandem (due to specific intercellular junctions) within the so-called "SC niches", at least in heart and lungs. Hence, TC could be key-players in regenerating and repair of some organs. The tandem TC-SC could be a better option for therapy rather than SC alone. Published studies suggest that cardiac TCs could be regarded as a potential cell source for therapeutic use to improve cardiac repair and function after a myocardial infarction, either alone or in tandem with SC [30.
Recent data show that TCs are completely different from FBs, using a quantitative proteomics approach, suggesting that TCs might play specific roles in mechanical sensing and mechanochemical conversion task, tissue homoeostasis and remodelling/renewal .

Hiddush

Hiddush () meaning "innovation, renewal", full name "Hiddush – For Religious Freedom and Equality", is a trans-denominational nonprofit organization founded in 2009 which is aimed at promoting religious freedom and equality in Israel. The organization, a partnership between Israeli Jews and World Jewry, is headed by Jerusalem-based attorney and rabbi Uri Regev, former President of the World Union for Progressive Judaism as its president and CEO, and American businessman Stanley P. Gold, member of the Reform Wilshire Boulevard Temple and former Chairman of the Board of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.
Hiddush is supported by a number of prominent Jews, among them businessman Charles Bronfman, Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, producer Norman Lear, authors Amos Oz and Letty Cottin Pogrebin, professor Amnon Rubinstein, and Gili Zivan of the Religious Kibbutz Movement.
Goals.
Supported by the Conservative, the Reconstructionist and the Reform movements, Hiddush aims to change the existing religious power structure in Israel, with its Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox dominance, realizing the words of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which states that “The State of Israel ... will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture”.
Among the organization′s stated goals are the legalization of civil as well as religious marriage and divorce, ensuring recognition for Conservative, Reconstructionist and Reform marriages and conversions, full rights for rabbis of all Jewish denominations, providing equal funding for non-Orthodox religious services, and civic equality in education, employment and military service. Hiddush also pledges to fight discrimination against women and to demand that yeshivas meet requirements for teaching non-religious subjects. The organization advocates for freedom of religion and consciousness, but not necessarily a complete separation of religion and state.
According to Rabbi Regev, the social problems facing Israel are caused by the religious involvement in the state, including inequality in education, employment and army service, discrimination against women, refusal of ultra-Orthodox schools to implement the legal requirement for teaching mathematics, English, sciences and civics and the limitations on use of public transportation. Stanley Gold′s concern is that Israeli economy may be reduced to a third-world level within ten years due to the fact that a quarter of Jewish students in Israel study in the ultra-Orthodox school system, where they don′t study English or science, if a drastic shift in the ultra-Orthodox school curriculum does not occur and an increase in ultra-Orthodox men′s participation in the workforce doesn't take place. 60 percent of ultra-Orthodox men in Israel study in yeshivas and do not work, supporting their families solely with government stipends. Different studies have found that ultra-Orthodox men′s avoidance of joining the Israeli job market costs Israel NIS 5 to 15 billion ($ 1.3 to 4 billion) annually.
Activities.
During its start-up year, Hiddush has been operating on a $ 500,000 budget and skeleton staff. It has a series of long-range projects, such as forming alliances with like-minded groups, using the social media in Israel and the Diaspora, publishing investigative media reports, legal challenges, “report cards” on the votes of Knesset members, and special outreach to Russian immigrants in Israel.
Religion and State Index.
Hiddush conducts a "“Religion and State Index”" evaluated by public opinion surveys it commissions. The first survey of 1,200 adult Jewish Israelis conducted by the Smith Research Institute in Summer 2009, shows that 
Its latest survey of 800 adult Jewish Israelis conducted by the Smith Research Institute in Summer 2010 shows that
The studies show “strong support for a range of matters of religious freedom and equality amongst the general Israeli population. This suggests that mainstream Israelis, across the social and political spectrum, are open to fundamental change in the longstanding status quo agreements which have granted monopoly powers to the ultra-Orthodox political parties and chief rabbinate. Israelis seek a more free and egalitarian society, in which all citizens receive more equal status, both in rights and duties.”
Research and Reports.
In the beginning of 2013, Hiddush released several reports regarding the role of religion in Israeli politics. Several days following the Knesset elections on January 22, 2013, Hiddush released a report, conducted by the Smith Research Institute, which showed that 80% of the Jewish public in Israel support establishing a civil government coalition that will advance the agenda of religious freedom and equality. Within the survey, Hiddush also looked at voters' attitudes towards the role of religion in the next government coalition and whether or not the ultra-Orthodox parties should be included in the coalition. 
Specifically on whether or not the next government should prioritize an agenda based on civil issues, the report found that:
The polling additionally found that 54% of Jewish voters think that the next government coalition should not include the ultra-Orthodox parties
On February 7, 2013, Hiddush released an investigative report which showed that in 2010, NIS 1.05 billion was allocated to religious institutions through additional budget transfers. These transfers were carried out through the Knesset Finance Committee. In 2011, NIS 826 million were transferred to religious institutions and exclusively went through the Finance Committee, which is chaired by ultra-Orthodox UTJ party member, Moshe Gafni.
Freedom of Marriage World Map.
In May 2013, Hiddush launched the Freedom of Marriage World Map. It is the first online resource to provide a global comparison of freedom of marriage. The interactive website features a color-coded map in black, grey, and white, representing the grading from 0-2. 
-45 countries around the world, 23% of the 194 countries examined have severe restrictions on freedom of marriage (grade 0).
-In 56 countries (29%) there are partial restrictions on freedom of marriage (grade 1).
-Freedom of marriage or almost full freedom of marriage (grade 2) exists in almost half of the world's countries (93 countries or 48%).
The research for the map found that almost every country in Europe and 75% of the Americas permit full or almost-full freedom of marriage. 73% (33 countries) of the countries that received "0" (severe restrictions) are Muslim and enforce Sharia law.
Israel received a "0" in the report. The strict religious monopoly on marriages in Israel results in hundreds of thousands of citizens who are denied the right of marriage altogether and millions more who are deprived of the ability to choose a marriage ceremony that befits their beliefs.
The map's research was headed by Natasha Roth. The project was produced by Hiddush Spokesman, Miki Sokolovsky and edited by Hiddush Vice President for Research and Information, Shahar Ilan. The map was designed and built by Lionways Inc with assistance from the New Israel Fund.

Jovan Monasterlija

Jovan Monasterlija (; fl. 1683–1706) was a Serbian "vice-voivode" (podvojvoda) and Austrian (Holy Roman Empire) imperial officer that led a Serb army against the Ottoman Empire and other enemies of the Austrian Emperor. He was titled "Chief of the Serbian Nation" by Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.
Monasterlija was born to father Petar in Komorn County, where his ancestors had settled in 1606 from Srpski Kovin, possibly originally from Bitola (Monastir), hence his epithet "Monasterlija" (Turkish: Monastirli, "of Monastir"). His family was of noble status, his father had been granted noble status in 1655.
Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, led the capture of Belgrade in 1688 from the Ottomans, with the full support of Serbian insurgents under the command of Monasterlija. Between 1689 and 1692, central parts of present-day Serbia were controlled by the Habsburg crown. In 1689 Monasterlija was sent to defend Golubac. On 11 April 1691, he was appointed the military commander of the Serb Army (called "Monasterlijini Raci" – Monasterlija's Serbs), after Serbs demanded their own leaders while going to battle. His command was of more than 10,000 volunteer Serb soldiers, and was to be under the direct supervision of the Aulic War Council, the soldiers were highly regarded by Leopold.
He took part in the Battle of Slankamen and Battle of Senta. After the wars he gains overlordship of the Petrovaradin fortress, and is appointed to overlook the building of a pontoon bridge over the Danube. He retired after the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 and was given land by Leopold. He was nevertheless sent to fight off the uprising of Francis II Rákóczi against the Habsburgs in 1703. He succeeded and was given the title of general. Leopold, just before his death, gave Jovan the task of integrating the Serb units into the regular Austrian army. He died from wounds sustained during the siege of Oradea.
He was married to Ana Rašković, a member of the Rašković noble family.
Jovan contributed to the Fruška Gora monasteries. He died in 1706 and was buried in Šišatovac, where his tomb lays, with the coat of arms of the family.

Persoonia rigida

Persoonia rigida, commonly known as the rigid-, hairy- or stiff geebung, is a shrub native to New South Wales and Victoria in eastern Australia. First collected by George Caley in 1804, it was one of the many Australian plants first described by Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and still bears the binomial name he gave it in 1830. Within the genus "Persoonia", "P. rigida" is classified in the "lanceolata" group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur. It grows as a small shrub to 1 m (4 ft) high, and has hairy new branches and leaves. The narrow leaves measure 1.5 to 4.5 cm (0.6-1.8 in) long, and 0.4–1.9 cm wide and are spathulate or obovate in shape, with margins turning downwards. Appearing in summer, the inflorescences are composed of single yellow flowers and have hairy perianths. The proportion of flowers going on to develop fruit appears to be unusually high in "P. rigida" compared with other members of the genus.
"Persoonia rigida" is found from the Liverpool Range in Central New South Wales southwards into Central Victoria, where it reaches the Grampians National Park. It occurs on the inland (north and west) side of the Great Dividing Range, but extends eastwards to Springwood in the Lower Blue Mountains. The altitude ranges from 300 to 1300 m (1000-4000 ft). It grows in sandstone-based or rocky soils in dry sclreophyll forest or heathland. It has been known to hybridise with the prickly geebung ("P. juniperina"), as well as "P. sericea". Associated tree species in Victoria include "Eucalyptus macrorhyncha" and" Eucalyptus polyanthemos". 
"Persoonia rigida" was cultivated in England in 1824 but is seldom seen in gardens now, and has little horticultural appeal.

Stephen McDonnell (footballer)

Stephen McDonnell (born 20 March 1992 in Dundalk) is a footballer who plays for Shelbourne.
Dundalk.
Stephen McDonnell is a central midfielder who played with local club Quay Celtic before moving to Glasgow Celtic where he spent 18 months before returning to Ireland in January 2010. He signed for Dundalk the following March and made his full debut for the club when starting against Bray Wanderers at the Carlisle Grounds in the Leinster Senior Cup on 24 May, a tie which Dundalk lost 4-3 on penalties after the sides had ended level at 2-2 after 120 minutes of action. McDonnell made his league bow shortly after with a second-half substitute appearance at home to Sporting Fingal on 8 June and he scored his first club goal a month later with a bullet header against local rivals Drogheda United at Oriel Park. In total during the 2010 campaign, he made 13 appearances in all competitions, including two in the UEFA Europa League, the second of which was a start at home to Levski Sofia on 22 July.
At the end of the season, McDonnell expressed his wish to try his luck in the UK once more, and he went on trial at Queens Park Rangers, which was arranged by Tony Awor. However, he returned to Ireland and on 2 December he signed a fresh one-year deal with Dundalk, with the youngster stating: “I’m very happy to have signed here again. It will be good to get another year of first-team football under my belt after getting a taste of it this year. Obviously, I know I’m not going to play week in, week out, but hopefully I’ll play a bigger part next season and progress again. It’s a very competitive league and I think another year here will benefit me. Recently, I was over on trial with Queens Park Rangers; I was keeping my options open and having a look around. QPR just didn’t happen for me. I had one or two other interested clubs but I felt the best thing for me was to come back here and play first-team football next season.” He was named vice-captain of Dundalk for the 2012 season.
International.
Stephen has represented the Republic of Ireland at a number of levels, and since joining Dundalk he has appeared in a green jersey on eight occasions. The sixth of those, back on 7 October, saw him score his first international goal when he netted in a 5-0 win for the U19s over Luxembourg in Bulgaria. On 8 August last, McDonnell was rewarded for his performances at U17 level when named the International U17 Player of the Year. After receiving that award, the youngster, who is nicknamed Sam, told dundalkfc.com: “Obviously, it’s great to win such a big award and it’s a great honour in my career. It’s great to have on my CV. There were three of us in the running so obviously I thought I was going to have a good chance, so I was delighted to get it. I’m over the moon with it, really. I was shocked when they first called out my name. I knew I had a chance because it was down to three, but it was a surprise.

Oxfendazole

Oxfendazole is the sulfoxide form of fenbendazole, a broad spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic. Its main use is for protecting livestock against roundworm, strongyles and pinworms.
Oxfendazole is an anthelmintic (wormer) compound used in veterinary practice. It comes under the chemical class of the benzimidazoles. This drug is barely used in horses, goats, sheep, and cattle. It is very scarcely applied on dogs and cats. The drug for livestock is majorly available in the form of pills, tablets, drenches, bolus, etc. They are meant for oral consumption. Several drenches are allowed for intraruminal injection in some of the countries. Few countries also prefer injectables and pour-ons. For pet dogs, the drug is available in the form of drenches. 
EFFICACY OF OXFENDAZOLE
Oxfendazole is fenbendazole sulfoxide’s main metabolite. They are highly effective. They are efficient against gastrointestinal lungworms and roundworms of livestock, adults, and L4-larvae of the significant species for example, of the genus of Bunostomum, Haemonchus, Ostertagia - Oesophagostomum, Nematodirus, Teladorsagia, Cooperia, Trichostrongylus, Dictyocaulus, Trichuris, etc, including against arrested larvae of some of the species. They are even highly efficient against majority of the livestock tapeworms. This drug works effectively against the main parasitic roundworms and tapeworms of dogs and cats.
The drug offers a small residual effect in ruminants unless and otherwise it is delivered by using a slow-release device. This essentially means that on a single administration it will help in killing the parasites which are present in the host during the time of treatment and also prevent against re-infestations for some more days but not weeks or months. The residual effect is comparatively shorter in non-ruminants. The drug is non-effective against flukes and external parasites at therapeutic dose.

Canadian Headstones

Canadian Headstones is a project to capture digital images and the complete transcription of cemetery stones. It is a web-based Canadian Non-Profit Corporation which is run completely by volunteers.
History.
Jim McKane began his genealogical quest in the early 1970s when his father convinced him to become the keeper of the pedigree for his Lyons Clan Reunion in Chinguacousy Township, Peel County, Ontario. In April 2009, while volunteering as assistant webmaster of a website, he found a website archiving headstones for those who were born in County Tyrone, Ireland, the home of his ancestors.
Realizing the value of the information to genealogists and family historians, he set out to research the possibility of creating an archive for Canadian headstones. While there were a number of websites storing photos of gravestones, none also included the inscriptions on the gravestones. The majority of existing sites also had either no search engine feature or very poorly constructed search features. The result was the creation on 1 July 2009 of CanadianHeadstones.com
The bylaws of Canadian Headstones state that the purpose of the corporation is: the corporation shall gather, archive, publish and disseminate genealogical, historical data or other records of interest to family historians, genealogists or other researchers.
Use.
Canadian Headstones relies on volunteers to upload photos. The site steps a contributor through uploading a photo, editing it, choosing a county and cemetery, entering the names and inscription. It is then checked by a Coordinator who assists the contributor to fix any problems. 
In the first two years CanadianHeadstones.com had 220,000 records submitted to the site.

Beit Jimal Monastery

Beit Jimal (or Beit Jamal; ; ) is a Catholic monastery, run by Salesian monks. The property was purchased in 1878 by Fr Antonio Belloni, who set up the Beit Gemal School of Agriculture for the benefit of poor youth, especially orphans. The Salesians took over the institution in 1892, after Fr Belloni joined them together with some other priests. The monastery is located in the Judean hills next to the city of Beit Shemesh. There are actually two separate monasteries, one for men and a second for women, as well as a small and well-appointed church, called St. Stephen, built in 1930 on the ruins of a 5th-century Byzantine church discovered on the site. The monastery has a small shop that offers locally made olive oil and red wines. There is a small concert hall, where concerts are played on some weekends. 
The nuns do not belong to Salesian Sisters, but rather to the Sisters of Bethlehem, part of the Sisters of the Assumption of the Virgin and the Sisters of Saint Bruno. These nuns have taken a vow of silence.
Name.
In Arabic and Hebrew the site is known as Beit Jamal – the monastery is sometimes referenced as Beit Gemal or Beit Jimal. The name of the site is said to be from its local name (in years past), Kfar Gamla, purportedly so named for Rabban Gamliel I, or Gamaliel in Greek – president of the Sanhedrin. The Christian tradition believes that Gamaliel was buried here, as were St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr and Nicodemus. In 415 their remains were disclosed in a dream and discovered by the priest Lucian, and removed at the orders of John, Bishop of Jerusalem, for depositing in the Church of Hagia Sion on Mt. Zion, at the site of today's Abbey of the Dormition. Thanks to the excavations carried out by Andrzej Strus on site, it is now largely accepted that in Byzantine times this was considered to be the burial site of St Stephen, Gamaliel, Nicodemus and Gamaliel's son Abibos. In 2003, near a circular structure uncovered by Strus, was found a stone architrave or lintel with a tabula ansata. The writing on it was eventually deciphered by Emile Puech, expert in ancient writing from the Ecole Biblique. The writing ran: "DIAKONIKON STEPHANOU PROTOMARTYROS", "the diakonikon of Stephen the Protomartyr". A diakonikon of a Byzantine church was one of the two spaces or chapels flanking the sanctuary, which often housed holy relics. This is therefore solid evidence for identifying Bet Gemal with the ancient Kfar Gamla, the traditional burial site of St Stephen.

Kathleen Ngale

Kathleen Ngale (alternative spellings include Kngale, Kngala, Kngal, Ngala etc.) is a senior Australian Aboriginal artist, born ca. 1930 in the Utopia region of Central Australia. Kathleen Ngale belongs to the oldest living generation of Utopia artists and has in the last two decades emerged as one of the greatest Aboriginal artists, having been compared to such eminent figures as Emily Kngwarreye, Minnie Pwerle or Kathleen Petyarre, due both to her senior status and the uncommon quality of her work.
Life.
Kathleen Ngale was born around 1930 at the Camel Camp Station, 250 km north-East of Alice Springs, where she still lives with her extended family. She started working in Batik in 1979 and pursued her work in that medium until she, along with many other Aboriginal artists, was introduced in the late 1980s to painting in acrylic colours on canvas. Her work since then has come to be seen as some of the most sophisticated and complex in the Aboriginal art scene. She has been featured in many exhibitions, both in Australia and overseas, and she was a finalist in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Award in both 2000 and 2008. Kathleen Ngale is now the senior custodian of the cultural knowledge of her country, Arlparra. Her younger sisters Polly Ngale and Angelina Pwerle Ngale are also accomplished artists.
Work.
Kathleen Ngale's works are a depiction of her country, Arlparre, and its 'Bush Plum' (anwekety) Dreaming. Her paintings are made up of numerous layers of superimposed dots, creating a feeling of depth, light and movement. There is virtually as much hidden in these works as there is visible in a surface reading, with many underdotting colour planes shimmering through the top layers in a highly complex interplay. Her subtly dotted underpainting often consists of yellows, reds, purples, greens, over which she then often applies a thick layer of overdotting which almost obscures the underdotting altogether or fuses with it to create a surface of delicate, fragile colour softer than the original underdotting, red and white often fusing into a translucent, fleshy white/pink. The colour is often thickly applied or washed out, but then in the surface of the same canvas the overdotting can in some parts become very sparse, allowing the viewer to see down through the painting's surface into a field of deep or 'negative' space. Sasha Grishin, Sir William Dobell Professor of Art History at the Australian National University, wrote in 2009: "Although Kathleen Kngale has been painting for over two decades , it is only in recent years that she has been acclaimed as one of the most significant and exciting artists in contemporary Utopia painting, creating memorable and visually dazzling paintings... She is an artist who has created an unique and distinctive stylistic language, one of great visual power and spiritual resonance." 
Her works (as well as those of her sister Polly, born ca. 1940) have become sought after in recent years.

Persoonia juniperina

Persoonia juniperina, commonly known as the prickly geebung, is a shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It was first collected in Tasmania, and described by French naturalist Jacques Labillardière in 1805. Within the genus "Persoonia", "P. juniperina" is classified in the lanceolata group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur. The species itself is variable across its range and separate subspecies have been recognised in the past, although the latest consensus is that the change is uniform enough not to warrant status for subspecies. It grows as a small spreading shrub 0.3 to 2 m (1-7 ft) high, and has smooth bark, hairy new branches and leaves. The narrow leaves measure 0.8 to 3.5 cm (0.3-1.6 in) long, and 1.5 mm wide and are linear in shape. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to May). As with all persoonias, the flowers are followed by the appearance of small fleshy fruit. These may have been eaten by aborigines. A field study manipulating pollination showed "P. juniperina" was partly self-compatible but cross-pollination led to greater fruit production.
"Persoonia juniperina" is found across Tasmania and on mainland southeastern Australia, from Green Cape on the New South Wales far south coast through Victoria and into southeastern South Australia as far as Adelaide. The habitat is sclerophyll forest and heath to an altitude of 700 m (2500 ft). It appears to be vulnerable to disturbance.

<doc id="31056793" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31056793" title="Pirinixic acid">
Pirinixic acid

Pirinixic acid is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist that is under experimental investigation for prevention of severe cardiac dysfunction, cardiomyopathy and heart failure as a result of lipid accumulation within cardiac myocytes. Treatment is primarily aimed at individuals with an adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) enzyme deficiency or mutation because of the essential PPAR protein interactions with free fatty acid monomers derived from the ATGL catalyzed lipid oxidation reaction. It was discovered as WY-14,643 in 1974.
Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL).
Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting hydrolysis step of triglycerides in the triacylglycerol lipolysis cascade, is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, but is also found in lesser amounts within cardiac and skeletal muscle. Its function is to initiate the breakdown of intracellular triglycerides into fatty acid monomers. Individuals deficient in the ATGL enzyme are at higher risk for cardiac dysfunction and premature death because of increased size and accumulation of lipid droplets within cardiac myocytes.
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs).
PPARs are a family of ligand activated receptors which include PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ subtypes that are expressed in varying amounts in nuclear membranes of in different tissues. PPAR activation occurs with free fatty acid binding, or fatty acid derivative ligands that have been broken down via the triacylglycerol lipolysis cascade. Activated PPARs act as transcription factors to increase expression of specific genes within cells. PPARα, a PPAR subtype, controls the expression of genes involved in cardiac fatty acid utilization, and its activation, stimulates free fatty acid oxidation by increasing mitochondrial free fatty acid uptake and oxidation via two enzymes: carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (M-CPT I) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD).
Pre-clinical trials.
ATGL deficient mice administered pirinixic acid demonstrated reduced cardiac hypertrophy and improved cardiac function. These data demonstrate that genes induced by PPARα activation via free fatty acids from ATGL-dependent reactions are essential for the maintenance of normal cardiac function. As PPARα activation triggers the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (M-CPTI I and MCAD), treating the mice with pirinixic acid may improve cardiac myocyte energy supply by increasing mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation to prevent severe cardiac dysfunction as a result of lipid accumulation .

Karol Kot

Karol Kot (December 18, 1946 - May 16, 1968) was a Polish serial killer. Kot terrorized Kraków, the city he was born and raised in, with monstrous crimes for two years before he was finally captured on July 12, 1966. Because of the accidental choice of the victims which included children and elderly people, as well as the horror his crimes evoked in the citizens of Kraków, Kot was remembered as the Kraków’s vampire and a monster. Before his detention, Kot acted as a normal young citizen, who passed the school-leaving examinations in high school and planned to become a student at an Officer Candidate School. After the trial, in which he pleaded guilty of the crimes he was charged with, the killer was sentenced to death, which was announced on July 14, 1967. The death penalty was executed on May 16, 1968.
Early life.
Kot spent his whole life in Kraków. He and his 8 years younger sister were looked after by their unemployed mother. Kot had no problems at school, although there was an unsuccessful attempt at getting accepted into a technical college of communication. He also suffered from a nervous breakdown because of failing one of the subjects at college. Eventually, he became a student of the technical college of energetic, where he passed the school-leaving examinations. Apart from the school organizations he was a member of, including ZMS, LOK and ORMO, Kot thrived in the shooting section in the “Cracovia” club.
Hobbies and interests.
Kot’s inclinations were given away by his particular interest in every kind of weapon that could inflict pain and death on human beings. He was in possession of a substantial amount of knives, studied human anatomy and enjoyed the taste of animal blood as well as the act of killing the animals himself. In addition to that, Kot was versatile in the use of firearms and remained in close contact with the coach of his shooting section, who sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice in protest against Kot’s detention.
Criminal record.
In September, 1964 Karol Kot attacked for the first time. The victim of this first, grave crime was an elderly woman whom he stabbed in church. He drove the knife from behind when, unsuspecting, she knelt down to pray. Fortunately, the woman survived. The second attempted murder occurred shortly after, on 23 September, when Kot spotted an old lady coming out of the tram. He followed her and stabbed her in the back when the time was right. This attack was unsuccessful as well. He finally managed to kill a person six days later, on 29 September. Similarly, his victim was an old lady whom he spotted near the church and followed her to Jan Street where he stabbed her to death, driving a knife from behind and aiming at the heart.
On 13 February 1966 Kot stabbed to death an 11-year-old boy near Kościuszko Mound where a toboggan contest for children took place. In April 1966 he attempted a murder of an 8-year-old girl. Kot came to the tenement in Sobieskiego Street and noticed a girl who came downstairs to collect letters from the mailbox. He grabbed her and inflicted 8 stab wounds to the stomach, chest and back. When he escaped, the girl managed to go home and shortly after was taken to hospital where the doctors managed to save her life.
Apart from that, Kot tried to kill people by poisoning. He bought some arsenic and went to a bar called “Przy Błoniach.” He ordered some beer and a jelly, took a bottle of vinegar from the counter and sat at the table. When he was certain that nobody was looking, he inserted some arsenic into the vinegar bottle hoping that somebody will use it later on and get poisoned. He would often leave bottles of beer or soda poisoned with arsenic in popular places but nobody would ever drink them. He also poured a large quantity of arsenic into his schoolmate's drink but the boy noticed suspicious chemical smell and did not drink it. During the trial, the expert witnesses stated that the amount of arsenic used by Kot was enough to kill anybody who would drink the beverage.
Trial and sentence.
Kot was arrested before his matura exam but he was allowed to write the examination in order to prove that he was sane and he will not plead insanity during the trial. He was charged with 2 murders, 10 attempted murders and 4 arsons. A lot of expert witnesses were appointed in order to find the cause of Kot’s psychopathic behaviour. They discovered that Kot has shown strange inclinations since his early childhood. During the summer he would go to the slaughterhouse and watch the pigs being butchered. Watching it as well as drinking the pig’s still warm blood was a source of pleasure for him. Kot soon started to kill animals himself and he indulged in studying anatomy books and imagining wounds that can be inflicted on people.
After a series of psychological observations and examinations, the doctors asserted that Kot was completely sane and he can attend the trial with full consequences of his actions. The verdict was declared on 14 July 1967. Kot was declared guilty and sentenced to death as well as he lost citizen rights. The sentence was carried out on 16 May 1968.
Moral grounds.
When asked in an interview whether he was aware of the notion of murder being a crime and an evil deed, Kot shortly presented his moral standards. According to him, what determines moral appropriateness of people’s actions is the fact that they bring an individual satisfaction and a sense of fulfilled duty; he therefore considered himself a murderer, but not an evil person. Apart from that, he mythicized himself into being a chosen one, the rare person able to comprehend the act of drinking blood as something sacred and empowering.

Fateh Singh Rathore

Fateh Singh Rathore (10 August 1938 – 1 March 2011) is India's best known tiger conservationist. Fateh Singh joined the Indian Forest Service in 1960 and was part of the first Project Tiger team. He was widely acknowledged as the "tiger guru" for his legendary knowledge of the big cat. He worked over 50 years in wildlife conservation. Rathore was noted for his pioneering relocation of villages from inside the Ranthambhore National Park in 1973–75. Largely because of Mr. Rathore, “"Ranthambhore became the place which brought the tiger to the consciousness of people the world over."”
Early life.
Fateh Singh Rathore was born in Choradia village in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan. He was the eldest son in a family of 6 boys and 5 girls. His grandfather Laxman Singh Rathore was a Subedar in the army. Rathore’s father, Sagat Singh, was the eldest son of Laxman Singh. He was a police officer and managed the family’s land and property in their village near Jodhpur.
His mother loved him very dearly, and was a very bold lady, protecting him from his grandfather’s anger when he was mischievous. She died in February 2010.
Rathore’s uncles, one in the army, and the other a lawyer, helped bring him up. He was sent away to Col. Brown Cambridge School,a boarding school,in Dehra Dun and later stayed with an uncle while a college student. He was not interested in his studies, preferring to take part in dramas etc. and have fun. His uncle wanted him to be a lawyer, but his heart was not in it. Rathore graduated from the Rajputana University in 1960. After working as a store clerk and selling coal, Rathore was offered a job as a park ranger by an uncle who had become deputy minister of forests in Rajasthan.
Conservation work.
Rathore joined the Rajasthan Forest Service on the advice of his uncle. One of his first jobs was organising tiger hunts in the area which later became Ranthambhore National Park (RNP) during a visit by the Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in January 1961. The first tiger he ever saw was one shot by the Duke: “I was not in love with the tiger at the time. We were very happy that we succeeded,” he recalled.
He loved the forest service, and grew very interested in conservation. He was posted as a game warden at Sariska when there were still tigers there. He worked at Mount Abu Game Reserve between 1963 and 1970. Rathore was posted in 1971 as game warden in Ranthambhore. The area of RNP, though degraded, still existed as a forest because it was the game reserve of the royal family of Jaipur. He was sent to the Wildlife Institute of India for training, in the first batch of forest officers to be trained there in 1969. While there he showed a greater aptitude for field work and was not too interested in theory. He fared well there and his guru, S. R. Choudhury, recognized his potential.
"Project Tiger".
Project Tiger (PT) was started in 1973 at the instance of Indira Gandhi, who was very concerned about the fact that the number of wild tigers was reducing because of hunting. Hunting was banned from then on, and 9 reserves were selected under PT. Ranthambhore was one of them. Rathore was sent there as the Assistant Field Director, but was given a free hand by his senior.
At that time, the area looked very different. There were wheat fields where Padam Talao now stands – there had been an artificially created lake there, which the villagers had drained for their agriculture, and he restored the lake along with Raj Bagh and Malik Talao. 16 villages dotted the whole area, with no roads connecting them with each other. The villagers lived in extreme poverty and deprivation, with no health care or educational facilities. The vegetation had all been eaten by domestic cattle. There were wild animals around, but they emerged mostly at night and were rarely seen.
Rathore went about carving roads through the area, patrolling it regularly, and realized that the villages needed to be moved out if the tigers were to have any chance of flourishing. It required a huge amount of tact and patience to convince people to leave their homes, and Rathore frequently found himself crying along with the villagers. He managed to convince a young schoolteacher about the benefits of moving to another location, making him his wife’s rakhi brother. The villagers were given a good compensation package, and finally moved to a newly established village called Kailashpuri which had a health centre and a school, and better agricultural land outside the park.
Once the villages were moved out, (1973-5), the park’s vegetation started regenerating on its own. Soon Rathore began to see the pugmarks of tigers, but they were still nocturnal. A lame buffalo had been left behind by the villagers, and when he saw the pugmarks of a tigress and cubs in that area, he knew that she would kill the animal sooner or later. One day he found that the buffalo had been killed, so he climbed a tree and waited there. The tigress soon appeared with her cubs and started feeding. She was aware of Rathore up in the tree and snarled at him a couple of times. He was so excited that his hands shook as he took photos. Later, he had many opportunities to study this tigress whom he named Padmini after his elder daughter, and she tolerated his presence benignly.
In August 1981 Rathore was nearly killed by a group of villagers who resented being sent away from the park area because they used to collect fees from others for allowing their cattle to graze there. He was beaten up and left for dead with several fractures and a head injury, and it took several months for him to recover. Later he was given a bravery award for this. When he recovered he went back and confronted the villagers. Nothing was going to stop him from trying to save his tigers.
Tiger Watch.
In the 1990s a group of friends got together to form an NGO called Tiger Watch (TW), of which Rathore was made the Vice-Chairman. At first the Rajasthan Forest Department allowed TW to carry out research in the park. In 2003 a young wildlife biologist called Dharmendra Khandal (DK) was selected by TW to carry out research. In 2004 DK produced a report which contradicted the Forest Department’s claim that the census showed 45 tigers in the park. According to DK’s report there were just 26. He substantiated his claim with photographs taken by camera traps, a more foolproof method of tiger population estimation than the old method of taking plaster casts of pugmarks. The forest department not only denied this, but banned TW henceforth from carrying out any research within the park. TW set up an anti-poaching project, and with the help of the police, succeeded in arresting several poachers and confiscating their weapons, sometimes pre-empting their raids. Poachers’ confessions were recorded on video, and a DVD was produced called “Curbing the Crisis”. The Forest Department continued to be in a state of denial and resentment.
Realising that the poachers are mainly from the Mogya tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers with no other means of livelihood, TW has started a rehabilitation programme for them, involving the women in handicraft production, and setting up a hostel where their children can be clothed, fed and educated, to give them some dignity and better prospects in future. This is strictly on condition that the men give up poaching. As this exercise depends solely on donations from well-wishers, funds are always a problem to collect, but the efforts go on.
TW has a sister organisation called the Prakrtik Society, set up by Rathore’s son Goverdhan. This organisation has set up a hospital (Ranthambhore Sevika) and the Fateh Public School for local community as part of efforts towards community conservation.
He appeared in an episode of The Jeff Corwin Experience.
Rathore always believed in working with the people to save the tiger and in a country with billion population only this people-centric approach worked.
Rathore died of lung cancer at his home in Sawai Madhopur on 1 March 2011 at age 72. Rathore is survived by his wife, Khen; his son, Goverdhan; two daughters, Padmini and Jaya; four brothers; four sisters; and four grandchildren.
His commitment to tiger conservation was summed up in 1993: “"The forest and all its creatures were the creation of the god"s," he argued over the village fires, “"Did not the goddess Durga, the slayer of demons, herself ride a tiger? No man had a right to disturb that divine creation. The forest must be left to grow back."”
Honours and awards.
Rathore received several awards and honors in recognition of his tiger conservation work.
Publications.
Picture and articles by FSR about wild tigers in Ranthambhore have been published in several books and periodicals including:

Telosphrantis

Telosphrantis is a genus of moths in the Choreutidae family, containing only one species, Telosphrantis aethiopica, which is known from Ethiopia.
The length of the forewings is about 7 mm. The head is brown with some buff scales mixed in. The thorax is brown and the forewings are unicolorous dark brown or fuscous, with one narrow buff mark on the costal margin. The hindwings are unicolorous fuscous.
Taxonomy.
The genus was described and placed in the family Yponomeutidae by Meyrick in 1932. The 
genus and species was not studied again until Clarke examined specimens at the British Museum in 1965 and selected a lectotype. Clarke retained the species in Yponomeutidae. Study of the type and syntypes led to a transfer to the Choreutidae family.

Adebisi Shank

Adebisi Shank are a three-piece instrumental rock trio from Wexford, Ireland consisting of guitarist Larry Kaye, bass guitarist Vincent McCreith and drummer Michael Roe. The band was signed to Richter Collective in Ireland, before the record label closed in December in 2012, Big Scary Monsters in the United Kingdom, Sargent House in the United States and Parabolica in Japan. Their name is a reference to the Oz character Simon Adebisi. Having a style of music described as "seriously upbeat math-rocky craziness" they have released two studio albums and one extended play in their career.
The band recently announced via their Facebook page that they have completed the recording of their upcoming third album.
History.
The band formed in August 2006, after both drummer Mick Roe and guitarist Lar Kaye, who worked together in math rock band "Terrordactyl" collaborated with bass player Vinny McCreith, who at the time worked on a solo chiptune project named "The Vinny Club". The groups name, which derives from the Oz character Simon Adebisi was picked by guitarist Larry Kaye when they needed a name quick. Not long after their formation, in July 2007, the band released their first ep titled "This is the EP of a band called Adebisi Shank". They released the ep on DIY label "Armed Ambitions" and this led to the band later in 2007 touring across continental Europe with Marvins Revolt. 
In early 2008 toured Japan, supporting LITE and the EP's release on their new Japanese label, "Parabolica".
In 2010 they were also nominated for a Choice Music Prize and played in Vicar Street in front of a sold out crowd. They lost to Two Door Cinema Club's debut album Tourist History.
For the release of their second album the band signed to US label and management company Sargent House, offering North American label support and worldwide management. This signing is significant for the band as they have always had a desire to tour the United States, however only wanted to do it if they could find a record label to support them. Prior to the release of their second studio album, in 2010, the band played a 14 date tour across Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including festival appearances at Indiependence, Castlepalooza, Off The Cuff and Glasgowbury. In 2011 the band won Best Album, Best Rock Act and Best Design at The Digital Socket Awards 2011, a music awards show organized by Irish music bloggers. 
In late 2012 Kaye revealed that he has formed a synth punk supergroup trio called "No Spill Blood". The band was formed with members from other bands like "Hands Up Who Wants To Die?", "Elk" and "Magic Pockets" and released their debut album on 31 July 2012. Across July 2012 the band engaged on a "New Tunez" tour which went across Ireland. This gave the band an opportunity to debut and perform new, unreleased material.
Characteristics.
Musical style.
Adebisi Shank have a style of music described as "seriously upbeat math-rocky craziness" and have self-described themselves as "robot-rock". Allmusic describes them as fusing "frenetic hardcore-influenced math rock with the epic scope of post-rock, the freewheeling intensity of heavy metal, and the dancefloor-shredding sensibilities of electronic dance music." Despite being an instrumental band the group uses distorted vocal effects in songs, treating their voices as if they are a part of their musical ensemble, with the band stating they would never use "clean vocals" in their music. The band incorporates several different instruments into their ensemble, utilising: guitars, drums, synthesizers, marimbas, horns, vocoder, percussion ensemble and "musical instruments we're not sure have even been invented yet."
The band's style has been compared to math rock bands such as Don Caballero and Battles, as well as also having their style compared to the "triumphant guitar harmonies of Fang Island with the mathematic precision of Battles, the genre-surfing playfulness of Daft Punk and churning intensity of Health." The bands influences are diverse, ranging through several different genres, including: Prince, Leonard Cohen, Radiohead, Oingo Boingo, Nirvana, Queen, Thin Lizzy, Paul Simon, Justice, Andrew WK, Jamie Lidell, Caribou, Vangelis, Steely Dan, Thomas Dolby, Arthur Russell, The Beach Boys, Smashing Pumpkins, Talking Heads, My Bloody Valentine, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Reich, Debussy, Tangerine Dream, OutKast, Lindsey Buckingham, Burt Bacharach, Le Butcherettes, The Brecker Brothers, R. Kelly, Eric Serra, Michael Jackson.
Live performances.
Adebisi Shank live performances have been described typically as relentless. A significant part of both the band's image and live performances is the bass player Vincent McCreith wearing a mask. The mask itself, which covers his entire face and resembles a scarf. When asked in an interview about the purpose of the mask McCreith commented saying: "I’d hate for the band to become famous purely because of the bass players rugged good looks and deep blue eyes."

Timbaland Thursdays is a weekly free music started by producer Timbaland. It was inspired by Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Fridays. In an interview with Rap-Up.com Timbaland stated “So my brother (Sebastian) told me Kanye is puttin' out a new song every Friday called G.O.O.D. Fridays, Swizz got Mondays,” who recently joined Twitter. “I don't know if they are on Twitter but can you hit them up, and tell them reserve that Thursday for Timbo the king baby. We’ll call it Timbo Thursday, cool?”.
Every Thursday, beginning on January 13, 2011, Timbaland planned on releasing a new song available for free download on a specially created website managed by Brian Byrd. All of the tracks come with their own album art.
In the wake of Timbaland Thursdays, Timbaland released a number of unreleased songs via YouTube in a build up to Timbaland Thursdays officially starting.
On the website 2 other songs were mentioned, ""Warped"" and ""Covers Blown"." 
A snippet of "Warped" was released on the site as a track for "Shock Value III" featuring Timbaland, Missy Elliott, Magoo & Sebastian, but was soon changed and put onto "Block Party". 
Covers Blown was originally thought to only feature Keri Hilson but on the site it is revealed that it also features Attitude & Sebastian and was originally slated for the initial “Timbaland Presents Shock Value” album, and may possibly be put onto the next album. One year later however, a demo version excluding Sebastian leaked.
Timbaland Thursdays will go on until the release of his upcoming album, "Timbaland Presents Shock Value III".

Béla von Kehrling

Béla von Kehrling (; ; 25 January 1891 – 16 April 1937) was a Hungarian tennis, table tennis, and football player but eventually a winter sportsman familiar with ice-hockey and occasionally competing in bobsleigh. He competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics and the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Just like Fred Perry, he played both tennis and table tennis professionally. In 1926 he played in the first table tennis World Cup final in London with Zoltán Mechlovits in doubles but lost to Roland Jacobi (who won the singles title) and Dániel Pécsi. He was also featured in the Hungarian team that won gold in team competition. Originally he wasn't part of the national team. While the Hungarians unanimously swept all of the medals after Roland Jacobi's singles and doubles success he suddenly been reported of the death of his father thus he decided to travel home. The substitute player was Béla von Kehrling who had to beat Munio Pillinger of Austria to have the team medal as well. He did so and completed the flawless victory for Hungary. In the end he took two medals in the table tennis world championships, one gold and one silver.
In 1924 he won the German Tennis Championships (now called German Open Hamburg). The following year he was back in the finals but then lost against Otto Froitzheim. The same year he won Hungarian tennis Championships (which he did 13 times altogether counting only the singles). In July 1933 Von Kehrling won the doubles and mixed doubles title at the Dutch Championships.
"Züricher Sport" newspaper ranked Kehrling as No. 10 in the European Top 10 rankings in 1931.
In conjunction with his sports activity he was the vice-president of the Hungarian Tennis Association and the editor-in-chief of its official magazine the bimonthly "Tennis and Golf".
Personal life.
Béla Kehrling married Magda Schlauch. She occasionally played tennis as well and wrote articles to the newspaper published by her husband. They had one son named Béla Kehrling, Jr, born in 1917 in Budapest who served as an Ensign in the cavalry brigade of the Hungarian Army in 1944. They had another son named Tamás who was born in 1924 and died in 1999.

<doc id="31056963" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31056963" title="Bone remodeling period">
Bone remodeling period

In bone physiology, the bone remodeling period describes the temporal duration (i.e. lifespan) of the basic multicellular unit (BMU) that is responsible for bone turnover. Historically, this was referred to as the sigma (σ) or sigma period, but the terminology is now outdated.
Bone remodeling.
Although bone may appear superficially as a static tissue, it is actually very dynamic, undergoing constant remodeling throughout the life of the vertebrate organism. This occurs with the synchronized action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, cells that resorb and deposit bone, respectively. Bone remodeling also occurs in response to trauma, such as that following accidental bone fracture or the placement of dental implants into the jaw bones.
The remodeling period.
The remodeling period consists of the combined duration of the resorption, the osteoclastic reversal (the phase marked by shifting of resorption processes into formative processes) and the formation periods of bone growth and development. This period refers to the average total duration of a single cycle of bone remodeling at any point on a bone surface.
For the remodeling to occur, appropriate cell signaling occurs to trigger osteoclasts to resorb the surface of the bone, followed by deposition of bone by osteoblasts. Together, the cells in any given particular region of the bone surface that are responsible for bone remodeling are known as the basic multicellular unit (BMU), and it is the average lifespan of the BMU that is referred to as the "remodeling period". The size of a BMU is roughly 200μm in diameter, defined by the 100μm diffusion capability in bone.
Determining the bone remodeling period.
In calculating the bone remodeling period, a two-dimensional model is examined, referring to the time it takes for the area in question to be eroded and then filled in with new bone (sigma will be used here for simplicity's sake). The bone formation portion (σf) of the bone remodeling period is calculated as follows:
in which MWT refers to the mean wall thickness of the completed bone unit and Mf refers to the prevailing mean effective bone appositional rate. In other words, what this formula means is that the bone remodeling period is equivalent to the thickness of the microscopic segment of bone being formed divided by the rate at which it forms. If the mean linear rate of bone resorption is known, the bone resorption portion (σr) can be similarly calculated:
Consequently, the entire bone remodeling period (σr + f, equivalent to σ) can be represented by the following formula:
The linear bone resorption rate (Mr) cannot be measured directly, but it approximates a third of σf.
Interspecies differences.
Each vertebrate species exhibits a distinct duration of bone regeneration and remodeling, and it appears as though there is an inversely proportional relationship between the rate of bone regeneration and the phylogenetic evolution of the animal. Each remodeling period lasts 3–6 months in humans, 3 months in dogs, and 6 weeks in rabbits.

<doc id="31056965" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31056965" title="Limigantes">
Limigantes

The Limigantes were a subject population, or under-class, of the Iazyges, a Sarmatian people who occupied the Hungarian Plain (East of the river Danube) during the Roman imperial era (1st to 4th centuries AD). They are attested in the "History" of the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, published ca. AD 390.
Ethnicity.
The Limigantes are described as "Sarmatae servi" ("Sarmatian slaves/serfs"), as opposed to the "Sarmatae liberi" ("free Sarmatians") by Ammianus. It is unclear whether the Limigantes were simply an under-class of ethnic Sarmatians or a non-Sarmatian subject people.
Conflict with Rome.
In AD 357, the Roman emperor Constantius II (ruled 337-61) faced a large force of Limigantes, who had successfully rebelled against their Iazyges overlords and then launched an invasion of Roman territory on the South bank of the Danube. The barbarians entered the empire near the confluence of the rivers Danube and Tisza, invading the province of Moesia Superior (roughly mod. Serbia). In a hard-fought battle, the Romans routed the Limigantes, slaughtering a large number. After this, the remaining Limigantes surrendered and were assigned lands to settle in beyond the imperial border, but which were apparently under Roman control (possibly seized from the "free Sarmatians" separately defeated earlier in the same year).
In 358, the Limigantes broke the terms of their treaty with Constantius and raided outside the territory assigned to them the previous year.

The Blue Economy

The Blue Economy: 10 years - 100 innovations - 100 million jobs is a book by Gunter Pauli. The book expresses the ultimate aim that a Blue Economy business model will shift society from scarcity to abundance "with what we have", by tackling issues that cause environmental and related problems in new ways. The book highlights potential benefits in connecting and combining seemingly disparate environmental problems with open-source scientific solutions based upon physical processes common in the natural world, to create solutions that are both environmentally beneficial and which have financial and wider social benefits. The book suggests that we can alter the way in which we run our industrial processes and tackle resultant environmental problems, refocusing from the use of rare and high-energy cost resources to instead seek solutions based upon simpler and cleaner technologies. The book aims to inspire entrepreneurs to adopt its insights, by demonstrating ways in which this can create economic benefits via job creation, reduced energy use, and more revenue streams from each step of the process, at the same time benefiting the communities involved. 'The Blue Economy' is presented in 14 chapters, each of which investigates an aspect of the world's economies and offers a series of innovations capable of making aspects of those economies sustainable.
Background.
The book was written by Gunter Pauli as Founder and Director of Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives. Pauli cites 15 years of experiences and over 50 successful projects all over the world as the basis for the ideas presented in his book.
The Blue Economy began as a project to find 100 of the best nature-inspired technologies that could affect the economies of the world, while sustainably providing basic human needs - potable water, food, jobs, and habitable shelter. Starting with 2,231 peer review articles Dr. Pauli and his team found 340 innovations that could be bundled into systems that function the way ecosystems do. These were then additionally reviewed by a group of corporate strategists, expert financiers, and public policy makers. Further meetings with entrepreneurs, financial analysts, business reporters, and corporate strategy academics reduced the list to one hundred. These are listed in an appendix of The Blue Economy.

The district was named after the city of Hambantota in Hambantota District, Southern Province. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Hambantota electoral district was replaced by the Hambantota multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Hambantota continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

The Institute of Economic Affairs, Ghana

The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Ghana, is a public policy think tank based in Accra, Ghana. It was founded by a Ghanaian economist, Dr. Charles Mensa in 1989 at a time when the country was governed by a military regime (Ghana was governed by the Provisional National Defence Council). The IEA was set up as an independent, non-government institution dedicated to the establishment and strengthening of a market economy and a democratic, fee and open society. The IEA supports research and promotes and publishes studies on economic, socio-political and legal issues in order to enhance understanding of public policy. 
The current Executive Director of the IEA is Mrs. Jean Mensa.
Objectives.
• providing a forum/platform for the exchange of ideas
• promoting research and publication of economic, socio-political and legal issues in order to enhance the understanding of public policy
• strengthening local capacity in Ghana by providing training to institutions of democracy such as Parliament, the Judiciary, the Media and civil society
• demonstrating the power of both profit and non-profit private institutions
• promoting the use of economic reasoning and understand the world of scarcity, choice and trade offs
• monitoring and providing an in depth analysis on the progress of democratic consolidation in Ghana and in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Work.
Research work at the IEA is undertaken through its two centres: The Economics Centre and The Governance Centre. This work includes in-house research in the areas of economics and governance, commissioned research, the production of a refereed policy journal called the Ghana Policy Journal and review of research and policy-related papers for external organizations.
In addition to its research agenda, the IEA also undertakes direct work to promote sustainable democracy in Ghana. For the 1996 presidential election, the IEA established a coalition of Civil Society Organisations (NADEO) to monitor the election. The IEA has played a role in monitoring every major election since then.
The IEA has also assisted the Parliament of Ghana in carrying out its functions, training legislative research assistants in 1996 to work in Parliament. In the year 2000, the IEA also organised the first ever Presidential debate in Ghana with the debates being held every election year since. In 2008, Vice-Presidential debates were included for the first time.
In 2004, the IEA also facilitated the formation of a Political Parties Code of Conduct and the setting up of a National Enforcement Body to regulate the code. Eight political parties ultimately signed the code. 
The IEA has also played a role in developing and encouraging the enactment of legislation. In 2003, the Ghanaian Cabinet approved two bills originating from the IEA. These were the Whistle Blowers Bill and the Right to Information Bill. The Whistle Blowers Bill was passed into law in 2008 by Parliament. 
Through the IEA’s Ghana Political Parties Programme the IEA has also brought the major political parties together to consider other IEA drafted legislation. These have included the Public Funding of Political Parties Bill, the Political Parties Bill and more recently the Presidential Transition Bill. The IEA’s role in facilitating bipartisan cooperation on these Bills was recognised in the inaugural State of the Nation Address by President John Atta Mills on February 19, 2009. The President stated that: 
"Madam Speaker,
Several areas of our governance agenda require legislative intervention. Fortunately, The IEA-sponsored 'Ghana Political Parties Programme' which is made up of all the political parties with representation in Parliament has agreed on several draft Bills that will respond to this need. Consequently, the Government will consider these draft Bills for possible Parliamentary enactment in order to fill the void. The Bills are:

The IEA has collaborated with several foundations and development agencies, including: 
• Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD) 
• The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
• The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) 
• The Danish Government, through The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) 
• The Royal Netherlands Embassy

Joshua Fawcett

Joshua Fawcett (9 May 1809, Bradford, Yorkshire - 21 December 1864) was an English clergyman and miscellaneous writer.
Life.
Fawcett was the second son of Richard Fawcett, worsted manufacturer, of Bradford, Yorkshire. He was educated at a grammar school at Clapham, London, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and took the degrees in arts, B.A. in 1829, M.A. in 1836. He was ordained in 1830, and after serving curacies at Pannall, near Harrogate, Yorkshire, and at Everton, near Liverpool, Lancashire, he was presented in 1833 by his brother-in-law, Henry Heap, vicar of Bradford, to the perpetual curacy of Holy Trinity, Wibsey, Low Moor. Fawcett as clergyman was an advocate of total abstinence, and a popular lecturer.
During his incumbency he built a new church, opened in 1837, and a parsonage. As the population of Low Moor and its immediate neighbourhood multiplied, five additional churches were erected. In 1860 he became honorary canon of Ripon Cathedral, Yorkshire, and chaplain to the bishop. He died suddenly at Low Moor 21 December 1864, and was buried on the 28th in Holy Trinity churchyard. In 1834 he married Sarah, third daughter of the Rev. Lamplugh Hird. His widow and two sons survived him.
Works.
His writings include:
He also edited ‘The Village Churchman,’ afterwards incorporated with ‘The Churchman,’ and continued under the title of ‘The Churchman's Magazine,’ 8 vols. London, 1838–45.

Tennessee Lady Volunteers softball

The Tennessee Lady Volunteers softball team represents the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee in NCAA women's softball competition. Coached by husband and wife Ralph and Karen Weekly, the team has become a consistently top tier team in the Southeastern Conference.
The team is more frequently referred to as the Lady Vols; the formal "Volunteers" nickname is regularly shortened by many fans of both men's and women's teams to "Vols", and sports media in the U.S. more commonly refer to Tennessee women's teams by the shortened version. The university considers either "Lady Volunteers" or "Lady Vols" acceptable.
Overview.
The Lady Vols first fielded a softball team in 1996 with Jim Beitia as head coach. In 2002, Tennessee brought in the husband and wife team of Ralph and Karen Weekly as co-head coaches. Since 2004, the team has reached the NCAA Tournament every year and the Women's College World Series five times. In 2007 the Lady Vols managed to make history and set the benchmark by which all future Lady Vol teams will be compared as the squad finished 63-8 for the programs best winning percentage of .887. A third-straight trip to the WCWS ended with Tennessee becoming the first Southeastern Conference program to reach the best-of-three NCAA Championship Series, before falling to champion Arizona. That year the team managed two wins over No. 4 Arizona and triumphs against No. 6 Northwestern and No. 7 Texas A&M which led to Tennessee spending a record 11 consecutive weeks at No. 1 in the ESPN.com/USA Softball poll, becoming the first SEC school to reach the lofty top ranking in the league's softball history.
Sherri Parker Lee Stadium.
The Sherri Parker Lee Stadium is the home venue for the Lady Vols. Opened in 2008, the stadium can seat 1,614 spectators as well as three press boxes, four VIP suites and an observation deck for television crews. In addition to Tennessee home games, Lee Stadium has hosted the SEC Softball Tournament (in 2009) and exhibition games involving the US national team (2008) and the Dutch national team (2011).
Situated next to the stadium, the Lady Vols clubhouse is approximately and features a team room, whirlpools, training area and conference room. Its other amenities include a kitchen, 30-seat theater, trophy room and a recreation room with a big-screen television, pool table, video games and comfortable furniture for the student-athletes. The locker room is also equipped with full laundry facilities, a mud room, 24 large lockers, shower and bathroom facilities. Also next to the clubhouse is one of the largest batting cage facilities in the nation. It contains four 16-by- cages which are designed to provide plenty of room to walk or film between each. All four cages are covered from the weather and possess high-quality Astroturf.
In 2011 the field was recognized as the NFCA/Stabilizer Solutions Field of the Year.
Head coaches.
Since Ralph and Karen Weekly have taken over for the Lady Vols they have guided the program from a team struggling to make a name for themselves in the SEC to a team that has garnered world recognition for their success. The National Fastpitch Coaches Association (NFCA) has chosen to honor Ralph for his efforts throughout a distinguished, three-decade career, that has spanned from his time in the U.S. Air Force through stops at Pacific Lutheran, Chattanooga and now Tennessee, with a 2011 induction into the NFCA Hall of Fame. Voted in by his coaching peers and with the organization consisting of just 49 previous inclusions, Weekly will join Ithaca Head Coach Deb Pallozzi in ceremonies to be held at the annual NFCA Convention. Ralph and Karen have managed to take the Lady Vols to their first Southeastern Conference regular season and tournament championships as well as the team's first Women's College World Series appearance. Their over-all record at Tennessee is 465-150-2 and they have recorded the programs most wins in a season with 67, a then national record in the NCAA. Ralph and Karen have also authored a book, "High-Scoring Softball."
All-Americans.
The Tennessee Volunteers softball program has garnered 25 Louisville Slugger/NFCA All-American honors.

Harold Frank

Harold Frank (1921–1995) was an American abstract expressionist artist, born in Southampton, England.
Life and career.
Born in England in 1917, Harold Frank and his family immigrated to the United States via Ellis Island. He was brought up in the tenements of New York and showed a talent for drawing when young. Feeling the angst of the great depression and World War II, his search for answers to the meaning of life lead him to take up abstract expressionism:
After some time in the US Army, he traveled to Paris to study and returned to New York in the 1950s. He attended the New York Art Students League, the National Academy of Design, Pratt Institute, Chouinard Art Institute, and UCLA, where he was a colleague of Richard Diebenkorn, who had a lasting influence on his work. Other artists who deeply affected his creative philosophy included De Kooning, Matisse, Picasso, and Rouault.
His one-man and group exhibition record is extensive and he was shown internationally in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Aubonne, Switzerland, as well as throughout the United States from the 1960s through to the 1980s. Though he did not seek recognition as his reason to create, major awards also came his way (among them the Adolph and Clara Obrig Award and the Sudam Silver Medal from the National Academy of Design; the National Watercolor Society's Grumbacher Award; the John Marin Memorial Award in the Watercolor U.S.A. Show and a First Prize from the Laguna Beach Museum of Art.
His subject matter included pure abstracts, landscapes, still lifes and the male and female head and figure. As many artists have done before and after him, he explored variations of each subject, experimenting with changes in medium, technique, light and color. His remarkable paintings of the female head and form quickly developed into a vehicle for his abstract interpretations. Though his brushwork is quick and sure, he often labored over several pieces at the same time.
His colors are vibrant and extraordinary. Rooted in the creative freedom of the Fauvists, it is applied with a craftsman's confidence and expertise.
He led a reclusive and introspective life, yet when asked, he communicated his creative experience with eloquence:
Harold Frank died in Los Angeles, California, USA, in 1995.
Education.
According to the Social Security Death Index found on Ancestry.com, Harold Frank was born in Poland on April 21, 1917 (not 1921).
