Koide Ichijūrō

Koide Ichijūrō (湖出市十郎, died 29 October 1800) was a Japanese kabuki composer-performer (唄方 "uta-kata") of "long songs" (長唄 "naga uta") of the Edo period. He was at first a student of Yoshizumi Kosaburo 1st (1699-1753) and identified himself as Yoshizumi Ichijuro. From 1747 he appeared at the Morita-za, one of the three venues of Edo. Afterwards he became a disciple of Fujita Yoshiji 1st (1714-1771）, and changed his own stagename to Fujita Okada. In 1768 he took the name Koide, and in opposition to Fujita Yoshiji's monopoly on the Ichimura-za, became active at the Nakamura-za, together with Nakamura Fujiro 1st (1719–86), receiving recognition also in Osaka. During the Meiwa-Tenmei period (1764–89) when the "meriyasu" genre of solo songs was in vogue he received recognition for "shirotae" (白妙, "white cloth cherry") and the "kouta" song "kurokami" ("black hair"). The name Ichijūrō was taken up by 2nd, 3rd, (and according to one tradition a 4th) generation of performers of his songs.

Øistein Saksvik

Øistein Saksvik (7 January 1925 – 10 November 1998) was a Norwegian long-distance runner. He specialized in the 5,000-metre and the 10,000-metre runs, as well as in cross-country running. At the 1952 Olympic Games, he competed in the 5,000-meter run. Saksvik became the Norwegian champion twenty times, a national record. In addition, he captured three Norwegian records in long-distance running from Martin Stokken, and held onto them for some years each. In the late-1950s, Saksvik's dominance in Norwegian long-distance running was eclipsed by Tor Torgersen and fellow Ranheim club member Ernst "Kruska" Larsen, later Thor Helland.
Athletic career.
Saksvik competed in several international championships. In his first, the Olympic 5000 metres in 1952, he did not progress from the heats. However, at the 1954 European Championships, he finished seventh in both 5000 and 10,000 metres. He later finished fourteenth in the 10,000 metres at the 1958 European Championships.
Saksvik is also known for winning twenty Norwegian championship titles in athletics, a Norwegian record which is tied with thrower Knut Hjeltnes. On the track he became Norwegian champion in the 5000 metres in 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1957, alternating mostly with cityfellows Martin Stokken and Ernst "Kruska" Larsen. He also won silver medals in this distance in 1949, 1951 and 1955. He won the 10,000 metres in 1953, 1954, 1956 and 1957. By winning his first gold medal, Saksvik ended the six-year dominance of Martin Stokken. However, in 1958 Saksvik only won the silver, behind club fellow Ernst "Kruska" Larsen.
Saksvik also set several Norwegian records. In the 3000 metres, he beat Martin Stokken's record in 1952 with the time 8:22.4, and broke his own record four times. His last record, 8:10.8 achieved at Bislett stadion in August 1955, stood for a year until overcome by Ernst "Kruska" Larsen. Saksvik is still the oldest record setter in the event. In the 5000 metres, he also broke Martin Stokken's record in 1952, improved it once, lost it to Stokken in 1954 and then regained it before the same thing happened with Ernst Larsen. Saksvik held his last record, 14:12.2 achieved at Bislett, from September 1955 and thirteen months until Larsen regained it. Lastly, he broke Stokken's 10,000 metre record in August 1952 in Copenhagen, a record which was only a week old. Saksvik improved it from 29:48.4 to 29:43.2 in September 1955 in Frankfurt an der Oder. It stood until 1959 when overcome by Tor Torgersen.
Saksvik also dominated Norwegian cross-country running in the early 1950s. His first medal was a silver in the cross-country forest course, achieved when he represented IL i BUL in 1949. He proceeded to win the race in 1953, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1960. He won the 3 kilometre cross-country championship in 1952, 1953 and 1955 with silver medals in 1950, 1957 and 1958, and the 8 kilometre event in 1956 and 1957 with a silver medal in 1951.
He represented the club Ranheim IL. His personal best times were 8:10.8 in the 3000 metres, 14:12.2 in the 5000 metres and 29:43.2 in the 10,000 metres. In middle distance races he had 3:54.6 in the 1500 metres. All these personal bests were set in 1955. Saksvik was also a good cross-country skier, winning a national championship gold medal in relay in 1953.

In My Life (Kevin Kern album)

In My Life is the fourth album from American New Age pianist Kevin Kern. As with his preceding and succeeding albums, it is an album of instrumental songs. It was released on August 24, 1999.
This is Kern's first album to feature compositions not written by him; prior to this, all of his album's songs were solely self-composed.
Inspirations.
This album marks the first time that Kern covered a song recorded by another artist, namely Elton John's "We All Fall in Love Sometimes" from his 1975 album "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy", and the Beatles' "In My Life" from their 1965 album "Rubber Soul". According to the liner notes of the album, while growing up, Kern and his brother would jam along to Beatles records as soon as they were released.
In addition to this, the song "Emerald Legacy", according to Kern, is inspired by his father's Irish tenor, which was also a part of his childhood. The song "To Sleep on Angels' Wings" is dedicated to his mother.
Track listing.
"All compositions by Kevin Kern, except where noted."
Liner Notes.
"In My Life", Real Music's fourth release from this well-loved pianist, offers a further palette of exquisite melodies played with Kern's graceful, accomplished touch. It also marks a departure into a new realm where Kern expands his dynamic range. Included on this album are two gorgeous arrangements of Elton John and Lennon/McCartney songs.
"In My Life" strikes a beautiful balance of songs to comfort the heart and uplift the spirit.

William Gush

William Gush (23 April 1813 - 28 February 1888) was an English portrait painter born near London. 
The "Dictionary of Victorian Painters" describes Gush’s style of painting as being in the keepsake tradition and that his female types are very similar to those of Charles Baxter. Kingsmead’s "A Dictionary of Artists 1760-1893" lists him as having exhibited 53 pictures at the Royal Academy, 4 at the British Institution and 2 at the Suffolk Street Galleries. He has numerous pieces in the National Portrait Gallery in London. There 354 known portraits painted by him.
Royal Academy.
In 1833 Gush’s first painting was accepted to be hung in the Royal Academy Exhibition staged at the National Gallery. The subject of this portrait was Sir John Harrison Yallop, late mayor of Norwich. The same year he was awarded the Gold Isis Medal by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturing and Commerce. In 1837, Gush had another portrait hung in the Royal Academy exhibition of the Duke of Beaufort, in the uniform of the Gloucester Yeomanry Cavalry.
Some of the eminent subjects commissioning William were Lieutenant Colonel Townsend of the 14th Royal Light Dragoons, whose portrait was exhibited in 1840 at the Royal Academy Exhibition, the Right Reverend James Henry Monk - Lord Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, painted for the Bishop’s College in Clifton exhibited in 1842, and the Earl of Bantry exhibited in 1844. In 1853, Gush’s exhibit at the Royal Academy exhibition was a portrait entitled "Mrs Mills". His last portrait to be exhibited at the Academy was in 1865 and depicted Mrs Philip Vanderbyl; his subsequent entries in 1867 and between 1872-4 had less specific titles such as "At Lessons and Blackberries". The Royal Academy moved from sharing the National Gallery’s premises in Trafalgar Square to the rebuilt Burlington House in 1869 and the artist’s final painting entitled "The New Song" (1874) brought to an end over forty years of exhibiting.
"Wesleyan Methodist Magazine".
In 1844 and 1845 William Gush contributed all the portraits of Methodist ministers, published in the "Wesleyan Methodist Magazine." By 1847 William bought a studio at the prestigious address No 17 Stratford Place, an exclusive cul-de-sac situated off Oxford Street, London.
His commitments back in England still kept him very busy, the main one of these being the provision of portraits for the "Wesleyan Methodist Magazine". He also painted other portraits including one depicting John Curwen, a composer, now held at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
In 1860 Gush had provided the portraits for all twelve issues of the "Methodist Magazine", just three years later the number was halved and the last engraving of a portrait by William Gush (of the Reverend Thomas T N Hull) appeared in February 1864. Photography now superseded portrait painting as a means of illustration, though the well-to-do would still wish to have their portraits painted to adorn the walls of their grand houses.
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
It was shortly after the end of the Crimean War that William Gush visited Nova Scotia for the first time. In 1858 Gush sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia on board the steamer "Niagara", leaving Liverpool on 14 August. He stayed in the region for about four months. During this time he painted several portraits of notable figures in the region.
The Board of Trustees of Mount Allison University at Sackville invited Gush to paint a full size portrait of Charles Frederick Allison, the founder of the University. Whilst in Sackville, William also painted portraits of Charles Allison’s wife and daughter and Reverend Humphrey Pickard, 1st President of the University and Methodist minister. He also did a painting of the Honourable William Botsford, a local magistrate.
He returned to Liverpool on the "Europa" on 20 December 1858. After his return, in the early 1860s the celebrated Nova Scotian military officer Sir John Inglis, a military gentleman whose career is remembered for his heroic defense of the residency at Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny in 1858, commissioned Gush to paint his portrait. In 1864 William’s portrait of Sir John Inglis (who was by now deceased) was included in the Royal Academy’s Exhibition, after which the painting was transported to Halifax, Nova Scotia from where the commission had originated. It is now hung in Province House. A further portrait of Reverend John Beecham, the first president of the Wesleyan Conference of Eastern British America was completed by Gush on his return to England.
William Gush died on 28 February 1888 at Old Malden, England. His body was buried alongside that of his wife in the graveyard at St John the Baptist Church, Malden on 3 March 1888.

Stražišče, Kranj

Stražišče () is a former settlement in the Municipality of Kranj in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. It is now part of the city of Kranj. It includes the hamlet of Gaštej ().
Name.
The name "Stražišče", like similar names (e.g., "Straža", "Straže", "Stražica", etc.) is derived from the Slovene common noun "straža" 'guards' or 'guard post'. Such names are often applied to settlements near hills or mountains where warning fires were lit to warn against Ottoman attacks. Such Slovene names are often paralleled by German names containing the root "Wart(e)" 'guard, watch'; in this case, Wartenburg Castle stood on a cliff below neighboring Šmarjetna Gora. In the 19th century the German name was "Straschische".
History.
Stražišče was deeded to Freising Bishop Gottschalk in 1002 by Emperor Henry II. In 1291 it came under Bavarian control and had 17 farms. Stražišče was known for sieve-making in the 16th century; sieves from the village were exported to Italy, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Greece, and other destinations, and the horsehair for their manufacture was imported from as far away as France, Russia, Wallachia, and Serbia. Industrialization of sieve-making and also linen production was carried out in the 18th century. Stražišče was annexed by the city of Kranj in 1957, ending its existence as a separate settlement.
Churches.
The chapel of ease in Stražišče dedicated to Saint Bartholomew () was first mentioned in a visitation record in 1631. It was remodeled several times. The bell tower dates from 1734 and the church contains paintings from 1865 by Janez Wolf (1825–1884). The parish church is dedicated to Saint Martin. The original parish church stood next to the Sava River near the current railroad station, along the old Roman road, and was built during an epidemic. It was razed and replaced by the current church in 1735. The church features a Gothic Pietà and Baroque furnishings by Valentin Metzinger, Leopold Layer, Jožef Egartner, Matevž Langus, and Michael Stroy. Saint Martin's Parish was established very early; a parish priest named Arnold was mentioned in 1163, and Filip in 1248.

Professional Development League

The Professional Development League is a system of youth football leagues that are managed, organised and controlled by the Premier League or by the Football League. It was introduced by the Football Association via the Elite Player Performance Plan in 2012.
The system was introduced in early 2012 and was active for the first time during the 2012-13 season. It is a successor to the Premier Reserve League, Premier Academy League and Football Combination. The Football League Youth Alliance makes up League 3 of the under 18 system. The system covers the under-18 and under-21 age groups.
Previously, clubs participating in the Premier Reserve League (the highest level of reserve football in England) were removed from the competition if their first team in the Premier League were relegated and replaced with a promoted team. Under the Professional Development League system, Premier League reserves teams' league status is not directly linked to the first team's Premier League status. Instead, there are three different Professional Development Leagues at each age-group level and clubs in the top four tiers of the English football league system are placed in the system based on the assessment of their academy for the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP).
U21 level.
The U21 age-range was set up for the first time with the introduction of the Professional Development League. Teams are allowed to field three overage outfield players and one overage goalkeeper. League 3 clubs voted against introducing an U21 league, the northern based sides instead choosing to continue fielding reserve sides in the Central League.
League 1.
Champions.
From 2012/13 to 2013/14, the champions of League 1 were the team who won the knockout stage final. 
From 2014-15, the champions of League 1 will be the team who finish 1st in Division 1.
League 2.
Champions.
The overall League 2 champions are the team who win the knock-out stage at the end of the season.
U18 level.
The Professional Development U18 Leagues 1 and 2 replace the Premier Academy League, with League 3 still being run under the auspices of the Football League Youth Alliance.

Triratna Man Tuladhar

Triratna Man Tuladhar (Devanagari: त्रिरत्न मान तुलाधर) (1905-1986) was one of the largest Nepalese traders in traditional Tibet and the president of the Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa in the 1940s.
Early life.
Triratna Man (alternative name: Lhandur) was born at Nyata, Kathmandu, the eldest of the three sons of trader and philanthropist Dharma Man Tuladhar and mother Hera Lani Tuladhar. He was educated at home, and taught himself English and Chinese. He learned Tibetan and Hindi during his stay in Tibet and India. In 1913, he was married to Punya Maya Kansakar.
Triratna Man was also an activist in the movement to revive Theravada Buddhism in Nepal; and in 1924, became a member of the Buddhist Relief Association founded by Buddhist scholar and leader Dharmaditya Dharmacharya.
Business in Tibet.
Triratna Man belonged to a long line of Lhasa Newar merchants. His family owned a business house in Lhasa known as Chhusingsyar which has a history dating from 1790 AD. The firm conducted trade between Nepal, India and Tibet. Its main business was musk, brocade, gems, textiles and general merchandise. Besides its main shop in Lhasa, the firm maintained shops in Gyantse and Phari in Tibet, and in Kalimpong, Kolkata and Ladakh in India. The firm in Kolkata was known as Dharma Man Purna Man - Tibetan Musk Depot. 
Triratna Man went to Lhasa for the first time in 1928 and managed the family business. He returned to Nepal in 1929. He made two more trips to Lhasa, and lived there from 1935-1941 and from 1947-1953, spending a total of 13 years in Tibet. 
In 1947, Triratna Man became president of the Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa and held the post for a year.
After he returned to Nepal leaving the business in the care of his sons, he was elected to the executive committee of the Kathmandu Chapter of the association in 1955. He sat on the committee until 1957. 
His eldest son Pratek Man Tuladhar wound up the business house of Chhusingsyar and returned to Nepal in 1960. The traditional Tibet trade came to an end following the Sino-Indian War of 1962 when the trade route through Sikkim was shut down. Triratna Man then settled down to a quiet life in Kathmandu.

Unlike Kern's past albums, this album breaks away from his other in the way that it is recorded solely on the piano; as such, there are no other instruments whatsoever on the album. In addition to this, these songs are re-recorded versions of past Kern compositions that appeared on his previous albums; none of the songs here are new.
None of the songs from "In My Life" (1999), "The Winding Path" (2003), or "Endless Blue Sky" (2009) were re-recorded for this album.

Over the years, you, my fans, have told me your stories about how my music has become a part of your lives. From the young aspiring pianist learning to play "Through the Arbor," to the bride walking down the aisle to "Sundial Dreams", or to the cancer survivor who drew strength from listening to "A Gentle Whisper" while enduring chemotherapy, each of your stories has profoundly touched and inspired me. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the impact my music would have on so many people around the world. I want you to know that I am deeply humbled and thankful for what you have brought to my life. 
So this is my gift to each of you, a collection of the special songs you have loved best - on the instrument I love most.

Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride

Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride is a 1940 American Western film directed by Frank McDonald and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, and June Storey. Written by Winston Miller, based on a story by Betty Burbridge and Connie Lee, the film is about a singing cowboy who inherits a meat-packing plant and must face stiff competition from a beautiful business rival.
Plot.
Singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) work on a ranch owned by Ann Randolph (June Storey). Gene is unaware that he has just inherited the Belmont Packing Company. While Gene and Frog take the cattle to market, Gene has an argument with Ann who fires them both, giving them one of the steers as back pay. Later the local sheriff, seeing a Randolph steer in the possession of the two cowboys, arrests Gene and Frog on suspicion of cattle rustling. Attorney Henry Walker (Forbes Murray), who has been searching for the singing cowboy, finally locates Gene at the jail and informs him of his inheritance.
After being released from jail, Gene takes possession of the Belmont Packing Company. Ann, who owns a rival packing company, had plans to merge the two companies under her ownership. Now she is dismayed to learn that the man she just fired is now her main business competitor. Ann's conniving general manager and fiancé, Donald Gregory (Warren Hull), convinces her to feign romantic interest in Gene and sweet talk him into selling his company to her. At first the plan appears to work, and Gene agrees to Ann's offer and signs a contract of sale. Later, when he learns that Gregory plans to close the plant putting all his employees out of work, Gene tears up the contract and decides to stay in the packing business.
Gene soon learns that his biggest business challenge is having enough cattle to fill the distribution demands. He initiates a campaign to convince the ranchers to sell their stock to his Belmont Packing Company, and soon the contracts start coming in. Ann responds with her own campaign, however, appealing to ranchers with a "helpless woman" routine. When he notices her success, Gene changes tactics and starts a new campaign, singing to the ranchers and organizing parades in an effort to win their business, and the campaign succeeds.
Unable to compete with legitimate business approaches, Gregory orders his men to use violence to stop the singing cowboy. Ann's little sister Patsy (Mary Lee), who has a crush on Gene, overhears Gregory's men plotting to dynamite the dam and flood the valley. After she warns Gene of Gregory's scheme, Gene rides off and intercepts Gregory's henchmen before they can plant their explosives. Soon after, Gregory is indicted for sabotage, and Gene and Ann form a business alliance as well as a romantic relationship.

Gaius Vettius Gratus Sabinianus

Gaius Vettius Gratus Sabinianus (c. 180 – c. 225) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 221.
Biography.
A member of the Gens Vetti, Gratus Sabinianus was probably the grandson of Gaius Vettius Sabinianus Julius Hospes who was the suffect consul in around AD 176. Presumably a recently established Patrician, he began his career in the military, serving as the "sevir equitum Romanorum" (or commander) of the 3rd "Turmae". He was then probably promoted to the rank of Military tribune of the Legio VII Claudia. With the emperor’s consent, he turned his eye to a political career. He may have been selected as an imperial candidate for the office of Quaestor, followed by his nomination for the office of "Praetor tutelarius", responsible for matters pertaining to guardianships.
Gratus Sabinianus’ next appointment was as the curator of the Via Flaminia, and included responsibility for the supply of food into Rome. He was then elected as "consul prior" alongside Marcus Flavius Vitellius Seleucus in AD 221. It is speculated that Gratus Sabinianus died shortly after his consulship.
Gratus Sabinianus had at least one son, Gaius Vettius Gratus Atticus Sabinianus, who was elected consul in AD 242.

Tourist attractions in West Bengal

Tourist attractions in West Bengal refers to the tourist attractions in the Indian state of West Bengal. West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India and is the nation's fourth-most populous. It is also the seventh-most populous sub-national entity in the world, with over 91 million inhabitants. It is bordered by the countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, and the Indian states of Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim, and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata (formerly "Calcutta"). West Bengal encompasses two broad natural regions: the Gangetic Plain in the south and the sub-Himalayan and Himalayan area in the north.
During the British colonial era from 1700–1912, Kolkata (then known as "Calcutta") enjoyed the privilege of being the capital of British India and witnessed a spate of frenzied construction of buildings, largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and, to a much lesser extent, by the Portuguese and French.
Kolkata - now the state capital, is considered to be an ideal hub to cover all the destinations in West Bengal. The following is a list of some of the attractions of West Bengal:
West Bengal stretches to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The coastal strip of West Bengal, extending from the Gangetic Delta to the border of Orissa has some beautiful coastal settlements namely Digha, Shankarpur, Mandarmani, Bakkhali, Gangasagara, Tajpur and more others.
Tourist attractions also include some more geographical indications like Nakshi Kantha(Handicraft), Darjeeling tea (Agricultural), "Santipore" Saree (Handicraft), Shantiniketan Leather Goods (Handicraft), Fazli Mango (Agricultural), Khirsapati or "Himsagar" Mango (Agricultural), "Laxman Bhog Mango" (Agricultural), "Baluchari" Saree (Handicraft), and "Dhaniakhali" Saree (Handicraft).
Other attractions include the culture of West Bengal. It attracts tourist for pilgrimages to the holy places of different religions. People from different sections of the world come to West Bengal for holy pilgrimages as Kolkata is one of the four "adi" "Shaktipeethas". Among the other 52 "shaktipeethas" some are located in West Bengal. The notable Hindu temples include Kalighat Kali Temple, Tarapith, Belur Math, Mayapur ISKCON Temple, Hangseshwari Temple, Tarakeshwar Temple and Dakshineswar Kali Temple.
West Bengal also has countless mosques like the "Nizamat Imambara" and Katra Mosque in Murshidabad, Furfura Sharif and Tipu Sultan Shahi Mosque in Kolkata.
Other pilgrim destinations include "Gurdwaras" for Sikhs and churches like the The Basilica of the Holy Rosary in Bandel, St. John's Church, St. Jame's Church ("Jora Girja"), St. Paul's Cathedral and Church of the Lord Jesus.
Buddhist Monasteries in West Bengal are especially located in the hilly regions like the Ghoom Monastery, Bhutia Busty Monastery, Mag-Dhog Yolmowa Monastery, Tharpa Choling Monastery, Zang Dhok Palri Phodang and more others.
Notable festivals include Durga Puja in October is the most popular festival in the West Bengal. Poila Baishakh (the Bengali New Year), Rathayatra, Dolyatra or Basanta-Utsab, Nobanno, "Poush Parbon" (festival of Poush), Kali Puja, SaraswatiPuja, LaxmiPuja, Christmas, Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha and Muharram are other major festivals. Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, is one of the most important Hindu/Buddhist festivals while Christmas, called "Bôŗodin" (Great day) in Bengali is celebrated by the minority Christian population. Poush Mela is a popular festival of Shantiniketan, taking place in winter.
Being home to notable people like Rabindranath Tagore, Asia's first Nobel laureate and composer of India's national anthem and Swami Vivekananda, a key figure in introducing Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and USA
there houses and residencies like Shantiniketan and Jorasanko Thakur Bari are world famous and attract many tourists.
West Bengal also has a long tradition of popular literature, music and drama largely based on Bengali folklore and Hindu epics and Puranas.
Kolkata, the state capital city, was also the workplace of several social reformers, like Raja Ram Mohan Ray, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination or untouchability, the evils that crept into the Hindu society, were abolished.
 
West Bengal is also known to make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including "Rôshogolla", "Chômchôm", "Kalojam" and several kinds of "sondesh". Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread or dimsum are specialties of winter season. Sweets like coconut-naru, til-naru, moa, payesh, etc. are prepared during the festival of Lakshmi puja. Popular street food includes "Aloor Chop", Beguni, Kati roll, and phuchka.
The variety of fruits and vegetables that Bengal has to offer is incredible. West Bengal is also famous for its costumes.
NDTV along with the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India conducted a nationwide campaign for searching the ""Seven Wonders of India" in 2008-09. The campaign started with shortlisting 200 places from all of the Indian states and then inviting public to cast their vote for their favorite places.

Architecture of Maharashtra

This article discusses the famous Architecture of Maharashtra. Maharashtra, India is famous for its caves and rock cut architecture. It is said that the varieties found in Maharashtra are wider than the caves and rock-cut architecture found in the rock cut areas of Egypt, Assyria, Persia and Greece. The Buddhist monks first started these caves in the 2nd century BC, in search of serene and peaceful environment for meditation, and they found these caves on the hillsides.
Later, Hindu cave temples at Ellora and Ajanta became the finest designs of human art. Some of India's oldest wall paintings can be seen here. Maharashtra's famous rock-cut caves have several distinct design elements; even though sculptures of the time are regarded to be so stiff and unmoving. The Buddhist caves, particularly the older ones, are either temples (Chaityas) or monasteries (Viharas).
Ancient.
The oldest building in the state is Vakataka ruins in Mansar.
Rock cut caves.
Rock-cut architecture took turn with the Buddhist reign and remarkable Buddhist monuments were produced in areas such as Bihar in the east and Maharashtra in the west. Natural grottos and caves in the hillside were excavated by the Buddhist monks and turned into glorious prayer halls and monasteries.
Ranging from tiny monastic cells to colossal, elaborately carved temples, they are remarkable for having been hewn by hand from solid rock. Their 3rd century BC origins seem to have been as temporary shelters for Buddhist monks when heavy monsoon rains made their normal itinerant lifestyle impossible.
Modeled on earlier wooden structures, most were sponsored by merchants, for whom the casteless new faith offered an attractive alternative to the old, discriminatory social order. Gradually, encouraged by the example of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, the local ruling dynasties also began to embrace Buddhism. Under their patronage, during the 2nd century BC, the first large-scale monastery-caves were created at Karla, Bhaja and Ajanta.
Peoples view.
Standing as silent sentinels to history are the 350-odd forts of Maharashtra. Beaten by the sea waves, lashed at by the torrential Deccan rains, or scorched in the blazing sun, stand imposing ramparts and crumbling walls the last lingering memories of Maharashtra's martial times. Nowhere in the country would you encounter such a profusion and variety of forts. Sited on an island, as at Murud-Janjira or guarding the seas as at Bassein, or among the Sahyadri hills, as at Raigad, whose zig-zag walls and rounded bastions sit like a sceptre and crown amidst hills turned mauve.
Most of the forts in Maharashtra whether up in the hills or near the seas are associated with Shivaji—the great Maratha warrior and an equally great fort builder. Moreover, these forts were treated as mini-cities, such as Panhala, which is now a hill station. The concept of the fort-city was, however, not peculiar to Shivaji alone. The Portuguese who came to India as traders and missionaries, built within a century of their coming, Bassein, a garden city to rival many a European capital.
Today, these forts numbed by sun, sleet and British have not only been witness to changing times, but have also shaped them and within their walls throb the heart-beat of history."
Below are some aerials of Maratha forts, taken helicopter-borne by Uddhav Thackeray, showcased across the country. Pictures courtesy Amit Save.
Maratha.
Shivaji built Lal Mahal in Pune. He captured forts made by Muslims like Torna, Sinhagad, panhala, etc.
he also built many strong forts. like sindhudurga, raigargh, pratapgarh, lingana, etc.
Shaniwarwada is a palace fort in Pune . it was the seat of the "Peshwa" rulers of the Maratha Empire.

At the sixth attempt, Newcastle Gosforth the champions, were promoted to the Courage League National Division One for season 1993–94. Due to next seasons reduction of teams from thirteen to ten in the top two divisions, second placed Waterloo did not gain promotion and seven teams were relegated to Courage League National Division Three. They were Bedford, Rosslyn Park, Richmond, Blackheath, Coventry, Fylde and Morley. Rosslyn Park were relegated for the second successive season.
Participating teams.
Joining the nine teams who remained in the division from last season were Nottingham and Rosslyn Park who were both relegated from the top division. It was Nottingham's first season in the division and Rosslyn Park's second. Park's only other appearance was in the very first season when they were the champions. Both the promoted teams, Fylde and Richmond, were relegated back to the third tier.

Johann Veldener

Johann Veldener (born in Würzburg, died in Leuven between 1486 and 1496), also known as Jan Veldener or Johan Veldenaer; was an early printer in Flanders. He worked as a punchcutter and printer in Cologne, together with William Caxton, who may have financed his first books. They both left for Flanders in 1472. Evidence indicates that Veldener assisted Caxton in setting up his printing office in Bruges and helped printing his first work there, the 1472-1473 "Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye" by Raoul Lefèvre. Afterwards, Veldener went to Leuven and set up his printing company there, becoming the second printer in Leuven after John of Westphalia, and the third or fourth in the Netherlands. He entered the Leuven University on 30 July 1473 in the faculty of Medicine. 
He left Leuven in 1477, after the death of Charles the Bold caused unrest in the city, and went to Utrecht. When that city also became troubled, he left for Culemborg, and finally returned to Leuven in 1484.
Veldener was also known for creating typefaces, both for his own work and for others, and Caxton is believed to have taken one of Veldener's typefaces with him to England and used it among others on his first edition of the "Canterbury Tales". It is probable that he later bought a number of other typefaces from Veldener as well. 
While in Utrecht, Veldener also supposedly wrote a "Chronyck van Hollandt, Zeelandt, ende Westvrieslandt" (a "Chronicle of Holland, Sealand, and Western Friesland"), which was reprinted in 1650 in Utrecht. Other works attributed to him are the "Cronijcken van Enghelant" (a chronicle of the English kings until 1460), "Cronijcken van Utrecht" (a history of the Bishopric of Utrecht), "Cronijcken van Gelre", "Cronijcken van Cleve" and the "Cronijcken van Brabant". Currently it is believed that these works were anonymous and printed by him, and that the later attributions to him as writer are erroneous.

<doc id="36665111" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36665111" title="Death of Yehuda Shoham">
Death of Yehuda Shoham

The Death of Yehuda Shoham occurred after on 5 June 2001 Palestinian threw stones at a civilian vehicle, near the Israeli settlement of Eli in the West Bank, in which the five-month-old American-Israeli Yehuda Shoham was seated. The stones entered through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. Shoham eventually died of severe brain damage on 11 July 2001.
This stoning attack and Yehuda's six-day struggle for life made headlines in Israel. In a letter to the United Nations, Israel's permanent representative wrote of the incident as a "reprehensible act of terrorism", noting that it followed Israel's declaration that it would desist from military action against Palestinian targets, and that PLO leader Yasser Arafat had undertaken to stop violence and terrorism.
The attack.
The incident occurred as Benny and Batsheva Shoham and their only child Yehuda approached Eli after paying a shiva call in Ra'anana. 
Near Eli, Palestinians hiding at the roadside hurled rocks at the car which broke through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. The father continued driving, worried about an ambush, and at a nearby intersection, the couple noticed their baby's head injuries. Batsheva performed mouth to mouth resuscitation on Yehuda until the arrival of paramedics.
Yehuda was taken to an intensive care unit at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where he lay unconscious and with severe head injuries. He was attached to a respirator for nearly a week before dying of severe brain damage on July 11, as did an 18-year-old Palestinian security agent whose skull had been fractured by a rubber-coated Israeli bullet earlier on the same day Yehuda was wounded. 
During his time in the hospital, Yehuda's parents gave him a second name, "Chaim," which means life, hoping that he would live. While in the hospital, Yehuda was visited by then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
Background.
The Second Intifada, which began 8 months earlier, marked a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence. On May 22, Sharon declared a unilateral ceasefire and refrained from retaliating against Palestinian attacks. On Friday, June 1, a suicide bombing outside a Tel Aviv disco occurred which killed 21 people, mainly Israeli teenagers who had immigrated from Russia. The day after, Saturday, June 2, Yasser Arafat's call for a cease-fire staved off Israeli retaliation.
Aftermath.
In the meantime, Israel took a variety of measures to reduce tension, with Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer citing a "significant reduction in the number of attacks". Though Palestinians would be subject to strict closure confining them to their towns, Israel eased some travel restrictions and Palestinians were to be allowed to return from Jordan and Egypt, raw materials would be permitted to enter and exit the Palestinian territories, and Palestinians would be allowed to return to their jobs in an industrial zone near the Erez crossing point. Palestinian security commanders traveled to trouble spots in the Gaza Strip to consult with local officers over the cease-fire enforcement.
When news of Yehuda's wounding spread on Tuesday, June 5, Sharon began to be urged by far-right settlers to retaliate. The incident angered Israel's 200,000 settlers who urged Ariel Sharon to end Israel's "policy of restraint", and abandon the ceasefire. "The Independent" suggested that the incident would be cited by many Israelis as reason for stepping up military measures. The morning after Yehuda's wounding, at least 300 settlers, arriving in buses, assailed two villages adjacent to Shiloh, Assawiya, and Luban al-Sharkiya, which lay under curfew and within Israel's security responsibility, and, according to B'tselem, in the presence of, and according to local testimony, with the assistance of the IDF, fired a wheat harvest, a hothouse, a carpentry shop and a school, stole tools and shot a Palestinian youth in the stomach or the leg. There were rock-throwing battles between settlers and Palestinians at the site of the attack on the Shohams' car during which one Israeli and seven Palestinians were injured. In addition, settlers in Hebron also attacked local Palestinian shopkeepers. The settlers had been a focal target of Palestinian militancy during an eight-month uprising. Two settlers were arrested by Israeli police as a result of the riots.
Though reluctant to become involved in the conflict, the U.S. dispatched C.I.A. director George Tenet, who was scheduled to meet separately with the Israeli and Palestinian sides on Thursday, June 7, in order to re-establish co-operation on security issues between the two parties, which had broken down after the IDF had shot at the car of the Gaza Strip security chief Mohammad Dahlan in mid-April, and had fired on the home of their West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub in late May. Tenet's visit backed up an effort by the European Union to seize on Arafat's declaration in order to transform the ceasefire into a genuine halt to the reciprocal blood-letting. On Wednesday, June 6, the eve of Tenet's scheduled visit, the IDF announced it would award medals to the commanders and troops serving at Netzarim Junction, where the child, Mohammed al-Dura had been shot dead. The news was seen as a blow to the restoration of trust. Thousands of demonstrators protested in Jerusalem against what they termed Sharon's "restraint policy". That same evening, Palestinians were outraged when Sharon called Arafat a "murderer" and "pathological liar" in an interview addressing the Russian community that had been angered at his failure to retaliate for the disco bombing. The broadcast was carried on Israeli television. Though given the red-carpet treatment abroad, he added, Arafat did not act like a head of state but rather like the chief of terrorists and murderers. 
On Thursday, June 7, speaking to reporters at a rally urging Ariel Sharon to retaliate for the attack on Yehuda and other recent attacks, Yehuda's father said "Unfortunately, our government is showing a lot of weakness in its response to terrorism". He also declared:
This is our land, these are our roads, and if we are afraid of driving to Tel Aviv [Tel Aviv] and Netanya [Netanya] also.
Negotiations, Funeral and Reactions.
Tenet’s meeting with both sides was postponed until Sunday, June 10, after the Americans realized the extent of their differences. Matters were buffeted by the killing of three Bedouin women, struck by Israeli tank shells while in their tents in the Gaza Strip over the weekend, and the critical injuries sustained by an Islamic Jihad member in a car-bombing, which the group suspected as being the work of Israel. He proposed that Israel desist from attacking Palestinian targets and withdraw to the positions they held on September 28, 2000. He asked Palestinians to thwart attacks on Israeli positions, to end what Israelis view as incitement in the media, and to proceed to arrest militant gunmen.
On Monday, June 11, the day Yehuda died, the Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met the Palestinian minister for international co-operation, Nabil Shaath in Luxembourg to explore a compromise. Tenet eventually presided over a tense 4-hour meeting the following day, which was broken off after the gaps failed to be bridged. The Israelis insisted on the arrest of people they suspected of terrorism before they would allow a cooling-off period, while the Palestinians demanded that security arrangements be followed by an Israeli pledge to freeze to all construction in settlements in the occupied territories. The Palestinians refused to conduct what they called arbitrary arrests. The chief of staff of the Israeli army, General Shaul Mofaz, called the truce itself an optical illusion.
The funeral procession for Yehuda began with settlers gathering in front of Ariel Sharon's office in Jerusalem with the child's body carried before them. As Sharon stepped up to a podium to address them, settlers shouted "Vengeance!" and "Go to war". Prime Minister Sharon spoke to the funeral procession outside his office, and, acknowledging the settlers' impatience with a ceasefire, said:If we stand firm and grit our teeth, and carry on even when the tears are choking us, we will win... I am not here to make a speech, but to weep, to weep together with you. May the memory of Yehuda be blessed.
Sharon also asked for prayers for the infant, and condemned the Palestinian Authority for inciting violence.
From there the procession walked to the northern West Bank settlement of Shilo where Yehuda was buried. 
One of Yehuda's cousins said, "Yehuda was just a baby, without sin or enemy, yet he was killed for one reason only, he was a Jew on his way home in Eretz Yisrael [Eretz Yisrael]." In a letter to the United Nations, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Yehuda Lancry outlined Israel’s position, which affirmed that the death of Yehuda Shoham constituted a “reprehensible act of terrorism” that took place just over two weeks after Israel had declared that it would refrain from initiating military action against Palestinians, and barely a week after Yassir Arafat had undertaken to fight violence and terrorism.
In Yehuda's memory, his parents decided to collect donations for dormitories at the yeshiva in Shiloh. His parents also established the Yehuda Fund in January 2002 "in their son's memory."

On September 4, 2008, La Ruffa debuted for Wrestling Stars, France's top promotion and one of the longest running in all of Europe. La Ruffa enjoyed most of his recent success there, and established himself as one of Europe's top talent while fighting against the continent's best competitors and making a name for himself through YouTube videos. While in WS, he took on a Greek warrior gimmick, to pay tribute to his family roots. While in WS Tom was taken under the wings of famous French pro wrestlers : Flesh Gordon, Prince Zefy and Monsieur Jacky and headlined shows all over his native country, often wrestling three shows per week end, 2 matches per nights.

His WS career has been featured in many press articles and TV appearances. One of the most notable was a documentary on his life couple with the daughter of WS top star and 40 years veteran of French rings Flesh Gordon : Lili Gordon for NT1's Tous Differents TV show. The featurette, aired nationally on prime time French TV, ran for half an hour and showed how Tom and Lili (WS ring announcer at the time) were dealing with distances in their couple (he lived in Nice, and she was in Paris), how wrestling played in their life especially with Tom's upcoming opportunity at France's national Catch Championship, and whether their love could outlive all these issues. It didn't, as Tom pursued his dream, and Lili started to go to an acting school.

A reality documentary television series, in which Lance Storm would train 10 former students to help them make it to the next level. La Ruffa portrayed the "French Stallion" character in what many consider a show stealing performance, as he appeared to be the most arrogant, obnoxious, and attention-seeking jerk ever. The series was filmed in December 2010 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and began airing in May 2011.
World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE.
NXT (2012-present).
In November 2011, La Ruffa wrestled a single appearance on "Smackdown" as a local wrestler who along with two others wrestlers Andy Baker and Zak Zodiac and lost a handicap match against Big Show. In August 2012, WWE signed La Ruffa to a developmental contract. In WWE's developmental territory NXT Wrestling, La Ruffa took up the ring name Sylvester Lefort, and his NXT television debut took place on the May 29, 2013 episode of "NXT," where he (as a rich Frenchman) managed the tag team of Garrett Dylan and Scott Dawson (two Southerners) in a win over Travis Tyler and Baron Corbin. After Dylan and Dawson lost a number one contender match for the NXT Tag Team Championship to Corey Graves and Kassius Ohno on the June 26 episode of "NXT", Dylan was released from WWE in August 2013, but Lefort continued to manage Dawson. He also began managing Alexander Rusev. He made his NXT in-ring debut teaming with Rusev in a win over Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady. After the match, Rusev turned on Lefort and sided with the debuting Lana. Lefort went on to lose to Rusev in a singles match. With Dawson injured, Lefort began to wrestle in singles competition losing to Mason Ryan in early 2014.
On the May 8 "NXT", Lefort formed a new tag team with himself and Marcus Louis as the Legionnaires.

<doc id="36665194" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36665194" title="Topličice, Semič">
Topličice, Semič

Topličice (; formerly also "Male Toplice"; , Gottscheerish: "Teplitzle") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Sredgora. It lies in a narrow dry valley 1 km east of Sredgora.
Name.
The name "Topličice" and names like it (e.g., "Dolenjske Toplice") are derived from the Slovene common noun *"toplica" 'hot spring', referring to a local geological feature. The German name "Töplitzel" and Gottscheerish name "Teplitzle" are derivd from the Slovenian name. Both the Slovene and German names are diminutives (with the suffixes "-ice" and "-el"), also reflected in the obsolete Slovene name "Male Toplice", all literally 'little hot spring(s)'. The diminutive form may have also helped differentiate the settlement from many others named "Toplice/Töplitz".
History.
Topličice was a Gottschee German village. It was not recorded in the land registry of 1574, and so it may have developed later as a settlement founded under the Counts of Blagay. It had six houses in 1750. Before the Second World War, the village had four houses and a population of 17. The forest railway between Rog and Črnomelj ran near the village. The population made a living by selling wood, raising livestock, and some viticulture, with vineyards located in Rodine. The original inhabitants were evicted from the village in the fall of 1941. It was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and was never rebuilt. The ruins of the village are now registered as cultural heritage.
Church.
A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Martin stood in the village. The church dated back to at least 1610, when its 80 kg bell was cast. As such, the church was the oldest known cultural monument in the Parish of Planina ().

Edward Rupert Burrowes

Edward Rupert Burrowes (1903–1966) was an artist and art teacher who founded the Working People's Art Class (WPAC), the first established art institution in Guyana. 
The E R Burrowes School of Art, an undergraduate institution accredited by the University of Guyana, is named after him.
Early years.
Burrowes was born in Barbados in 1903, of African origin.
He arrived in Guyana as a young child.
His father worked for the privately owned "Daily Chronicle". After his father's death, the family had little money to live on. When Burrowes left primary school he became a tailor's apprentice. 
He continued to study from books, and passed examinations in English Language and Literature, English History, and Scripture. He passed the City and Guilds examinations at an unusually young age, and was able to open his own tailoring shop.
Artist and teacher.
Burrowes was interested in art from an early age, and had natural talent.
Unable to afford to buy paints, he worked out how to make them using tailor’s chalk.
He was a frequent visitor to the Georgetown Museum, and was fascinated by the Indian artifacts and displays of Guyanese geology that he saw there.
The British Guiana Arts and Crafts Society (BGACS) was formed in 1932, and Burrowes became a member.
The established BGACS members were impressed by the talent he displayed in his landscape and genre paintings. 
The latter depicted working-class people in everyday scenes.
Burrowes began teaching Working Peoples' Free Art Class, which influenced artists such as Dr Denis Williams.
His goal was to give ordinary working people an opportunity to develop their artistic talents.
Burrowes founded the WPAC in 1948.
In 1949 he received a British Council scholarship which let him attend the Brighton College of Art, where he specialized in block printing.
When he returned after a year, he was appointed Art teacher at the Government Teachers’ Training College.
In 1954 Burrowes was appointed an Ordinary Member of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire for services to art in British Guiana.
In 1956 he was teaching Art and Art History at Queen's College.
He died in 1966.
Achievements.
In 1947 Donald Locke attended a class taught in Georgetown by Burrowes, which inspired him to take up painting.
Writing about Burrowes in the 1966 Guyana Independence Issue of "New World", Locke describes how he was constantly engaged in "technical exploration", including making his own paints from unlikely ingredients and conducting experiments "with balata, buckram, tailor's canvas, rice bags, bitumen, concrete and ... clay mixed with molasses."
Denis Williams called him "the Barbadian who fathered the plastic arts in Guyana in terms of a European ancestry."
The WPAC helped a number of Guyanese artists at the start of their career.
Stanley Greaves attended the WPAC with Locke as a teenager and later became well known.
Emerson Samuels was another artist who studied at the WPAC.
The painter Aubrey Williams studied with E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class after returning from a two-year term with the Agriculture department in which he had lived with indigenous people in the jungle. In 1987, Williams described Burrowes as "a genius" who "opened the Guyanese eyes to art, in its aesthetic sense".

The Simpsons episode guides

Five official "The Simpsons" episode guides have been published since 1997. The first covers seasons one to eight, while the following three covers two seasons each. The latest one was released in 2010 and covers season one to twenty.
"The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family".
"The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family" is a book published by HarperCollins in 1997 that provides an episode-by-episode history of the first eight seasons of "The Simpsons". It was edited by Ray Richmond and Antonia Coffman. It includes a foreword by series creator Matt Groening. As an in-joke, the guide made an actual appearance in the 2003 episode "Today I Am a Clown", where Lisa uses it to remind Homer that Santa's Little Helper was supposedly neutered in a previous episode (specifically, "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds").
Each full-length episode receives either a one- or two-page coverage, featuring a synopsis, credits, pictures, and memorable quotes, as well as the episode's blackboard joke. Obscure or hidden jokes are also brought to attention. The episodes are arranged in chronological order, and at the beginning of each season are two-page special features, such as a list and brief description of "The Simpsons shorts", a list of times Homer has cried "D'oh!", and a list of Itchy & Scratchy's cartoons. On two pages there are short biographies of each of the five immediate members of the Simpson family, namely Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Short biographies of other "Simpsons" characters are also available as sidebars to each episode's page, starting with Santa's Little Helper for "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" and ending with Willem Dafoe's Commandant from "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson".
"The Simpsons Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Continued".
"The Simpsons Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Continued" is an episode guide for the ninth and tenth seasons of the "The Simpsons". The book is the first companion to the original "The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family", and was also published HarperCollins. "The Simpsons Forever!" was edited by Scott M. Gimple and released in 1999.
Groening wrote an introduction to "The Simpsons Forever!", just as he did with the original book. In his introduction, he claims that the choice was made to publish a second book as opposed to revising and republishing the last edition, to spare consumers from purchasing material they already owned. Groening goes on to describe the format of the book, which, like the last, includes synopses and quotes. The book continues the work of the last edition by listing the times Homer cries "D'oh!" or says "Mmm...", as well as new couch gags, but it includes unique features as well, including a tribute to Troy McClure, whose character was retired after his voice actor, Phil Hartman, was murdered. The guide also includes the lyrics to the "Simpsons"-related songs, "Do the Bartman" and "Deep, Deep Trouble".
"The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued".
"The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued" is an episode guide for the eleventh and twelfth seasons of "The Simpsons". It was edited by Jesse L. McCann and published in 2002 by HarperCollins. The book is a companion to the prior "Simpsons" episode guides. The book consists of synopses and quotes for each episode, beginning with "Beyond Blunderdome" and ending with "Simpsons Tall Tales". In this way it follows the last two books. However, this edition dedicates two pages of coverage to every episode, and four pages of coverage for each Halloween special. It thus outdoes the prior editions, which had one-to-two page coverage for each episode. The book also continues the work of the last two editions by listing the times Homer cries "D'oh!" or says "Mmm...", as well as new couch gags, but it includes unique features as well, like Church marquees. Sketches from the early production are included.
Groening wrote an introduction to the book, as he had for the previous editions. In it, he refers to the eleventh and twelfth seasons as the "Wackier-Than-Ever Years", and explains that it had been the objective to take the series in unexpected directions. To this end, the character Apu became the father of octuplets ("Eight Misbehavin'") and Homer lost a thumb ("Trilogy of Error"). Groening also acknowledges the death of the character Maude Flanders during this timeframe ("Alone Again, Natura-Diddily"), saying that it was "funny, funny stuff — well, weird, anyway." Groening goes on to claim that these two seasons contained some of his personal favorite scenes from all the series. He lists among these the farm animals driven insane by the food product tomacco ("E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)") and the portrayal of the dolphins enslaving mankind ("Treehouse of Horror XI"). He also identifies the episode "Worst Episode Ever" as one of he particularly enjoyed, calling it "a very special story."
"The Simpsons One Step Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Continued Yet Again".
"The Simpsons One Step Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Continued Yet Again" is the third sequel to the "Simpsons" episode guide "The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family". It was edited by Jesse L. McCann and like its predecessors, has an episode-by-episode guide to seasons 13 and 14 of "The Simpsons". Each season begins with production art and ends with character designs. The first episode covered in the book is "Treehouse of Horror XII", the last being "Moe Baby Blues". Each episode guide includes quotes, a "Stuff You May Have Missed" section, and references to films, television shows, and books. As in the previous three books, each episode includes a character profile sidebar. All special guest stars appearing in seasons 13–14 are listed with the episode they appeared in. The last pages of the book include character designs, couch gags Homer's "D'oh!"s and "Mmmmm"s, an Itchy & Scratchy filmography, a "Who Does What Voice" section, songs featured on the show, and Church marquees.
"Simpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1–20".
"Simpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1–20" is the fourth sequel to the "Simpsons" episode guide "The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family". The book covers seasons one to twenty, covering "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" through "Coming to Homerica". The book was released on October 26, 2010 in the United States. Like its predecessors, it uses the same basic structure; however, all episode guides will be on double pages, now giving every episode from seasons one to ten double pages.

List of Indian Premier League umpires

In cricket, an umpire is a person who has the authority to make judgements on the field. There are two on-field umpires, who apply the laws, make all necessary decisions, and relay the decisions to the scorers. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 cricket in India, which has been held annually since its first season in 2008. In the six seasons of the league, 40 umpires have officiated at least one IPL match. Of these, Simon Taufel has officiated the most matches, serving as an umpire 55 times, while Subroto Das has officiated the fewest, serving in one match of the 2013 season. As of the 2013 season, an on-field umpire receives a salary for officiating a match. The umpires are sponsored by McDowell's No.1, whose branding is displayed on their uniforms. Kingfisher Airlines were the umpires sponsor for the first five seasons, and they paid for the sponsorship. The recipient team of the Fair Play Award is also decided by the number of points given by the umpires in the league. The umpires are also assessed by the umpires' performance and training manager; Taufel is in-charge of that post as of the 2013 season.
The first match of the IPL, played between the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders, was umpired by Asad Rauf and Rudi Koertzen, while the most recent match, the final of the 2013 season, was umpired by Kumar Dharmasena and Simon Taufel. Eighteen of the umpires are of Indian nationality, six are Australian, five are South African, three are New Zealanders. Two umpires are from England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka each; whereas there is one umpire from West Indies and Zimbabwe each. Only two men have served as IPL umpires in both the first season and the latest season, Rauf and Aleem Dar; and 15 umpires have served in only one season.
The list is initially organised by the number of matches as an umpire, and if the numbers are tied, the list is sorted by last name. This list is correct as of the 2013 IPL season, and do not cover the games played by the IPL teams in other tournaments, such as the Champions League Twenty20, the British Asian Cup or the 2008 Kolkata Knight Riders tour of Australia.

Research Plot 30

Research Plot 30, is a historic agriculture site on the North Dakota State University campus in Fargo, North Dakota. When the pioneers broke up the grass prairie sod, flax was usually one of the first crops sown. If flax was sown continuously or with short rotations between subsequent flax crops, the flax became diseased and was called "flax sick" by farmers. The symptoms were wilting and dying flax plants during the growing season. The site is located near Centennial Avenue and 18th Street North. Flax was first planted at the site in 1894 by Professor Henry L. Bolley, a noted researcher in flax botany. By 1900, the flax plants were dead or dying. Bolley identified flax pathogens introduced by the plants themselves as the cause, and further identified resistant plants. Flax breeding programs from all over the world have sent material to NDSU to be tested for resistance to flax wilt in Plot 30.
The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. At the time of the nomination, the site had been cultivated in flax for nearly a century.

Tony Swain (chemist)

Tony Swain (1922–1987) was a chemist known for his definition of a plant polyphenol with Bate-Smith, Haslam and White, which includes specific structural characteristics common to all phenolics having a tanning property. It is referred to as the White–Bate-Smith–Swain–Haslam (WBSSH) definition. 
The discovery in 1943 by Martin and Synge of paper chromatography provided for the first time the means of surveying the phenolic constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945, none more so than that of Bate-Smith and Tony Swain. He worked with Edgar C. Bate-Smith at Cambridge University.
Tony Swain was one of the first editors of "Phytochemistry" with Jeffrey Harborne. He started the sister journal "Biochemical Systematics" in 1973, renamed "Biochemical Systematics and Ecology" in the next year.

<doc id="36665555" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36665555" title="ABS Loan Level Initiative">
ABS Loan Level Initiative

The ABS Loan-Level Initiative began after support for the idea was recognised at a European Central Bank (ECB) public consultation. It establishes specific information requirements for asset-backed securities (ABSs) accepted as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. The aim is to allow market participants access to standardised timely information on loans and their performance. Access to this information should allow market actors to make more informed assessments of asset backed securities. The Eurosystem believes that the new data requirements will help both investors and third-party assessment providers with their due diligence. It is hoped that the loan level initiative will help instil transparency and ultimately confidence back into the securitisation market 
Following the ECB initiative, the Bank of England has made Loan Level information one of their extended eligibility criteria for ABS collateral, but without a costly central Data Warehouse and with free access to market participants.
Background.
Following the 2008 financial crisis the ECB wanted to restore confidence in the securitisations market. The perceived problems were a lack of transparency and the absence of a standardised system across asset classes. These made it difficult to make accurate risk assessments of the securities. Enabling better risk assessment would then have the effect of encouraging investors and reducing the current levels of reliance on the Eurosystem.
Objectives.
The officially stated European Central Bank aims of the initiative are 
Technical Working Group ABS.
Technical Working Group structure.
The Technical Working Group (TWG) was introduced to provide expert advice on the ABS Loan Level Initiative 
The TWG is broken up into 6 asset class groups:
Technical Working Group permanent members.
In addition there is a group of permanent members of the TWG – this group includes representation from:
The current chairman of the TWG is Fernando Gonzalez Miranda a representative of the European Central Bank
Development.
Stage 1 – ABS Loan Level Data Templates.
In 2009 the ECB began the project to introduce Loan-Level data reporting for ABS. The ECB’s Executive Board and Governing Council worked together so that the €2,084 Billion ABS market in Europe could be promptly restarted. LCM Partners was appointed as the senior advisor from the project’s inception. 
In December 2010 the ECB the Governing Council of the ECB announced its decision to establish loan level data requirements (referred to as the ABS initiative). As of the summer of 2012 the published data requirements will have to be complied with before a financial institution can pledge ABS as collateral with the ECB.
These data templates were decided upon following consultation with the Technical Working Groups. The individual asset class requirements were further deliberated by more specialist Technical Working Groups 
The ECB decided that in order for the data requirements to work effectively there must be a data-handling infrastructure. In April 2011 in a letter to President Trichet the ECB detailed its plan to develop a European Data Warehouse which would allow for the collection and transmission of the loan level data.
Stage 2 – Creation of Data-Handling Infrastructure With Market Group.
LCM Partners carried out surveys with investors and issuers in order to determine the most efficient way of structuring the data-handling infrastructure. 
Following LCM Partners’ consultations it was decided that the European Data Warehouse would receive the loan-level data from the originators and would then check it for compliance against the ECB templates.
Stage 3 – RfI and RfP.
An independent Market Group was established to oversee the Request for Interest and the Request for Proposals. The Market Group is composed of nine of the largest originators and purchasers of ABS in the market.
The Market Group oversaw the RfI and RfP and will continue to oversee the development of the European Data Warehouse by working closely with investors and the Technical Working Group.
Stage 4 – Selection.
Following the RfI and RfP the Market Group selected the following companies to advise and provide services for the European Data Warehouse:
European DataWarehouse.
The result of this development work is the European DataWarehouse GmbH.
The European DataWarehouse (ED) is an ambitious market led solution to the problems the ECB identified in the ABS market. ED’s responsibilities include ensuring that ABS market data is openly accessible and that all transactions are recorded. A key aim of ED to instil trust back into the ABS market which been a problem in recent times.
The ECB is set to make compliance with Loan Level Data disclosure compulsory before it will accept ABS securities as collateral for financing.
In July 2012 ED announced that it had placed all 15 of the investors it was seeking. This investor group consists largely of global banks and institutions
Bank of England.
The Bank of England has published similar data templates as the those published by the ECB. In contrast to the ECB, the ABS Loan Level information is also applicable to covered bonds. While the ECB eligibility criteria on Loan Level data will phase in starting from March 2013 (for RMBS), it has been mandatory for the Bank of England since December 2011. Further to Loan Level disclosure, eligibility criteria extend to a standardized transaction overview template and an open source cash flow model to be provided freely to investors and other market participants.

ATS D7

The ATS D7 was a Formula One racing car used by the ATS team in the 1984 Formula One season. The car was designed by Gustav Brunner and was driven for most of the season by German Manfred Winkelhock. He was joined in a second car late in the season by Formula One rookie, Austrian driver Gerhard Berger. It was the last ever car produced by the ATS team.
Early in the season, the D7 with its powerful turbocharged BMW engine, showed surprising speed, if not reliability. Winkelhock qualified 6th at Zolder for the Belgian Grand Prix and early in the race ran confidently in 4th place behind the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and René Arnoux and the Renault of Derek Warwick before exhaust failure put him out on lap 39. He then qualified 7th for the next race in San Marino and again was racing in the points (top 6) before his race ended in turbo failure.
Whinkelhock only managed to finish two races in the quick but unreliable D7, finishing 8th in both Canada and Dallas. After joining the team for his first race in Austria, Berger enjoyed better reliability. He finished 12th at the Österreichring before gaining his first ever points finish in F1 by placing 6th in Italy at Monza. However, as ATS had only entered one car for the season and Berger was in a second entered car, no points were awarded for his drive.
Despite Berger's 6th place at Monza, the ATS D7 scored no points for the 1984 season. Following the season BMW stopped supplying the team with its engines due to the lack of results and bad publicity team owner Günther Schmidt had gained for his pit lane antics. As a result Schmidt pulled the plug on the team at the end of the season.

The Iglesia de San Francisco de Asís ("Church of St. Francis of Assisi") is a Catholic church located in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain).
This church was originally a Franciscan convent and is now the second most important church of the city, after the Church of the Conception. The present church was completed in 1680 and notable for the large number of works of art he owns. The church has three naves and is one of the best examples of Baroque architecture in the Canary Islands.
Although the church is most famous because it is home to the miraculous image of the Señor de las Tribulaciones, a small picture that represents Jesus Christ, which is famous because after a cholera epidemic and morbidity in 1893, we made a procession with this image through the streets of the city and the epidemic stopped miraculously. For this reason the size is invoked as protector of the city and taking the title of Señor de Santa Cruz.

<doc id="36665580" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36665580" title="Dignitatis Humanae Institute">
Dignitatis Humanae Institute

The Dignitatis Humanae Institute (DHI), also known as the Institute for Human Dignity and L’Istituto Dignitatis Humanae, is a Catholic-inspired NGO based in Rome. Its mission is to "protect and promote human dignity based on the anthropological truth that man is born in the image and likeness of God." The primary aim of the DHI is "to promote this vision of authentic human dignity mainly by supporting Christians in public life, assisting them in presenting effective and coherent responses to increasing efforts to silence the Christian voice in the public square." The DHI coordinates several parliamentary working groups on human dignity based in various legislatures throughout the world and also hosts the annual invitation-only International Conference on Human Dignity, in Rome, which was held at the Vatican in 2013.
History.
According to founder Benjamin Harnwell, the motivation to create the DHI derived from a celebrated case in 2004 when Italian politician Rocco Buttiglione was vetoed for the position of the European Commission's Vice-President and Commissioner for Justice, Freedom, and Security apparently because of his Catholic beliefs. In 2008, as a response, a collection of Christian personalities formed the DHI to oversee the creation of several parliamentary human dignity working groups across a diverse number of legislatures.
Universal Declaration of Human Dignity.
The Universal Declaration of Human Dignity was launched on 8 December 2008 by the International Committee on Human Dignity and aims to codify what is meant by human dignity:
"that man is made in the image and likeness of God; that this image and likeness proceeds in every single human being without exception from conception until natural death; and that the most effective means of safeguarding this recognition is through the active participation of the Christian faith in the public square."
The Universal Declaration is the basis of the parliamentary working groups that have been established to promote it.
Organization.
The Institute has operated from Rome since 2011, moving from its office in the European Parliament where it had operated since its founding in 2008. Since July 2010, Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino, former President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, has held the position of Honorary President.
In February 2013, Cardinal Martino confirmed the appointment of Luca Volontè as Chairman of the Institute. Formerly a member of the Italian Parliament from 1996 to 2013 and President of the European People's Party in the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Volonté succeeded Lord Nicholas Windsor, who had served as chairman since 2011, himself taking over that role from DHI founder Benjamin Harnwell.
Parliamentary working groups.
In 2009, European Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering officially launched the European Parliament's Working Group on Human Dignity, and together with twenty-five other MEP’s, adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Dignity as the Working Group’s foundational document. Currently, there have been launched other parallel working groups within the national parliaments of Lithuania, Romania, and the United Kingdom, all based on the same document.
The aim of these groups is to provide a network of support for politicians who promote the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Dignity and to create a space where politicians can work together to uphold their Christian beliefs. As MEP Gay Mitchell explained, at the core of the European Parliament’s Working Group on Human Dignity is the belief in the human dignity of life from conception to natural death, and it is this belief that drives it.
Annual International Conference on Human Dignity.
Since 2012, the DHI has held an annual, invitation-only international conference on topics relating to human dignity. The first, which took place on 29–30 June 2012, was held at the European Parliament offices in Rome. The conference theme was "The Role of Christians in the Public Square", and the event featured a number of different speakers who spoke on topics concerning Christians in the public square, human dignity, the development of parliamentary working groups, and new evangelization.
The Second Annual International Conference on Human Dignity was held at the home of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, the historic Casina Pio IV, inside the Vatican City State from 27–29 June 2013. The theme of the conference was "Squeezed between European and national legal orders: Is there room for Christianity?", and legislators, academics, and clergy from around the globe presented on the topics relating to national constitutions; family policies; protection of life and human dignity; and freedom of religion, expression, and conscience.
To mark the close of the conference was the annual dinner, with the guest of honour Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, who delivered the keynote address. When addressing the conference attendees, Burke applauded the work of the DHI, exclaiming that he energetically endorsed "what the British Parliamentarian Lord Alton of Liverpool said about the Institute: It is indeed the most important organization promoting human dignity in the world today." Lord David Alton originally made this remark in an EWTN video featuring the Institute when he explained, "The Institute for Human Dignity is, I think, one of the most important initiatives probably in the world today."
Controversy.
The DHI – which has been labelled by its opponents as a "secretive Catholic lay-organisation" and “an influential if publicity-shy grouping that works within the European Parliament." – found itself in the spotlight during the 2011 Irish presidential elections, when two of the leading candidates in that race (Gay Mitchell and Dana Rosemary Scallon) were linked to it.

Guernsey loophole towers

The British built 15 Guernsey loophole towers at various points along the coast of Guernsey between August 1778 and March 1779 to deter possible French attacks after France had declared itself an ally of the American rebels in the American Revolutionary War. Towards the start of the Napoleonic Wars several towers received additional reinforcement in the form of batteries at their bases. Today, 12 towers still survive, three having been destroyed at different times. Two of the survivors, Petit Bôt and Rousse, contain interpretive exhibits that the public may examine.
History.
In 1778, General Henry Seymour Conway, Governor of Jersey, recommended that 30 towers (see Jersey Round Tower) be built there to impede a possible French incursion. As it happened, almost all the towers were built after the Battle of Jersey in 1781. However, in July 1778, the British government also authorized the building of 15 towers on Guernsey. These towers were designed to accommodate only muskets (i.e., there was no provision for artillery); though there was discussion of giving each tower a Coehorn mortar for the roof platform nothing came of this.
Manning the towers was the responsibility of the Royal Guernsey Militia. This force of 4-5,000 men consisted of a field artillery regiment and four infantry regiments. Service in the militia was compulsory and unpaid. The men took turns manning the towers and other fortifications assigned to each regiment.
A report of 1787 pointed out the towers' limitations. As a result, at the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, and during General Sir John Doyle's tenure as Lieutenant Governor (1803-1816), a number of the towers received supporting batteries, either at their base, or nearby. Also, in 1803, the towers had their roofs strengthened and they received 12-pounder carronades as additional armament.
During the German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II, the Germans modified some towers to their purposes, generally by replacing some of the loopholes with machine-gun slits. The Petit Bôt Tower provided one example; however, its recent restoration returned it to its pre-World War II form.
Design and construction.
The towers were all built to one design. They all had three floors, the two above the ground floor having loopholes that would permit musket fire to cover all approaches to the tower. Captain Frederick Bassett, RE, the Commanding Engineer in the Channel Islands, oversaw the towers' construction. They were to be built to the design of the Jersey round towers, but in fact deviated in a number of ways. They had a batter (slope) at the base, and were slenderer than the Jersey towers. The Jersey towers also later received machicolations, which are absent from the Guernsey loophole towers. 
The towers are 30ft (9m) feet tall, and have an external diameter of 20ft (6m) and an internal diameter of just over 12ft (3.7m). They have a batter to the walls to the first floor, and then rise straight up from there. 
The towers were built of Guernsey granites. Tower #1, at Houge à la Perre Battery, on Belle Greve Bay, St Peter Port, was built of St Peter Port gabbro. All the others were built of local granites, with Vazon being built of Cobo Granite (Adamellite).
The towers.
The towers are numbered sequentially, in a counter-clockwise direction from St Peter Port.

He was initially declared the winner in his second fight against Satoshi Shimizu of Japan due to controversial judging and refereeing. At the beginning of the third round, he was leading by 7 points; however, in the last 2 minutes of that round, Abdulhamidov began to tire. Shimizu repeatedly knocked him down, 6 times in total. AIBA officially overturned the ruling after an appeal by the Japanese Coach stating that Abdulhamidov should have been given at least 3 warnings and therefore disqualified. Shimizu went on to take the bronze medal.

Idylle (restaurant)

__NOTOC__
Idylle was a restaurant located in Zweeloo, Netherlands. It was a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin star in the period 1997-2007.
Owner and head chef of "Idylle" was Joop Zwiep.
The restaurant regularly organized culinary test-events under the name "Proef op de Tong" (Eng.: "Test on the Tongue") in which chef Zwiep often mocked with standard culinary practices. In 2001, he changed the flow of courses and started with a dessert. In 1997, he confused his guests by serving a blue asparagus soup.
The restaurant lost its star in 2008, due to Zwiep changing course from a fine dining restaurant to a cooking workshop in 2007.
"Idylle" is a former member of the Alliance Gastronomique Néerlandaise.
The restaurant is housed in a Dutch national monument, a Saxon farmhouse, built in the 19th century. Earlier it housed Michelin starred restaurant De Bokkenpruik.

Kirsten Geisler (* 1949 in Berlin) is a German New media artist.
Vita.
Geisler studied from 1985 to 1989 at the 'Gerrit Rietveld Academie, "and in 1991 at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam. Kirsten Geisler lives in Berlin and Haarlem.
Work.
Kirsten Geisler employs in her work with the interface between the real and virtual worlds . They discussed how these worlds are increasingly flowing into each other. Kirsten Geisler developed virtual sculptures using 3D and virtual reality technology. The body, its materiality, its traces and its presence in the media are the issues that shape their work and inspiration. Her work includes only computer-generated 3-D sculptures.
At the beginning created juxtapositions of real and virtual portraits of women such as Who are You?, 1996. Geisler took it to the socio-political debate about the virtual and digital and the construction of identity in a digitally networked world. In the work of the series Virtual Beauties, 1992-1996 the repertoire of the virtual 3-D characters, enhanced by the interaction with the viewer. The series focuses on the manifestation of feminine beauty ideals and reflects the obsession with beauty in a digitized and virtualized society. It works followed with full-length, stereotypical women's bodies such as Dream of Beauty, 1997 - 2000, and" Catwalk I "-." Catwalk II ", 2004, these virtual models created without photographic model you are the synthesis of ideal images of a woman, as they are given us by the media. They correspond to the ideals of the fashion industry and plastic surgery . In "Catwalk II" moves the figure like a model on the catwalk and presented as in a film report from a fashion show.
The development of this series with the version of "Brush Maya", 2011, transcends the boundaries between the real world and virtual world. Moved as a fictional character, Maya Brush in two worlds: the first time, leaving a virtual sculpture, the museum and art institutions dares step into the "real" life in the public media and global communication networks. Kirsten Geisler responds with "Maya Brush" on the increasing interconnectedness of our world: a virtual sculpture, whose body consists of a network of data, combined with his advocacy in the real world of media symbiosis with the global networks of our world.
Homo Virtualis - Maya Brush.
Maya Brush 
is a virtual, photorealistic sculpture, created by the artist Kirsten Geisler in 2008–2011. Maya Brush consist of bits and bytes; her name is a composition which refers to the tools with which she was put to gether: a combination oft the software Maya and the ZBrush programme.
Maya Brush is the first virtual beauty, an artificial body, oriented at the human beauty ideal, without being created after a personal physical example. As a model she has become the reality of the dream of medial beauty imaginations. Maya Brush represents all the global prefab-girls, the standardized and technically created beauties as propagated by advertising industry and media. As an artificial figure maya floats between the various on- and offline worlds. For the first time a virtual sculpture will be able to leave the museum and art institutions and dare the step into real life. The media public and the global communication networks may serve as her home as well as the museums to which she will always return with her experiences.
Since her birth Renowned fashion photographers as Peter Lindberg and Karl Lagerfeld work with her as model.

Iipumpu Ya Tshilongo

Iipumpu Ya Tshilongo (1875–1959) was king of the Uukwambi, an Ovambo clan in Namibia, from 1907 to 1932. He is one of the national heroes of Namibia.
Biography.
Iipumpu Ya Tshilongo was born in 1873 in Onatshiku, a settlement near Elim, today in the Omusati Region of northern Namibia. An accident as adolescent earned him the nickname "Ndilimani" (Oshiwambo: "dynamite") when an explosion blew three fingers off his left hand.
He became the eighteenth king of the Uukwambi in 1907, succeeding king Negumbo lya Kandenge. During his reign he became known to jealously protect the tribal area of the Uukwambi from encroaching white settlers, going as far as having the roads guarded that led into Uukwambi territory.
Ya Tshilongo also resisted European cultural influence exercised via the establishment of mission stations and administrative outposts. Having rebuked the Finnish Missionary Society and the South-West African Administration for years, he only allowed the Catholic Church to establish a station at Oshikuku in 1924. He ignored the Administration's request to send contract labourers, refused to pay taxes, and was generally uncooperative towards the authorities.
Oral history and archival records characterise Ya Tshilongo as a despotic tyrant who ruled with an iron fist. He had many of his subjects flee his influence, including his own daughter, Neekulu ya Shivute. Both his stubbornness towards the authorities and his questionable way to rule led to a decision to topple him. In 1932, troops under Resident Commissioner Hahn attacked the Uukwambi during his absence and had his homestead at Onashiku bombed with military aircraft.
Iipumpu Ya Tshilongo was later arrested and forced into exile to Kavango. He only returned in 1938 due to illness. Ya Tshilongo died in Oshikuku on 9 September 1959.
Recognition.
Iipumpu Ya Tshilongo is one of nine national heroes of Namibia that were identified at the inauguration of the country's Heroes' Acre near Windhoek. Founding president Sam Nujoma remarked in his inauguration speech on 26 August 2002 that:
Chief Lipumbu ya Tshilongo was a true Namibian nationalist ruler who rejected the idea to pay taxes to the South Africa colonial authorities and who refused to cooperate with them. He also did not allow the missionaries to gain any influence over him or his people. [...] His resistance and strong nationalistic character inspired many
people, even in his absence, to continue with the anti-colonial struggle. [...] To his revolutionary spirit and his visionary memory we humbly offer our honor and respect.
Ya Tshilongo is honoured in form of a granite tombstone with his name engraved and his portrait plastered onto the slab.

Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory

Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory is a timeline of the Mars Science Laboratory mission and its rover, "Curiosity". As of , , "Curiosity" has been on the planet Mars for sols ( days).
Prelaunch - April, 2004.
In April 2004, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) called for scientific experiments and instruments proposals for the Mars Science Laboratory and rover mission. Launch was proposed for September 2009. By December 14, 2004, eight proposals were selected, including instruments from Russia and Spain.
Testing of components also began in late 2004, including Aerojet's monopropellant engine with the ability to throttle from 15–100 percent thrust with a fixed propellant inlet pressure. By November 2008 most hardware and software development was complete, and testing continued. At this point, cost overruns were approximately $400 million. On December 2008, lift-off was delayed to November 2011 due to insufficient time for testing and integration.
Between March 23–29, 2009, the general public ranked nine finalist rover names ("Adventure, Amelia, Journey, Perception, Pursuit, Sunrise, Vision, Wonder", and "Curiosity") through a public poll on the NASA website. On May 27, 2009, the winning name was announced to be "Curiosity". The name had been submitted in an essay contest by Clara Ma, a then sixth-grader from Kansas.
Landing site selection.
[[File:Curiosity Cradled by Gale Crater.jpg|thumb|Aeolis Mons rises from the middle of Gale Crater - Green dot marks the "Curiosity" rover landing site in Aeolis Palus
At the first MSL Landing Site workshop, 33 potential landing sites were identified. By the second workshop in late 2007, the list had grown to include almost 50 sites, and by the end of the workshop, the list was reduced to six; in November 2008, project leaders at a third workshop reduced the list to these four landing sites:
A fourth landing site workshop was held in late September 2010, and the fifth and final workshop May 16–18, 2011. On July 22, 2011, it was announced that Gale Crater had been selected as the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory mission.
Launch - November, 2011.
MSL was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 on November 26, 2011, at 10:02 EST (15:02 UTC) aboard an Atlas V 541 provided by United Launch Alliance. The first and second rocket stages, along with the rocket motors, were stacked on October 9, 2011 near the launch pad. The fairing containing the spacecraft was transported to the launch pad on November 3, 2011.
On December 13, 2011, the rover began monitoring space radiation to aid in planning for future manned missions to Mars.
The interplanetary journey to Mars took more than eight months, time during which, the spacecraft performed four trajectory corrections: on January 11, March 26, June 26 and on July 28. Mission design had allowed for a maximum of 6 trajectory correction opportunities.
Landing - August, 2012.
"Curiosity" landed in the Gale Crater at 05:17 UTC on August 6, 2012. Upon reaching Mars, an automated precision landing sequence took over the entire landing events. A cable cutter separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell and then the cruise stage was diverted into a trajectory for burn-up in the atmosphere. Landing was confirmed simultaneously by 3 monitoring Mars orbiters. "Curiosity" landed on target and only from its center. The coordinates of the landing site (named "Bradbury Landing") are: .
Some low resolution Hazcam images were beamed to Earth by relay orbiters confirming the rover's wheels were deployed correctly and on the ground. Three hours later, the rover begins to beam detailed data on its systems' status as well as on its entry, descent and landing experience. Aerial 3-D images of the landing site are available and include: the "Curiosity" rover and related Parachute (HiRISE, October 10, 2012).
On August 8, 2012, Mission Control began upgrading the rover's dual computers by deleting the entry-descent-landing software, then uploading and installing the surface operation software; the switchover was completed by August 15.
Events - August to December, 2012.
The science and operations teams have identified at least six possible routes to the base of Mount Sharp, and estimate about a year studying the rocks and soil of the crater floor while "Curiosity" slowly makes its way to the base of the mountain. The ChemCam team expects to take approximately one dozen compositional measurements of rocks per day.
Having completed its mobility tests, the rover's first drive began on August 29, 2012 to a place called Glenelg about to the east. Glenelg is a location where three types of terrain intersect, and is the mission's first major driving destination. The drive across may take up to two months, after which "Curiosity" will stay at Glenelg for a month.
On the way, "Curiosity" studied a pyramidal rock dubbed "Jake Matijevic" after a mathematician-turned-rover-engineer who played a critical role in the design of the six-wheeled rover, but died just days after "Curiosity" landed in August.
Evidence for ancient water.
On September 27, 2012, NASA scientists announced that the "Curiosity" rover found evidence for an ancient streambed suggesting a "vigorous flow" of water on Mars.
On October 7, 2012, a mysterious "bright object" (image), discovered in the sand at "Rocknest", drew scientific interest. Several close-up pictures (close-up 1) (close-up 2) were taken of the object and preliminary interpretations by scientists suggest the object to be "debris from the spacecraft". Nonetheless, further images in the nearby sand have detected other "bright particles" (image) (close-up 1). These newly discovered objects are presently thought to be "native Martian material".
On October 17, 2012, at "Rocknest", the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil was performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the weathered basaltic soils of Hawaiian volcanoes. The sample used is composed of dust distributed from global dust storms and local fine sand. So far, the materials "Curiosity" has analyzed are consistent with the initial ideas of deposits in Gale Crater recording a transition through time from a wet to dry environment.
On November 22, 2012, the "Curiosity" rover analyzed a rock named "Rocknest 3" with the APXS and then resumed traveling toward "Point Lake" overlook on its way to Glenelg Intrigue.
On December 3, 2012, NASA reported that "Curiosity" performed its first extensive soil analysis, revealing the presence of water molecules, sulfur and chlorine in the Martian soil. The presence of perchlorates in the sample seems highly likely. The presence of sulfate and sulfide is also likely because sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were detected. Small amounts of chloromethane, dichloromethane and trichloromethane were detected. The source of the carbon in these molecules is unclear. Possible sources include contamination of the instrument, organics in the sample and inorganic carbonates.
Events - January to December, 2013.
Evidence for ancient habitability.
In February 2013, the rover used its drill for the first time.
In March 2013, NASA reported "Curiosity" found evidence that geochemical conditions in Gale Crater were once suitable for microbial life after analyzing the first drilled sample of Martian rock, "John Klein" rock at "Yellowknife Bay" in Gale Crater. The rover detected water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Chloromethane and dichloromethane were also detected. Related tests found results consistent with the presence of smectite clay minerals.
Evidence for atmospheric loss.
On April 8, 2013, NASA reported that much of the atmosphere of Mars has been lost based on argon isotope ratios studies. The scientists found evidence that Mars "has lost a good deal of its atmosphere over time", based on the abundance of isotopic compositions of gases, particularly those related to argon and carbon.
On July 19, 2013, NASA scientists published the results of a new analysis of the atmosphere of Mars, reporting a lack of methane around the landing site of the "Curiosity" rover. In addition, the scientists found evidence that Mars "has lost a good deal of its atmosphere over time", based on the abundance of isotopic compositions of gases, particularly those related to argon and carbon.
Further events.
On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup computer due to an issue with the then active computer's flash memory which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The backup computer was turned on in safe mode and was converted to operational status on March 19, 2013.
On March 18, 2013, NASA reported evidence of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of "Tintina" rock and "Sutton Inlier" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like "Knorr" rock and "Wernicke" rock. Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of , in the rover's traverse from the "Bradbury Landing" site to the "Yellowknife Bay" area in the "Glenelg" terrain.
Between April 4 and May 1, 2013, "Curiosity" operated autonomously due to a Martian solar conjunction with Earth. While "Curiosity" transmitted a beep to Earth each day and the "Odyssey "spacecraft continued to relay information from the rover, no commands were sent from mission control since there was a possibility of data corruption due to interference from the Sun. "Curiosity" continued to perform stationary science at Yellowknife Bay for the duration of the conjunction.
On June 5, 2013, NASA announced that "Curiosity" will soon begin a journey from the Glenelg area to the base of Mount Sharp. The trip is expected to take nine months to a year with stops along the way to study the local terrain.
On July 16, 2013, the "Curiosity" rover reached a milestone in its journey across Mars, having traveled , since its landing in 2012; on August 1, 2013, the rover traveled over "One-Mile", .
On August 6, 2013, NASA celebrated "Curiosity" first year on Mars (August 6, 2012 to August 5, 2013) by programming the rover to perform the "Happy Birthday" song to itself. NASA also released several videos (video-1, video-2) summarizing the rover's accomplishments over the year. Primarily, the mission found evidence of "ancient environments suitable for life" on Mars. The rover drove over one-mile across the Martian terrain, transmitted more than 190 gigabits of data to Earth, including 70,000 images (36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnails), and the rover's laser fired more than 75,000 times at 2,000 targets.
On August 27, 2013, "Curiosity" used autonomous navigation (or ""autonav""- the ability of the rover to decide for itself how to drive safely) over unknown Martian ground for the first time.
On September 19, 2013, NASA scientists, on the basis of further measurements by "Curiosity", reported no detection of atmospheric methane with a measured value of ppbv corresponding to an upper limit of only 1.3 ppbv (95% confidence limit) and, as a result, conclude that the probability of current methanogenic microbial activity on Mars is reduced.
On September 26, 2013, NASA scientists reported the Mars "Curiosity" rover detected "abundant, easily accessible" water (1.5 to 3 weight percent) in soil samples at the Rocknest region of Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater. In addition, NASA reported that the "Curiosity" rover found two principal soil types: a fine-grained mafic type and a locally derived, coarse-grained felsic type. The mafic type, similar to other Martian soils and Martian dust, was associated with hydration of the amorphous phases of the soil. Also, perchlorates, the presence of which may make detection of life-related organic molecules difficult, were found at the "Curiosity" rover landing site (and earlier at the more polar site of the Phoenix lander) suggesting a "global distribution of these salts". NASA also reported that Jake M rock, a rock encountered by "Curiosity" on the way to Glenelg, was a mugearite and very similar to terrestrial mugearite rocks.
On October 17, 2013, NASA reported, based on analysis of argon in the Martian atmosphere, that certain meteorites found on Earth thought to be from Mars are actually from Mars.
On November 13, 2013, NASA announced the names of two features on Mars important to two active Mars exploration rovers in honor of planetary scientist Bruce C. Murray (1931-2013): "Murray Buttes", an entryway the "Curiosity" rover will traverse on its way to Mount Sharp and "Murray Ridge", an uplifted crater that the Opportunity rover is exploring.
On November 25, 2013, NASA reported that "Curiosity" has resumed full science operations, with no apparent loss of capability, after completing the diagnosis of an electrical problem first observed on November 17. Apparently, an internal short in the rover's power source, the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, caused an unusual and intermittent decrease in a voltage indicator on the rover.
On November 27, 2013, an overview (titled, "The World of Mars") of current and proposed Mars exploration by John Grotzinger, chief scientist of the "Curiosity" rover mission, was published in the New York Times.
On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that the planet Mars had a large freshwater lake (which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life) based on evidence from the "Curiosity" rover studying Aeolis Palus near Mount Sharp in Gale Crater.
On December 9, 2013, NASA researchers described, in a series of six articles in the journal Science, many new discoveries from the "Curiosity" rover. Possible organics were found that could not be explained by contamination. Although the organic carbon was probably from Mars, it can all be explained by dust and meteorites that have landed on the planet. Because much of the carbon was released at a relatively low temperature in "Curiosity" Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package, it probably did not come from carbonates in the sample. The carbon could be from organisms, but this has not been proven. This organic-bearing material was obtained by drilling 5 centimeters deep in a site called "Yellowknife Bay" into a rock called “"Sheepbed mudstone"”. The samples were named "John Klein" and "Cumberland". Microbes could be living on Mars by obtaining energy from chemical imbalances between minerals in a process called chemolithotrophy which means “eating rock.” However, in this process only a very tiny amount of carbon is involved — much less than was found at "Yellowknife Bay".
Using SAM’s mass spectrometer, scientists measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that cosmic rays produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by "Curiosity" was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. Next, they hope to find a site tens of millions of years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop.
The absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions to the surface of Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. This study estimates that a 1-meter depth drill is necessary to access possible viable radioresistant microbe cells. The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to 1 sievert is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil.
The samples examined were probably once mud that for millions to tens of millions of years could have hosted living organisms. This wet environment had neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. These types of iron and sulfur could have been used by living organisms. C, H, O, S, N, and P were measured directly as key biogenic elements, and by inference, P is assumed to have been there as well. The two samples, "John Klein" and "Cumberland", contain basaltic minerals, Ca-sulfates, Fe oxide/hydroxides, Fe-sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites (a type of clay). Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby aeolian deposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite plus magnetite, so Fe-forsterite (type of olivine) was probably altered to form smectite (a type of clay) and magnetite. A Late Noachian/Early Hesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time; therefore, in this location neutral pH lasted longer than previously thought.
On December 20, 2013, NASA reported that "Curiosity" has successfully upgraded, for the third time since landing, its software programs and is now operating with version 11. The new software is expected to provide the rover with better robotic arm and autonomous driving abilities. Due to wheel wear, a concern to drive more carefully, over the rough terrain the rover is currently traveling on its way to Mount Sharp, was also reported.
Events - January to December, 2014.
On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the "Curiosity" and "Opportunity" rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.
On February 6, 2014, the "Curiosity" rover, in order to reduce wear on its wheels by avoiding rougher terrain, successfully crossed (image) the "Dingo Gap" sand dune and is now expected to travel a smoother route to Mount Sharp.
On May 19, 2014, scientists announced that numerous microbes, like "Tersicoccus phoenicis", may be resistant to methods usually used in spacecraft assembly clean rooms. It's not currently known if such resistant microbes could have withstood space travel and are present on the "Curiosity" rover now on Mars.
On June 3, 2014, "Curiosity" observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.
On June 24, 2014, "Curiosity" completed a Martian year—687 Earth days—after finding that Mars once had environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.
Current status.
"Curiosity" is currently traveling to the base of Mount Sharp, where more information about the history of Mars is expected to be found. As of June 17, 2014, the rover has traveled about 58% of the way - an estimated linear distance of of the total trip - to the mountain base since leaving its ""start"" point in Yellowknife Bay on July 4, 2013.

Randmeer

The Randmeer is a medium size sailing boat designed by E.G. van de Stadt. In the Netherlands it is often used for One-Design sailing races. Developed in the 60's it was made especially for sailing on the so-called 'randmeren'; small shallow lakes that surround newly created land.This makes the boat perfect for rougher but shallow waters.
Size.
De Randmeer is 6,50 meters long and 2,10 meters wide. The hull weighs 500 kilograms. The draft can vary, depending on whether it has a keel or a centre board, between 0,55 and 1,15 meters. The mainsail has a surface area of 11,4 m², the jib has a surface area of 7,7 m². The 'Touring' type has a jib of 5,6m². In addition it can be sailed with a spinnaker of 19,5 m². All boats are produced at the shipyard in Heeg, Friesland, The Netherlands.
Types.
Within the Randmeer class there are three types: the "Classic"; the "Advance"; and the "Touring". The Classic, as can inferred from the name, is the original design that dates back to 1964. The Classic has a kielmidzwaard, a combination of a not-too-long keel with a retractable centerboard inside it. This means that its draft can vary between 0,55 and 1,15 meters.
The most obvious difference between the Classic and the Advance is that the Advance cockpit floor is higher. Due to this shallower cockpit the Advance is completely self-baling. Moreover, except for the rudder, all wood has disappeared from the design. Similar to the Classic the Advance has a "kielmidzwaard".
The Touring type is made for recreational use only. The hull is almost the same as the Advance, but it has a fixed keel, with a total draft of 0,75 meters. In addition, this ship has a pierced rudder; i.e. it goes through the hull instead of being hung behind it. This means that the Touring type does not comply with the One-Class design.
Van de Stadt also designed a version with a cabin: the Trotter. This has later been developed into the Trotter Pandora, often constructed in England.

Working People's Art Class

The Working People's Art Class (WPAC), founded by Edward Rupert Burrowes in 1945, was the first established art institution in the colony of British Guiana, now the country of Guyana.
A number of well-known Guyanese artists were taught at the WPAC.
Foundation.
Burrowes started to lead Working People's Free Art Classes in 1945 and formally founded the WPAC organization in 1948.
The name drew the attention of the British authorities, who were concerned that the classes might be a front for a communist organization.
They sent two detectives to join the class and see what was going on.
One of them, Inspector John Campbell, became interested in drawing and painting and continued with the WPAC, 
later participating in exhibitions.
By 1947, eighty-six students were enrolled in the free WPAC, which had started in Georgetown in April that year.
Operation.
The WPAC was an institution in which common working people could develop their artistic skills.
As well as teaching the people art history and appreciation, the WPAC contributed to developing a national consciousness, an awareness of the country and its peoples.
It was funded by businesses and institutions.
Burrowes was the only teacher, and gave classes on traditional Western artistic methods to anyone who chose to attend in whatever space he could find.
The British Council became interested in the WPAC, and provided help in the form of ₤50 worth of art materials annually, materials that could not otherwise be obtained in British Guiana, as it was then.
The WPAC put on annual shows.
In 1954 its exhibition of paintings and sculpture had contributions from the WPAC and from the Guianese Art Group, the Friday Art Club and the Young Contemporaries' Art Club, as well as from one or two individual artists.
The WPAC continued until 1956.
Influence.
The WPAC helped a number of Guyanese artists at the start of their career.
In 1947 Donald Locke attended a Working People's Art Class taught in Georgetown by Burrowes, which inspired him to take up painting.
Locke later contributed regularly to WPAC exhibitions, and became a secretary or assistant to Burrowes in the early 1950s.
Stanley Greaves was another Guyanese artist who attended the WPAC as a teenager and later became well known.
Emerson Samuels was another artist who studied at the WPAC.
The painter Aubrey Williams studied with E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class after returning from a two-year term with the Agriculture department in which he had lived with indigenous people in the jungle.

Lillestrom is an abandoned Scandinavian "Block settlement" in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan located in Hillsborough No. 132.
A block settlement (or bloc settlement) is particular type of land distribution which allows settlers with the same ethnicity to form small colonies. 
This settlement type was used throughout western Canada between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some were planned and other were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves.
The policy of planned blocks was pursued primarily by Clifford Sifton during his time as Interior Minister of Canada. It was essentially a compromise position. Some politicians wanted all ethnic groups to be scattered evenly though the new lands to ensure they would quickly assimilate to Anglo-Canadian culture, while others did not want to live near "foreign" immigrants (as opposed to British immigrants who were not considered foreign) and demanded that they be segregated. At the time Canada was receiving large amounts of non-British, non-French, immigrants for the first time, especially Italians, Germans, Scandinavians, and Ukrainians. The newcomers themselves wanted to settle as close as possible to people with a familiar language and similar customs. The government did not want the west to be fragmented into a few large homogenous ethnic blocks, however. So several smaller colonies were set up where particular ethnic groups could settle, but these were spaced across the country.

86th New York State Legislature

The 86th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 6 to April 25, 1863, during the first year of Horatio Seymour's second tenure as Governor of New York, in Albany.
Background.
Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county. 
At this time there were two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Democrats split over the civil war issue. The "War Democrats" and the Republicans formed a coalition known as the "Republican Union," and supported President Abraham Lincoln and the Union Army's war effort; the rump Democratic Party opposed the war, favoring a compromise with the South, and became known as "Peace Democrats" or "Copperheads." The Constitutional Union (consisting of former "Silver Gray" Whigs and Know Nothings) held a state convention and joined the Peace Democrats.
Elections.
The New York state election, 1862 was held on November 4. With a large contingent of soldiers at the Civil War front, who did not vote at the state election, surprisingly all five statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Democrats, including Gov. Horatio Seymour and Lt. Gov. David R. Floyd-Jones. The approximate party strength at this election, expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats/Constitutional Union 307,000; Republican Union 296,000.
64 Union Republicans and 64 Democrats were elected to the Assembly, resulting in a split.
Sessions.
The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 6, 1863; and adjourned on April 25.
On January 21, James A. Bell (R) was re-elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.
On January 26, after three weeks of deadlock, Democrat Theophilus C. Callicot (D) was elected Speaker on the 92nd ballot, receiving the votes of the Republicans. Callicot had talked to the Republican leader Chauncey M. Depew, and offered a deal: the Republicans should elect him Speaker, and he would help them to elect a U.S. Senator. 
On February 3, the Legislature elected Ex-Governor Edwin D. Morgan (R) to succeed Preston King (R) as U.S. Senator from New York for a six-year term beginning on March 4, 1863.

Uruguayan constitutional referendum, November 1989

A constitutional referendum was held in Uruguay on 26 November 1989 alongside general elections. The proposed changes to the constitution would require state pensions to be increased at the same rate as the salary of civil servants. The proposal was approved by 81.78% of those voting and 72.51% of all registered voters.
Background.
Uruguay was suffering from a high inflation rate of around 100% at the time of the referendum. It was held after a petition was submitted by pensioner organisations with the required signatures of 10% of the number of registered voters. In order to pass, the referendum had to be approved by a 50% of those voting and 35% of registered voters. Invalid or blank votes were taken to be "no" votes.
Constitutional amendments.
The proposals would amend article 67 of the constitution to state:
Aftermath.
The effect of the amendment was a rapid rise in pension expenditure, which increased government spending by around 2–3% of GDP.

Wemyss Private Railway

The Wemyss Private Railway was used to transport coal from the Wemyss Coal Company's mines to the docks at Methil in the Fife region of Scotland. 
History.
The North British Railway owned and operated a railway to transport coal from the many mines in Fife to the docks on the Forth estuary. In 1899, owing to the sheer volume of the mineral being extracted, the line was proving inadequate. Captain Randolph Wemyss, the greatest of the Fife coalowners, was therefore permitted to construct a railway from the mines to the port of Methil from where the coal was exported. Several branches were constructed so that each mine had access to the railway. In 1894 some 140,000 tons of coal was produced by the Wemyss mines, but by 1913 coal exports had reached a peak of 3,224,000 tons, much of it being transported on the private railway operating within a radius of 4 miles from the port. In that same year a third dock was opened at Methil to handle the coal ships. 
In 1947 the post war Labour Government created the National Coal Board to take over most of the mines in The United Kingdom, including the ones on The Wemyss Estate. The NCB also absorbed most of the Industrial railways which served these mines. However, as a result of certain legal peculiarities, the Wemyss Private Railway could not be taken over. Instead its operation was administered jointly be representatives from the Wemyss Estates and the NCB. 
Following the nationalisation most of the smaller engines which were used for shunting at the collieries were transferred from the Wemyss railway to the NCB. However, five 0-6-0 Ts which had been supplied by Andrew Barclay in the 1930s were retained. In later years a number of saddle tank engines were employed.
By 1967 only the Michael and Lochhead collieries remained in production. In September of that year there was an underground fire in the Michael colliery and the mine was closed. In 1970 the Lochhead colliery also ceased production. There was now no need for the railway and it too was closed.

Occipital nerve stimulation

Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), also called peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the occipital nerves, is used to treat chronic migraine patients who have failed to respond to pharmaceutical treatments.
The treatment involves the use of mild electrical impulses to stimulate the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve which are part of the peripheral nervous system and are located at the back of the head just above the neck area.
The electrical impulses are generated by a small device called a neurostimulator - similar to an artificial cardiac pacemaker - which is implanted in the buttock, chest, low abdomen, beneath the shoulder blade or below the clavicle. The electricity is delivered to the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve by small metal electrodes which are arranged on thin leads and implanted just under the skin. The intensity of the electrical impulses can be adjusted using a small remote control device.
History.
The history of PNS is thoroughly reported by Slavin, 2011. The use of PNS for chronic pain was first reported in 1967 by Wall and Sweet although the first implantations were performed in 1962 by Shelden. They demonstrated that electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves suppresses the perception of pain. A period of semi-experimental PNS usage continued for 15 – 20 years. During the latter half of the 1980s, PNS became an established surgical procedure. In the late 1990s, Weiner and Reed reported the percutaneous technique of inserting electrodes in the vicinity of the occipital nerves to treat occipital neuralgia. Weiner showed that placing a PNS electrode close to a nerve is effective for pain relief and a technically simple procedure. This pioneering work heralded the start of the modern era of PNS. It was 2003 before Popeney and Aló proposed using PNS for the treatment of chronic migraine. Subsequently, prospective randomized controlled trials were launched to gather additional clinical evidence.
In September 2011, St Jude Medical Inc. became the first company to receive European approval for the use of PNS in treating chronic migraine.
Candidates for the therapy.
Appropriate candidates for PNS of the occipital nerves for the treatment of chronic migraine must be diagnosed with chronic migraine which is classified as intractable.
Chronic migraine is defined by the International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines:
Intractable chronic migraine is generally defined as chronic migraine with failure of three or more preventive drugs and at least moderate disability determined using a validated migraine disability instrument (e.g. MIDAS or HIT-6).
Procedure.
Pre-operation.
Prior to the implantation, patients usually undergo a psychological assessment to assess their well-being and mental health. The risks of the procedure will be discussed and the patient will be asked for their informed consent. Risks that may be highlighted include no guarantee of effectiveness, infection, nerve damage, painful direct muscle stimulation, lead movement with loss of stimulation, lead fracture, battery failure, eventual need for battery replacement, hematoma and seroma formation.
Implantation.
In most cases, a trial (test) lead placement is performed in order to assess whether the stimulation will work as expected. Local anesthetic is applied to the back of the neck and a Tuohy needle is advanced towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve under fluoroscopic guidance. When the location is confirmed, a temporary lead is placed through the needle before the needle is carefully removed. Electrical impulses are sent through the lead and its position is adjusted until the patient reports a “pins-and-needles” sensation, called paresthesia, across the areas of the nerves. If paresthesia is successfully achieved in the right place, permanent leads are usually implanted at a later date. In some cases, the trial leads are left in for up to one week to see whether there is any relief of symptoms.
Permanent lead placement may be carried out under general anesthetic or local anesthetic with sedation. First, a small incision is made at the base of the skull, then a Tuohy needle is advanced under fluoroscopic guidance towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve on one side of the head. When the lead is adequately positioned through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance, the needle is carefully removed and the lead is fixed in place. Since most patients require two leads, a second lead is usually inserted and fixed in place on the other side of the head in the same way. The lead(s) are then tunneled to a neurostimulator device which is usually implanted the buttock, chest, low abdomen, beneath the shoulder blade or below the clavicle.
Clinical evidence.
Results from three randomized controlled trials have been published. One randomized controlled trial of 157 patients with chronic migraine was published in October 2012. Participants were implanted with the device and then randomized to have the device turned on (the treatment group) or off (the control group) for 12 weeks. After week 12, participants received active treatment until week 52. All participants had trial stimulation to ensure correct position of electrodes. A total of 153 participants completed 12 weeks in the trial. There was a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the number of patients in the treatment group]and control group at the 30% reduction in pain level using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In addition the study showed that, on average, the treatment group (device on) had 6.1 fewer days of headache days per month which was more than double the average reduction for the control group (device off), which is statistically significant (p<0.001). The clinical study investigators reported that the overall rate of serious device and procedure related adverse events was 1% and that these included one infection and one case of post-operative pain which required additional hospitalization.
In February 2011, the ONSTIM clinical study investigators reported three-month results from a randomized controlled trial of patients with chronic migraine. Participants were first given occipital nerve block. Those who responded were randomized into three groups. The first group was a treatment group (33 participants) and received adjustable stimulation. The other two groups were control groups and received sham stimulation for one minute per day or standard medical management (17 participants each). Patients who achieved a 50% or greater reduction in their number of headache days per month or a three-point or greater reduction in average overall pain intensity compared with baseline were defined as responders to the therapy. 39% of patients in the adjustable stimulation group were responders, 6% in the sham stimulation group and 0% in the medical management group. The differences between the responder rates in the treatment group and control groups were statistically significant. Other outcome measures, such as number of headache days, were not statistically significantly different between the groups. However, the percentage reduction in headache days was 27% for the treatment group and less than 9% for each control group, showing a numerical advantage for the treatment group. No unanticipated device adverse events were reported. Movement of the lead occurred in 24% of subjects.
In December 2009, the PRISM study investigators reported three-month results in abstract form from a randomized controlled trial of 125 patients with chronic migraine. Patients were randomized into two groups. One group was a treatment group and received active stimulation. The other was a control group and received sham stimulation. Patients in the treatment group reduced their number of migraine days per month by 5.5 from a baseline of 20.2 days per month. Patients in the control group reduced their number of migraine days per month by 3.9 from a baseline of 19.2 days per month. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. However, there was a trend towards a greater difference between the two groups when patients were not overusing medication.

Family Educational Services Foundation

Family Educational Services Foundation (FESF) is a non-profit, educational organization working in Pakistan since 1984, committed to enhancing the quality of life and education of those who are disadvantaged. FESF provides educational services to some of the most neglected sectors of Pakistan’s society, with particular focus on Deaf children and youth. FESF is registered as a non-profit organization with the SECP and is tax exempt. 
The organization’s main projects are:
Projects.
Deaf Reach Program.
Upwards of nine million people in Pakistan (5% of pop.) have some form of hearing loss. Of this group, there are approximately 1.5 million profoundly deaf children of school age – the majority of whom suffer from no educational opportunities. 
The Deaf Reach Program was established in Pakistan in 1998, initially working informally with deaf youth and young adults. The first Deaf Reach School was established by FESF in Karachi in 2005, and the program has grown rapidly to where there are now seven Deaf Reach Schools and Training Centers located in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Nawabshah, and Lahore, with a new large campus under construction in Rashidabad, Tando Allahyar.
These schools are providing free education and training to over 1,200 deaf children and young adults from low-income families in both urban and rural areas. There is an important focus on girls attending school, with a female enrollment of 48%. A new donated school on 2 acres of land is presently under construction in Rashidabad, Tando Allahyar, and will accommodate more than 500 students when completed in mid-2013. 
Deaf Reach is the only school for the Deaf in Pakistan that has a branch network, providing educational opportunities in rural areas. Training is also provided for all parents and families in learning how to communicate and care for their children. There is also an active Financial Inclusion program for deaf young adults with training in marketable skills leading to employment and financial independence.
Motivated Volunteer Empowerment Program.
The Motivated Volunteer Empowerment (MOVE) Program is aimed at high school and university students but is also effective as a training program. The training courses are organized and implemented by Family Educational Services Foundation (FESF). The international trainers from FESF have many years of experience in the field of volunteerism, educational development and humanitarian projects, thus lending a high degree of professionalism and skill to the comprehensive training program, which usually includes indoor training courses of 30 hours and are accompanied by outdoor field work by the trainees. The MOVE program is an educational development resource, which focuses on leadership, soft skills and volunteerism. The program meets the need for developing committed volunteers and engaging youth voice in solving social problems.
The Motivated Volunteer Empowerment Program (MOVE) develops committed volunteers and engages youth voice in solving social problems. It is designed to instill in the participants a sense of social responsibility and provides the requisite knowledge and leadership skills for the attendees to become actively involved in community work.
With 65% of Pakistan's population below the age of 25, there is great potential to make a long-lasting impact in the social development sector. Young people can and want to make a difference in society through their involvement in community projects. FESF has been working with Pakistani youth for over 12 years and has built a strong network of capable and motivated young volunteers. Several years ago it became evident that training was needed to empower the participants to make a greater impact. Thus the MOVE program was created as an educational development course, focusing on soft skill training, leadership and volunteerism.
Using creative media presentations, discussion forums, and interactive activities, the program seeks to instill in young people a sense of civic responsibility and concern for those who are less privileged. The course provides them with the requisite knowledge and skills to become actively involved in community work, covering such topics as: how to make a difference; team building, communication and interpersonal skills, working with children, understanding people with disabilities, how to establish and achieve goals, planning a community project, overcoming obstacles, leadership skills, etc. – and culminates with the hands-on experience of planning and carrying out a project.
MOVE is a six-session structured program, covering a wide variety of relevant topics. 
Workshop topics include:
The six training sessions are followed by two project planning workshops. At least one community development project is carried out by participants from each MOVE program. Theoretical training along with practical experience is a vital ingredient of MOVE. To this effect, FESF coordinates field implementation projects for the students in partnership with local institutions around the country. Many of the MOVE graduates have gone on to be actively involved in their community with some initiating and sustaining highly effective volunteer projects on a regular basis.
Community Services.
FESF provides social uplift and assistance to improve the quality of life for those less fortunate due to disability or other personal hardship.
A few programs that are regularly organized are:
All of these programs are achieved with the help of a dedicated team of volunteers, which is open for participation by interested persons.
Eduserve Training Program.
The Eduserve Training Program offers a wide range of training courses and seminars in the field of education and child development, focusing on the needs of teachers and parents of both mainstream and special needs children. These training courses outline innovative teaching techniques, as well as help to improve teaching methodology. Participants learn leadership and interpersonal skills, as well as classroom management- all of which will greatly benefit the students in their care.
Master Trainer Program.
FESF, in collaboration with NOWPDP launched a master trainer program in Jan. 2010, "Instructing and Guiding Children with Special Education Needs." The program objective is capacity building for teachers who impart special education in government and private schools countrywide. 10 master trainers were developed who went on to conduct courses for 226 teachers from 25 different institutes in Karachi and Islamabad.
Funding and support.
Family Educational Services Foundation is exempt from taxation under the Pakistan law. FESF receives the majority of its funding via donations and sponsorship from individuals, businessmen, corporate sponsorship and foundations.

Jean-Louis Morin (porcelain painter)

Jean-Louis Morin (1732-1787) was a French porcelain painter who worked at the Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory from 1754 to 1787. He was a specialist in figure painting known for his deceptions of military and marine scenes which he painted on useful wares, as well as ornamental and flower vases. Unusually he used his own sketches for the design of the paintings. His artist's signature featured a scrolling upper or lower cased letter M.
Morin was born in Vincennes, France, the son of an army surgeon, and initially studied surgery before enrolling at the Vincennes manufactory (Manufacture nationale de Sèvres) at age 21. He was described at the time as being '""five foot four inches high, with red hair, shifty eyes and nearly white ...and freckles, wearing a wig, with an ugly body.'" Although he had some ability in drawing he "had little talent for the more difficult task of applying colors". His early endeavors at the factory saw him painting cherubs into clouds and landscapes, on vases and tea wares, working alongside Dodin, one of the factory’s leading figure-painters. After a few years of practice Morin's work and skill had improved, and his use of colour was also making progress. By 1758 Morin began to work on coloured reserves, painting "realistic and picturesque scenes from the life of dockers and soldiers".
Morin worked at the factory until his death in 1787 at the age of 55.

Lucerna Music Bar

Lucerna Music Bar is a concert club housed within the Lucerna Palace, located on a hallway or "passage" that connects Vodičkova and Štěpánská streets near historic Wenceslas Square, in the New Town (Nové mesto) area of Prague in the Czech Republic. The name Lucerna means "lantern" in Czech. Lucerna Palace is an Art Nouveau building built by former President Václav Havel's family. The Lucerna Music Bar is one of the venues within Lucerna Palace involved in the Prague International Jazz Festival and the AghaRTA Prague Jazz Festival. It was used for the Václav Havel Tribute Concert, held in Václav Havel's honor, upon his death in 2011. The Lucerna Music Bar is similar in size to Washington, DC's , Cleveland's Agora Theatre and Ballroom, Philadelphia's Trocadero Theatre, or Baltimore's Rams Head Live!, however the selection of artists is more international. The Lucera Music Bar has played a role in giving exposure to many bands from the Czech Republic and around the world.
Lucerna Palace.
The building was designed by Havel (the grandfather of former president Václav Havel), Stanislav Bechyně and Václav Prokop, and built at the beginning of the 20th century. It was completed in 1921. The reinforced concrete construction is an early example of this type of construction and is described in a book by engineer Prof. Bechyně. The building was designed as the first multipurpose building It is a multilevel open air galleria that houses The Lucerna Music Bar and the Lucerna Theatre, a formal concert hall, in addition to an assortment of shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. The Lucerna Palace has been the site of many significant events in the country's history and is considered the most important private cultural centre in the city. It is the home of the Prague International Jazz Festival and was the site of Václav Havel Tribute Concert.
Cultural context.
Up until the end of the 1980s, Czechoslovakia remained under the control of one of the most repressive Communist governments in Eastern Europe. In 1964 Prague's "1st International Jazz Festival" was held in the hall and the following year Louis Armstrong performed there[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0075vxz]. Jazz Writers, musicians, artists and intellectuals are credited with promoting the democratic ideals that shaped the Velvet Revolution. Although they could not openly practice their arts, some writers and musicians were among the most elite members of society. A number of music related events transpired during the revolution. Charter 77, a human rights manifesto, was written in response to the arrest of a band called Plastic People of the Universe, one of Václav Havel's favorite bands. In 1979, Havel himself was imprisoned for activities on behalf of the charter and The Jazz Section was targeted by Communists for their work. Five members of The Jazz Section died in prison under suspicious circumstances.
Other countries, such as Hungary and Poland, had slowly been changing over time. In 1989, Czechoslovakia suddenly achieved freedom. Its first elected President was Václav Havel, a strong patron of the Czechoslovakian music scene. The Václav Havel Tribute Concert, held in his honor in 2011, featured a wide range of musical talent from around the globe. Following Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, the bans were lifted, and new record labels and publishing houses emerged, producing CDs, magazines, newspapers, and books. Previously banned plays, movies, books and records, including Havel's adaptation of The Beggar's Opera, became available. Previously forbidden news topics, such as drugs, skinheads, the black market, corruption in the Communist Party, began to appear in news media. After the Velvet Revolution, musicians were able to perform in public, and Velvet Underground and Doors songs became very popular. A celebration of this musical freedom was held at Lucerna Palace, including the Lucerna Music Bar. Currently, citizens are even free to hold benefit concerts whose proceeds go towards such causes as legalizing marijuana and abolishing the death penalty.
Events.
Today, Lucerna Music Bar is renowned for its 80s and 90s pop discos on Friday and Saturday nights. During the week the bar mainly hosts live music.

Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Paralympics was held from 30 August to 8 September at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London. Two events were contested: men's and women's team.
In the men's sitting event, Iran were the defending champions. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iran were the finalists in 2000, 2004 and 2008, with Iran winning in 2000 and 2008 and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2004. These two countries met once more in the final in Beijing, with Iran emerging victorious by 3–0. Egypt finished fourth in Beijing, beaten 2–3 by Russia, who took bronze. Bosnia and Herzegovina men's team won the gold in 2012.
The London Games marked the third time the women's sitting event was held. China were the defending champions. The Netherlands took silver, and the United States bronze, in 2004. In Beijing, China was again victorious, while the US and the Netherlands switched places to ascend the podium with silver and bronze, respectively.
Classfication.
In sitting volleyball there are two categories of classification: disabled and minimal disability. A maximum of one minimally disabled player may be on the court for each team at any one time. 
A part of the player's body between the buttocks and the shoulders must be in contact with the court when playing or attempting to play the ball.
Qualification.
There were 18 teams, 10 men's teams and 8 women's teams, taking part. Each country can enter one team per tournament.

Reflections on a Crime

Reflections on a Crime (AKA "Reflections in the Dark") is a 1994 American prison thriller written and directed by Jon Purdy. Mimi Rogers stars as a woman in the final hours of Death Row retelling the murder of her husband that she was incarcerated for.
Plot.
Regina, a death row prisoner, raises questions about her guilt when she recalls the murder of her husband, James, through a series of confessions and flashbacks. Colin, a prison guar, with a media interest, is intrigued by the beautiful Regina and her story. Colin questions Regina about her late husband's murder and receives conflicting answers, raising questions over the cause of James' death and whether or not Regina had intended to kill him. It also becomes clear to Colin that, during James and Regina's marriage, the former became possessive and abusive, struggling to deal with an earlier relationship of Regina's that she could not forget.
Reception.
"New York Magazine" praised Rogers' "typically terrific performance" in the film. Rogers also won the Best Actress prize for the film at the Seattle International Film Festival, with the "Seattle Times" praising her "strong" performance.

The Twa Knights

The Twa Knights is a traditional Scottish ballad. It was collected by Francis James Child as Child ballad number 268. It is highly possible that the ballad was popularly unknown in Scotland, and only known through print.
Synopsis.
The story belongs to the Aarne-Thompson Type 882: the wager on the wife's chastity.
It starts with two best friends, or "brothers sworn": one a knight, and the other a squire. They begin discussing women, and the unmarried squire pessimistically declares that there can't be more than nine good women in the world. The knight declares that he is lucky, for his wife is one of them. To test the truth of this claim, the squire suggests a plan where the knight goes off to sea for six months. He wagers his life that he will be able to gain the love of the lady before six months have passed. The knight insists that they lengthen the period to nine months, and then wagers all his lands on his wife's faithfulness.
Once the knight has left, the squire immediately tries to win the love of the "gay lady." At first approaches her directly, but she spurns his advances. Next the squire purchases the aid of his foster-mother with "fifty guineas and three." The foster-mother fakes concern for the lady and is able to convince her to send all her servants out to work the fields. Once the house is empty, the foster-mother lulls the gay lady to sleep and then leaves. The scheming old woman delivers all the keys to the castle to the young squire, who enters and wakes the lady in her bedchamber. He insists that she sleep with him, but the knight's wife refuses, saying that it would be a sin to defile her husband's bed. Instead, she agrees that she will come to his bed the next day.
The next day, the gay lady sends her niece, Maisry, to the squire in her place. The squire is unable to detect the deception and sleeps with the girl, taking her ring and her ring-finger as tokens of the night.
The knight returns after the appointed period has elapsed, and is greeted by the squire. The squire insists that he has won the knight's lands and shows the finger as proof. The knight, distraught, goes to punish his wife. When he arrives at the castle, however, the lady is able to show him her undamaged hand and reveal the plot that saved her chastity. The knight summons both Lady Maisry and the squire, and gives Maisry the choice of whether to stab her lover or wed him. After some deliberation, Maisry decides to marry the squire, and the ballad ends with a nod to her wisdom.
Parallels.
Within the Child collection, the story bears remarkable similarity to "Redesdale and Wise William," which is ballad number 246. This version focuses on two friends, Redesdale and Wise William, who wager on the chastity of William's sister. Redesdale bets with his lands, and William with his life. The sister spurns all advances, even when Redesdale burns down her house. Redesdale loses the bet and pays happily, convinced of the sister's goodness. Despite the differences of ending and the distinction of sister rather than wife, the tales are obviously related and both fit within the Aarne-Thompson Type 882.
Outside of the collection, a parallel story and possible source is found in many versions of the Greek tale, "Maurianos and His Sister." Some scholars have even compared it to Shakespeare's "Cymbeline".
Language.
Like a far more famous poem from the same period, To a Mouse, "The Twa Knights" is written in the Scots language. This can be easily observed from the title, which uses the word "Twa" instead of the English "Two." Here is a sample of the original ballad along with an English translation. The section comes near the beginning of the song, when the wager is first being made.

John J. Phelan, Jr.

John Joseph Phelan, Jr. (born May 7, 1931, died August 4, 2012) was an American financier who served as president and later chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, where he introduced computerized trading technology. Phelan's leadership tenure at the NYSE included the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, during which he declined to halt trading. Phelan's calm and confident manner was widely praised. After the crash, Phelan helped to implement trading curbs also known as "circuit breakers" to help prevent rapid stock selloffs in the future.
Early life.
Phelan was born in New York City on May 7, 1931 to John Phelan Sr., a financier and member of the NYSE, and Edna Kelly. He started college in 1949, but left after two years to serve in the US Marine Corps. After returning from the Marines, Phelan went to work as a floor trader with his father's firm, Phelan & Co. and attended Adelphi University, where he received a bachelor's degree in business administration.
Notable Achievements.
Phelan became the first foreigner to own shares of a Chinese company when he was presented with a stock certificate of the "Flying Happiness Acoustic Company" by the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Deng Xiaoping in 1986. John Phelan was at that time the head of a US delegation of Wall Street financiers. This was remarkable event that signaled Chinese commitment towards developing its own stock exchange as well as further economic reforms along market economy lines.

Leonie von Meusebach–Zesch

Leonie von Meusebach–Zesch (November 27, 1882 – July 7, 1944) was an early 20th Century pioneer female dentist who practiced in Texas, Alaska, Arizona and California. She is also known as Leonie von Zesch or Leonie Zesch. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2012.
She was a dental surgeon with the United States Army following the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. Her mother worked with the American Red Cross to document survivors after the disaster. After recovery, she provided onboard dental services to members of both the United States Pacific Fleet and the United States Atlantic Fleet. During the Great Depression, Meusebach–Zesch provided dental care to laborers with the Civilian Conservation Corps, and later to inmates at the California Institute for Women. For four years, she practiced in her home state of Texas, with an office in Mason. Three years of her dental career were spent in Arizona, where her patients included people from the Hopi and Navajo populations. To accommodate patients who could not travel to her practice in Winslow, Arizona, she hooked her equipment to the back of her Model T automobile and held mobile dental clinics around the state.
For fifteen years, Meusebach–Zesch practiced in the Territory of Alaska, with offices at varying times in Cordova, Nome and Anchorage. To serve remote Inuit villages, she traveled by airplane to islands in the Bering Sea. She survived an airplane crash on her way to Point Barrow and tried to walk to Kotzebue before being transported by an Inuit. Throughout Alaska's interior, she traveled by dog sled to hold mobile dental clinics for both Inuit and non-indigenous patients. She crawled on her abdomen across thin ice to save sled dogs from drowning. She and her assistant were stranded on one occasion, and were rescued by champion dog racer Leonhard Seppala.
Family background.
Leonie von Meusebach–Zesch was the eldest of two daughters born to Elizabeth and Leo Zesch. She was born November 27, 1882 in Mason County, Texas, and her sister Leota was born in Loyal Valley on June 9, 1886. As a child, Leonie had witnessed the aftermath of a public lynching in Mason, the corpses of the accused hanging from a tree in the town square. Leonie's mother Elizabeth (also referred to as Agnes Elizabeth) was born in Texas in 1862, the fifth of eleven (seven surviving to adulthood) children born to John O. Meusebach and his wife Austrian-born Agnes of Coreth, daughter of Count Ernst of Coreth. John O. Meusebach had been born Baron Otfried Hans von Meusebach in Dillenburg, Duchy of Nassau and renounced his title while he was still on the ship sailing to the United States. Ernst Coreth renounced his title when he became a citizen of the United States.
Elizabeth married Leo Burcheardt Zesch, who had been born in Mason, Texas in 1859. Thereafter, she used the hyphenated name Elizabeth von Meusebach–Zesch, as did her daughter Leonie. Leo's parents were Robert Zesch (originally Zoesch) and Lina Caroline Dangers (originally D'Angers). Robert Zesch emigrated from Saxony, Germany in 1854 aboard the ship "Ammerland", destined for New Braunfels. In her autobiography published after her death, Leonie refers to Robert Zesch as a former German military officer. The father of Robert Zesch was Carl Zesch, a tax officer in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Caroline Dangers, as well as her bricklayer father Wilhelm, and her mother Rebecca emigrated from Hanover, Germany, also aboard the "Ammerland" . Robert and Caroline were married on May 17, 1856. Their eight children were named Carl, Leo, Herman, Eugen, Meta, Minna, Martha and William.
California 1888–1908.
In 1888, mother Elizabeth moved to California with her six-year-old daughter Leonie and two-year-old daughter Leota. Their first home in California was Stockton, but they finally settled in San Francisco. Leonie von Meusebach–Zesch completed her basic education through high school in San Francisco, and in 1902 graduated from the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, at that time known as the College of Physicians and Surgeons. She became a practicing dentist in June 1902 after passing the California State Dental Board examination and being hired on to work for Swedish immigrant Dr. Matson. Meusebach–Zesch was expected to replace the duties formerly held by Dr. Matson's wife, and her work hours were initially presented as being 8 a.m.-9 p.m. She would find the reality being longer hours and seven days a week, eventually collapsing on the floor from exhaustion. It was during this period she also began to study the correlation of a patient's diet to their dental health.
At 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, San Francisco felt the first foreshock, followed within 20 to 25 seconds later by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the resulting fire. The disaster caused 3,000 deaths, destroyed 28,000 buildings and left 225,000 persons without housing. The United States Army under the command of Brigadier General Frederick Funston immediately went into rescue operations when the earthquake hit. Fire chief Dennis T. Sullivan suffered a skull fracture when the dome of the California Hotel fell through the fire department building. He died four days later.
Meusebach–Zesch and her mother evacuated their home after the earthquake and wandered through the streets of the city. She would later describe in vivid detail the chaos, merchant price gouging and human devastation she witnessed. They arrived at the Army station on the Presidio and offered their services. Her mother began working with the combined efforts of the Army and the American Red Cross to document survivors and assist with their needs. Meusebach–Zesch signed on as a Dental Surgeon with the Army, receiving pay for herself, and living quarters to accommodate both herself and her mother. They received word that Leota and her husband were safely on one of the Farallon Islands off the San Francisco coast. On July 1, the rescue and recovery efforts were transferred to the city. The Board of Health replaced Meusebach–Zesch with a male dentist. Brigadier General Funston interceded on her behalf and, with the concurrence of Mayor Eugene Schmitz, she was reinstated.
As San Francisco began to rebuild itself in 1907, Meusebach–Zesch attempted to start a private dental practice of her own. She did not receive many new clients, but she had additional income from appointments as dentist to the Children's Hospital and to the Maria Kipp Orphanage. In 1908, she received agreements from commanders of both the United States Pacific Fleet and the United States Atlantic Fleet to bring dentists and lab technicians aboard ships and provide dental services to the crew members. Although there was ample business, Meusebach–Zesch did not feel the endeavor had been financially profitable for her.
Texas 1908–1912.
Meusebach–Zesch and her mother returned to Mason, Texas in 1908, where she applied for a license to practice dentistry in the state of Texas. In the duration, she was a person at leisure visiting with friends and relatives in the state. She made a train trip to visit an uncle in Torreón, Mexico. On the train she met a group of Belgians who appeared to be smuggling clothing, jewelry and uncut diamonds across the border. She declined one offer from a Dallas businessman to front a state-wide chain of dental offices that he intended to manage in the background. Meusebach–Zesch accepted a position with a dental practice in San Antonio, where she treated members of the city's Maverick family. Anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were friends of the owners and came into town during a visit to San Antonio by President Howard Taft. When she passed her state board examination and became licensed in Texas, Meusebach–Zesch returned to Mason to practice.
In her memoirs, Meusebach–Zesch mentions an election year campaign barbecue when future Texas governors Miriam Ferguson and James E. Ferguson were present. The Fergusons had moved to Temple in 1907, where Jim Ferguson was founder and president of Temple State Bank. Neither Ferguson had yet held political office. In 1910, Jim Ferguson had served as campaign manager for the unsuccessful gubernatorial bid of Robert Vance Davidson. He had also been involved in the gubernatorial campaign of Oscar Branch Colquitt, who was sworn in as Governor of Texas in 1911. In 1912, Meusebach–Zesch approached Governor Colquitt for a state appointment. He required her to submit a petition signed by citizens of the Mason area recommending her for the position. She saw his response as gender-motivated, and decided it was time to move on to visit her sister and brother-in-law in Alaska. On the way, she decided to stop in Winslow Arizona for a visit with friends.
Arizona 1912–1915.
Meusebach–Zesch kept an office in Winslow once she became licensed by the state of Arizona. She held mobile dental clinics in remote locations, traveling across the state in her Model T touring car, with her equipment and instruments hooked on the back of the vehicle. She treated all school age children free of charge. Many patients journeyed to her Winslow office from other areas. En route with her mother to a sightseeing adventure at Petrified Forest National Monument, she was tracked down by a patient needing immediate treatment. They unpacked her equipment, and she worked on the patient on the open road, before continuing with her sightseeing agenda. After treating Hopi and Navajo patients in Walpi, Meusebach–Zesch and her mother attended a traditional Hopi Snake Dance, a ceremony in which the Hopi believe the snakes carry their pleas for rain to the appropriate deities.
Alaska 1915–1930.
Cordova and the interior.
In December 1915 after living in Winslow for three years, Meusebach–Zesch visited her sister and brother-in-law in the Territory of Alaska, with the intent of returning to her practice in Arizona. The "Second Organic Act of 1912" had created the Territory of Alaska out of land the United States had purchased from Russia in 1867. Meusebach–Zesch spent that Christmas with her sister and brother-in-law in Cordova, Alaska. In February 1916, she substituted for vacationing Cordova dentist C. W. Hale. She began to realize that Alaska's need for dentists could be a lucrative career decision.
Meusebach–Zesch wanted to see Alaska's interior while mulling over her professional future. She arranged with the Alaska Commercial Company to carry her as a passenger on its mail delivery. She began aboard a freight train in Cordova. The mode of transportation and drivers changed several times with the weather and circumstances. Through Chitina, Copper Center, Delta, Gulkana, Paxson, Donnelly and McCarthy, she rode by horseback, on wagons, forded through ice at the Tanana River, and was taken through the Salcha River in a native hewn craft. On dog sleds, she was strapped in for stability, and once rolled down a hill when the sled detached. They stopped at numerous roadhouses, which in Alaska served the same purpose as an inn or stagecoach stop in other states. They provided food, shelter and basic necessities. One of the roadhouses was at Richardson, 70 miles southeast of Fairbanks. Named for Wilds P. Richardson, the community had a population of a few hundred people, and the roadhouse was run by Fred Wilkins. Twenty-four days after the trip began in Cordova, they arrived in Fairbanks.
After visiting a gold mine near Fairbanks, she completed her trip with a boat ride along the Yukon River and explored the Yukon Territory. At the trip's end, Meusebach–Zesch had decided to move to Alaska.
Sabbatical and move to Anchorage.
She took temporary leave from Alaska to do post-graduate work at Northwestern University in Chicago in 1918, and survived an influenza bout while in San Francisco. The global 1918 flu pandemic killed an estimated 30–50 million. The pandemic spread to Alaska in the fall of 1918, and lasted until the spring of 1919. Hoping to stem the spread, Governor Thomas Riggs, Jr. imposed a maritime quarantine on the territory. The Inuit population was hard hit, partially due to preferring traditional medicines and, and partially from fear of western hospitals. In some cases, entire communities were decimated. Dr. Hale in Cordova died as a result of the pandemic, and Meusebach–Zesch purchased his equipment for her office. When copper mining began to decline in Cordova, she moved her practice to Anchorage where she also began to work with the local PTA to improve dental care for children. In 1923, she closed her Anchorage practice to study at Columbia University in New York through the end of 1924. Following her university studies, Meusebach–Zesch vacationed in Europe and Egypt before returning to Alaska.
Nome, remote Inuit villages, near-death experiences.
Meusebach–Zesch's goal in 1925 was to mine for gold in Nome. She had a legal agreement with the existing claims owner to mine his claim in exchange for paying $500 for assessment, and $20,000 in royalties. She hired a Mr. Johnson to do the actual mining for her. No gold was found, and the owner of the claims sued her. She believed Mr. Johnson had been working a scheme with the owner. Her only other means of income was to open a dental practice in Nome.
She began conducting mobile dental clinics as she had in Arizona, and was put in charge of dental care for children in Inuit villages. She had a custom 16-foot sled built and hired Mr. Johnson, of the failed mining venture, as dog musher. She felt his labor would help repay what she lost in the lawsuit. Their route took them through Cape Nome, Solomon, Bluffs, White Mountain School, Moses, Dime Creek, and Candle, each village giving her a welcoming all-night party. Meusebach–Zesch stayed in Kotzebue for a month. At Noorvik they stayed overnight with an Inuit family in a barabara, a semisubterranean sod housing. Kiana was the final clinic. Returning, they witnessed the aurora borealis at Kotzebue, and spent the night at a barabara built inside a snow bank. Half the dog team fell through the ice near Cape Douglas, and Johnson advised leaving them to drown. Meusebach–Zesch crawled flat on her abdomen across the thin ice herself to save the dogs.
Meusebach–Zesch serviced Inuit on Little Diomede Island, Saint Lawrence Island, King Island, Cape Prince of Wales. Chartering a plane to Point Barrow in 1929, she survived a crash and walked partway to Kotzebue before being transported by an Inuit whose water craft was pulled along by his dogs on the beach.
In March 1928, Meusebach–Zesch and her assistant Mrs. Cheney scheduled dental clinics at the White Mountain School for Inuit children, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Mission at Pilgrim Hot Springs, and in Council. Because of the lateness of the season and expected break-up of ice and snow, Meusebach–Zesch had trouble finding dogs for the sled, and was unable to hire a man to mush the dogs. She and Mrs. Cheney set off alone with a dog team. Between Cape Nome and Solomon Roadhouse, a blizzard left Meusebach–Zesch snow blind and bedridden for a week. After they completed all scheduled work, they were advised against traveling back to Nome in the inclement conditions. Dire predictions turned to reality when they found themselves stranded, an estimated 30 miles from Nome. The dogs had given up, and they were not even able to make it to the nearest roadhouse. Meusebach–Zesch had begun to believe they might die. Leonhard Seppala, known for winning multiple-year dog sled races, and for participating in the 1925 serum run to Nome, had been alerted about the women's hazardous trek. He hired a caterpillar tractor to search for them, rescuing the women on March 31, 1928.
California 1930–1944.
In 1930, Meusebach–Zesch returned to California. In 1931 she accompanied her mother to Texas for her mother's recuperation from an illness. Leaving her mother in Texas, she returned to Oakland. The Great Depression was in full swing, and she did not feel there would be sufficient new patients who could afford her services. She met Carl Rhodehamel and joined the Unemployed Exchange Association (UXA), offering her dental services on an exchange basis. The UXA was organized July 20, 1932, in Oakland by unemployed electrical engineer Rhodehamel. The concept behind the organization was for the unemployed to help each other through a type of bartering system. Instead of working for money, they worked for points that would be traded for services of other members in the organization. Meusebach–Zesch remained a member of the UXA until at least 1934, commuting to semi-monthly meetings during breaks from her work with the Civilian Conservation Corps.
The state of California instituted a labor program in 1931 to ease unemployment by creating labor camps purposed toward improving and protecting the state's forests and watershed areas. Volunteers received food, shelter and clothing in return for their services. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) with Executive Order 6106. The CCC employed men ages 17 through 28 creating infrastructure, working with the United States Forest Service to fight fires and plant trees, and creating and improving parks. In California, three million young men of the CCC spent nine years improving the state's environment and creating most of the state's park system. In return, they received $30 a month and an education.
In 1933, Meusebach–Zesch and her mother moved to Railroad Flat in Calaveras County, at the suggestion of her mother's doctor. Meusebach–Zesch worked out an arrangement with the CCC to provide on-site dental services to the young laborers at the Calaveras camps in Rich Gulch and Angel's Camp, as well as Bear River in Amador County. The government paid for emergency services, and the men paid for their own non-emergency services. For the next four years, she performed dental services on an estimated 4,000 young men. During these years, she also serviced unemployment camps and school children. When it became apparent that the CCC would enlist the services of the Dental Reserve Corps, eliminating the need for her services, she appealed directly to Major McCrystal, head of the CCC in San Francisco. She was turned down, based on her gender.
On July 2, 1937, Meusebach–Zesch became dentist for the California Institute for Women at Tehachapi, and operated a private practice in the same city. She provided dentistry to migrant laborers through the Public Works Administration, and to convict labor camps through the California highway department.
Death.
Elizabeth von Meusebach–Zesch died in 1943 at age 81. Leonie died in Oakland on July 7, 1944, at age 61. Leota Zesch Gillis died in 1979 at age 93. All three women are buried in a single grave in the Marschall–Meusebach Cemetery in Cherry Spring, Texas. In 2012, Leonie was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.

Paul Atherton

Paul Atherton (born 20 March 1968) is managing director of Simple (TV) Productions and its sister not-for-profit company, Q&D Productions Limited. He is the first producer/ director to have his work broadcast on the Coca-Cola billboard in Piccadilly Circus, London with his film "The Ballet of Change".
Early life.
Paul Atherton was three months old when he was abandoned in a tent at a disused Airport in Cardiff. He was placed with a white foster family in the small village of Ystrad Mynach, he left home at 15 where he spent time in children's homes and completed his "O" Levels. At 16 he set up home on his own, against the wishes of Social Services. After a traumatic event at the age of 18 he became homeless and lived on the streets, but by 20 he'd recovered his life and bought his first flat.
At the age of 16 Atherton was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, often called myalgic encephalomyelitis in the United Kingdom). and still suffers today
He attended Cardiff Business School, and obtained a BSc Honours Degree in Business Administration as a mature student in 1994.
Whilst studying he set up a mail order company specialising in silk lingerie called "A Touch of Silk". This was the first non-blue-chip company in the UK allowed to take credit cards over the phone without a retail premises.
He moved onto a career in Public Relations with Systems Publicity, Harvard Communications and finally Propeller Marketing where he Account Directed clients CNN, media buyers OMD (Omnicom Media Directions) and The Daily Telegraph.

On Sunday 2 August 2009 Atherton started Pre-production on "A Thousand Voices for a Broken System" a new format of documentary film that will originally take place on the Web and eventually be edited for cinema.
Prompted by his own experiences the premise of the film is to interview a 1,000 people from across the UK who have been failed by the Welfare, NHS or Social Services in the past 10 years, in order to highlight the issues of the most vulnerable people in society.
It's referred to as a patchwork film because rather than one film-maker doing all the interviews, documentary crews from around the UK have been asked to submit their own interviews with subjects of their choice, so Atherton can sew them together like a patchwork quilt.
On Monday 6 September 2010 Atherton announced that he had signed video games writer Rhianna Pratchett to write his first feature film. Vigilia (a working title) is due to shoot in 2013

Waveform (video game)

Waveform is an action, puzzle game created by indie developer Eden Industries. You control a wave of light as it transmits through space and you’re able to modify the wave’s amplitude and wavelength to line it up with objectives, avoid obstacles, and interact with a slew of objects that affect the path of your wave, and the world around you, in interesting ways
Waveform is the debut game of Eden Industries, a six man team. Eden Industries tried to gain funding via Kickstarter on November 9, 2011 and were asking for $8,000. The funding ended on January 3, 2012. They only reached $3,763 and therefore was unsuccessful.
Gameplay.
In Waveform, you control a particle of light on a mission from the outer reaches of the solar system to the sun. Instead of controlling the particle directly, you change the amplitude and frequency of its wave pattern with the mouse. Stretch and shrink its path to collect photons, avoid dark matter, and go through light gates to increase your multiplier and your score.
As you progress through the solar system, you encounter mirrors, wormholes, asteroids, gas clouds, fireworks, and particle accelerators that can change your path, clear away obstacles, or destroy you outright. The photon path also becomes trickier, forcing you to change your wavelength mid-arc to collect them and avoid damage.
Some stages require a certain number of stars to unlock; you earn stars by improving your score on previous levels.
Reception.
"Waveform" was generally well received by both critics and gamers upon release, garnering an average critic score of 81 from 8 reviews on Metacritic.

Trilinear polarity

In geometry, trilinear polarity is a certain correspondence between the points in the plane of a triangle not lying on the sides of the triangle and lines in the plane of the triangle not passing through the vertices of the triangle. "Although it is called a polarity, it is not really a polarity at all, for poles of concurrent lines are not collinear lines." It was Poncelet (1788 – 1867), a French engineer and mathematician, who introduced the idea of the trilinear polar of a point in 1865.
Definitions.
Let "ABC" be a plane triangle and let "P" be any point in the plane of the triangle not lying
on the sides of the triangle. Briefly, the trilinear polar of "P" is the axis of perspectivity of the cevian triangle of "P" and the triangle "ABC".
In detail, let the line "AP", "BP", "CP" meet the sideliness "BC", "CA", "AB" at "D", "E", "F" respectively. Triangle "DEF" is the cevian triangle of "P" with reference to triangle "ABC". Let the pairs of line ("BC", "EF"), ("CA", "FD"), ("DE", "AB") intersect at "X", "Y", "Z" respectively. By Desargues' theorem the points "X", "Y", "Z" are collinear. The line of collinearity is the axis of prespectivity of triangle "ABC" and triangle "DEF". The line "XYZ" is the trilinear polar of the point "P".
The points "X", "Y", "Z" can also be obtained as the harmonic conjugates of "D", "E", "F" with respect to the pairs of points ("B","C"), ("C", "A"), ("A", "B") respectively. Poncelet used this idea to define the concept of trilinear polars.
If the line "L" is the trilinear polar of the point "P" with respect to the reference triangle "ABC" then "P" is called the trilinear pole of the line "L" with respect to the reference triangle "ABC".
Trilinear equation.
Let the trilinear coordinates of the point "P" be ("p" : "q" : "r"). Then the trilinear equation of the trilinear polar of "P" is 
Construction of the trilinear pole.
Let the line "L" meet the sides "BC", "CA", "AB" of triangle "ABC" at "X", "Y", "Z" respectively. Let the pairs of lines ("BY", "CZ"), ("CZ", "AX"), ("AX", "BY") 
meet at "U", "V", "W". Triangles "ABC" and "UVW" are in perspective and let "P" be the center of perspectivity. "P" is the trilinear pole of the line "L".
Some trilinear polars.
Some of the trilinear polars are well known. 
Poles of pencils of lines.
Let "P" with trilinear coordinates ( "X" : "Y" : "Z" ) be the pole of a line passing through a fixed point "K" with trilinear coordinates ( "x"0 : "y"0 : "z"0 ). Equation of the line is 
Since this passes through "K",
Thus the locus of "P" is 
This is a circumconic of the triangle of reference "ABC". Thus the locus of the poles of a pencil of lines passing through a fixed point is a circumconic of the triangle of rederence.

New York's Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision

New York's Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision (BPSS) oversees and monitors non-degree granting proprietary schools in New York. The Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision (BPSS) is part of the New York State Education Department (NYSED).
Bureau Structure.
The bureau was established to oversee educational quality of non-degree granting schools in the state of New York, including trade and business schools, English Second Language Schools (ESL), and others. Most of these schools are geared towards the adult population, providing education and job training.
The Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision provides licenses to these proprietary schools and teachers so the programs offered meet state standards. All segments of a school’s operation are reviewed including financial standing, ownership structure, personnel, teaching methods, and marketing materials. The bureau has only 20 staff members to cover 500 schools, which has led to criticism for their ability to adequately manage schools. The bureau works together with local, state, and federal organizations to review the safety and equipment of all the schools. This includes investigations into student complaints, and reviews of schools to ensure compliance with Education Law and Commissioner's Regulations.
Licensing.
In order to be licensed as a proprietary school within New York, organizations must go through a licensing process where they submit various documents, including: an application for a school license, proof of type of ownership (e.g. sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation). financial documents, curriculum applications, and school prepared forms.
Controversy.
In 2009, the New York's Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision abruptly changed its policy on regulating yoga studio training and threatened them with a criminal fine of up to $50,000, although the department noted that they had received zero complaints about subpar yoga training. Up until that point, no yoga studio in the state had ever applied for or received a license to train future yoga instructors, which was the alleged crime. Yoga studios were forced to go through a "nightmarish" application process which put some smaller yoga studios at risk of shutting down permanently since the process could take up to a year. The initiative was criticized and the Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision was forced to abandon this tactic after New York Governor David Paterson signed a bill into law exempting yoga studios from the licensing process.

The Atlantic Cup

The Atlantic Cup is the first and only dedicated Class40 professional sailing race in the United States. It consists of both offshore and inshore legs and was created by Manuka Sports Event Management, which is headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island.
Hugh Piggin, a New Zealand native and sailor who lives in Newport, was intent on changing the face of sailing in the United States. After joining forces with Julianna Barbieri, a sports broadcasting professional, the two created a business plan that would eventually form the Atlantic Cup.
The first edition of the race was in 2011. Entrants started in New York City and finished in Newport, with an additional inshore series that was also held in Newport. The race expanded in 2012 to start from Charleston, South Carolina.
The Atlantic Cup competition has three stages. The first stage is a 648 nautical mile double-handed leg from Charleston to New York City. The second stage is a 231 nautical mile leg from New York City to Newport. Double-handed racing is vital to the race because of its ability to make the sport "more attractive and appealing to the masses." The third and final stage is sailed with a maximum crew of six for a weekend-long inshore series in Newport. Points are awarded for each race, and the team with the least amount of overall combined points from both the offshore and inshore series is crowned Atlantic Cup Champion. The total prize purse for the race is $30,000, with $15,000 awarded to the winning crew.
The 2012 race was the first carbon neutral sailing race in the United States. To achieve carbon neutrality, race organizers adopted a 3-part approach: on-land, on-water, and education. On land, single-use plastic water bottles are prohibited. Only glassware or biodegradable cups are used, and recycle stations and water filtration systems for both crew members and guests alike are set up in all three race locations. Event management uses only "100% post-consumer recycled paper" that is utilized for the printing of collateral material such as event packets, tickets, and handouts.
The on-water component of the race requires all boats to use some form of alternative energy to minimize their fossil fuel engine use. Teams use either a hydrogenerator, fuel cell, or solar panels. Teams are also provided with sustainable fuel from waste vegetable oil from Newport Biodiesel. The biodiesel creates an 80/20 blend in the boat engines for instances in which engine use is necessary.
In 2012, Green Mountain Energy conducted a pre and post-race assessment to determine the carbon footprint of The Atlantic Cup. Based on calculations in the pre-assessment, carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates (RECs) were retired in order to offset emissions associated with the event, such as staff air travel, ground and water transportation, staff hotel stays, and event electricity usage. In the post-race assessment, it was concluded that the event generated 15,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. The dollar costs designated to those emissions were used toward financial support of wind power.

Elacatinus evelynae

Elacatinus evelynae, the Sharknose goby, is a species of goby native to the Western Atlantic Ocean from the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles to the northern coast of South America, as well as the Antilles and western Caribbean.
Appearance.
"Elacatinus evelynae" are very small, torpedo-shaped fish. They can reach a maximum length of . They have a yellow stripe in front of each eye that joins to form a V near the tip of their snout. Black strips run under the yellow ones from the snout, over the lower part of the eye to the end of the caudal fin. "E. evelynae's" fin configuration is the same as all other gobies. Their dorsal fin is split in two, with a rounded anterior fin and a flat posterior fin which lines up with their anal fin. The pectoral fins are almost circular. All their fins are transparent.
Habitat.
They inhabit coral reefs in clear ocean waters at a depth of . The reported temperature range where they are found is to .
Diet.
"E. evelynae" is a cleaner fish as indicated by one of its common names, the Caribbean cleaning goby. They feed on ectoparasites found on other fish. Females tend to clean and feed more than males especially if they are accompanied by a large male, which may be due to mate guarding and the male spending more time guarding the eggs.
Reproduction.
They are monogamous and are usually found in pairs near coral heads. Both males and females will show aggression towards potential intruders of the same sex in order to protect their mate. Attempts to breed them in captivity have show that they will not produce eggs unless there is optimal condition, with little to no fluctuation in temperature and salinity.

Brian Copenhaver

Brian P. Copenhaver (born December 21, 1942) is a Professor of Philosophy and History at The University of California, Los Angeles, teaching and writing about philosophy, religion and science in late medieval and early modern Europe. He studies magic and related beliefs and practices - astrology, demonology, divination, Kabbalah - as parts of normative philosophy and science as they were a few centuries ago. His research shows that magic and other 'occult' beliefs and practices were supported primarily by the philosophy and science of Aristotle and Aristotelian scholasticism, which dominated European culture from the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries. When confidence in Aristotelianism collapsed in the seventeenth century, magic and its attendant beliefs collapsed with it as serious issues for Europe's leading thinkers.
Copenhaver also studies the ancient Greek and Latin "Hermetica", writings from late antiquity ascribed by Renaissance scholars to an ancient Egyptian god, Thoth, whose Greek name is Hermes Trismegistus. Although this legendary Hermes has often been identified as a divine patron of magic, Copenhaver has shown that the Greek Hermetic texts recovered in the fifteenth century by Marsilio Ficino are not about magic: their topic is a religious practice aiming at personal salvation.
Copenhaver's work on Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Lorenzo Valla, both famed as 'Renaissance humanists,' goes in two very different directions: Pico as the inventor of Christian Kabbalah; Valla as the scourge of scholastic logic. Copenhaver shows that Pico's famous "Oration on the Dignity of Man" is not about the dignity of man. (Pico did not give it that title.) Instead, the speech is a manifesto for ascetic mysticism, urging the pious to abandon the body and escape the material world through magic and Kabbalah. Like Pico, Valla was a master of the Latin language and an acute student of philosophy. Unlike Pico, Valla had little influence on his time and place through the work that Copenhaver has studied, the "Dialectical Disputations", whose main target is Peter of Spain's "Summary of Logic", written in the thirteenth century but still Europe's leading textbook of logic when Valla wrote his "Disputations". Although Valla's contemporaries paid little attention to it, his "Disputations" foreshadows what we now call 'philosophy of language'.
Both Valla and Pico lived during a great era of Italian intellectual life, starting with Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio in the fourteenth century and ending with Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella and Galileo in the seventeenth century. In the nineteenth century, Italian philosophers worked out the grand narrative of Italian thought in this earlier period - the Renaissance - and afterward: the construction of this story as an artifact of modern Italian politics, especially the Risorgimento and the Fascist regime, is another topic that Copenhaver has explored.
Copenhaver was educated at Loyola College (Baltimore), Creighton University and The University of Kansas, before doing post-doctoral studies at the Warburg Institute. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, past President of the "Journal of the History of Philosophy" and a member of the Council of the Instituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento in Italy. He serves or has served on the boards of "Renaissance Quarterly", "Annals of Science", the "Journal of the History of Ideas", "Early Science and Medicine", the "International Archives of the History of Ideas", and the "I Tatti Renaissance Library". He was the charter co-editor of "Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft". His research has been supported by the Guggenheim Foundation, the Getty Trust, the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Philosophical Society, the Medieval Academy of America and by a Fulbright Scholarship.
Contributions to Higher Education.
During his ten years as Provost of UCLA’s College of Letters and Science, Copenhaver led successful efforts to revamp UCLA’s General Education curriculum, implement a stronger writing requirement and make the Internet and Web technology an integral part of academic life for students and faculty. He was also instrumental in the College’s fund-raising campaign, raising five times more than the previous capital campaign. On his watch, UCLA’s College became the first in the country to establish a website – supported by student fees – for every undergraduate course. In response to 9/11, he worked with Vice-Provost Judi Smith to design the first offering of UCLA’s renowned Fiat Lux courses, and to recruit faculty to teach them on short notice. Copenhaver is currently teaching his own online course, while advising other faculty and staff about this new – and controversial – way to teach and learn.
Published Works.
Copenhaver's articles examine magic, astrology, the Hermetica, Kabbalah and their foundations in Neoplatonic, Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy; natural philosophy; scepticism; Averroism; philosophical translation; modern Italian philosophy; historiography; the classical tradition in philosophy; Lorenzo Valla; Marsilio Ficino; Giovanni Pico della Mirandola; Polydore Vergil; Tommaso Campanella; Isaac Newton; Henry More; and Benedetto Croce.

Gary Plauche

Leon "Gary" Plauche (born November 10, 1945) is a native citizen of Louisiana, best known for the 1984 killing of Jeff Doucet, who had kidnapped and sexually assaulted his son, Jody Plauche. The killing occurred on Friday, March 16, 1984, and it was captured on camera by a news television crew. Although Plauche shot and killed Doucet, he was given five years probation for the shooting and received no jail time. The case received wide publicity due to the fact that many people questioned whether Plauche should be charged for murder or be let off. Plauche claims to believe to this day that he was in the right, and that those in a similar position would have done the same thing.
Shooting.
Plauche lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was separated from his wife June at the time of the shooting. In 1984, his eleven-year-old son, Jody Plauche, was taking karate lessons. Jody's karate instructor was twenty-five-year-old Jeffrey Doucet, and had been sexually abusing Jody for at least a year. In February 1984, Doucet kidnapped Jody and took him to a motel in California where he sexually assaulted and molested Jody. Police searched the country for Jody and he was eventually found after Doucet made a phone call to his mother from the motel. California police raided the motel and made the arrest without incident. On March 1, 1984, Jody was returned to his family in Louisiana safely, but Gary, who was thirty-eight at the time, was coping with reports that Doucet had sexually assaulted his son. In an interview with a news television crew, Gary described that he didn't know what to do and just felt helpless. Ten days later on Friday, March 16, 1984, Doucet was flown back from California to Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, also known as Ryan Field, to face trial. Doucet arrived and was led in handcuffs by police officers through the airport, at around 9:30PM Central Time. Unbeknownst to everyone else, Gary Plauche was waiting for Doucet with a gun. Plauche was friends with several high-ranked police officers in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana Police Department and while many people believed that such friends told Plauche where and when Doucet would be arriving, it was actually a member of the TV news station WBRZ who gave Plauche the information. A news television crew was also waiting for Doucet and had set up their cameras to record Doucet's arriving. Opposite the news crew were a row of pay telephones, which is where Plauche stood, talking to his best friend. He had a white cap on his head and sun glasses on, so no one recognized him. As Doucet was escorted through the airport, he passed the television crew who were recording the entire incident. He then walked past Plauche, who took out his gun and fired a single shot, directly at the right side of Doucet's head, from point-blank range. Doucet fell to the floor instantly, and Plauche placed the gun down before officers grabbed hold of him.
Aftermath.
The entire incident was captured on camera. Officials grabbed hold of Plauche and recognized who he was at once. They kept him pinned against the wall, asking him as captured on camera, "Gary, why? Why, Gary?" Doucet died of his gunshot immediately and is believed to have actually died even before hitting the ground. After the incident, Plauche was originally charged with second-degree murder, but after bargaining with prosecutors, he pleaded no contest to manslaughter. In the end, he was sentenced to five years probation and 300 hours of community service work, which he completed in 1989. Psychological reports helped Plauche's case after it was found out that Doucet had abused Jody Plauche months prior to the kidnapping. Doctor Edward P. Uzee examined Gary Plauche and determined that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong when he killed Doucet. A voice inside Plauche's head was telling him that he had to kill Doucet or else he would continue to abuse and harm his son. He also found out that Doucet had the ability to manipulate others and took advantage of the fact that Gary was separated from his wife June at the time, and had managed to wedge his way into the Plauche family. Judge Frank Saia determined that sending Plauche to jail would not help anyone, and that there was virtually no risk of him committing another crime.
The video of Plauche killing Doucet has been featured on many shock television programs and documentaries. It most famously appeared in Bowling for Columbine and Traces of Death. The footage has also been uploaded to YouTube and the video has received more than 12.7 million views. As of 2005, Jody Plauche travels around the United States giving talks to people about sexual violence and speaking out against it. He provides support and help for victims of sexual abuse. To this day, Gary Plauche maintains and stands by his actions.

Ulrich Hensel

Ulrich Hensel (born 1946) is a German visual artist known for his large format colour photographs of construction sites.
Education.
He was born in Düsseldorf in 1946 and studied psychology, art and film. Ulrich Hensel did a number of different series of works (e.g. Middle East and North Africa, 1967-1975, India, 1981-1990, local deities in North and in South India, 1995-1997) but since 1991 he has been focusing on images of construction sites.
Career and style.
While not being formally associated with the Düsseldorf School of Photography the serial character of Ulrich Hensel’s images and his similarly methodical approach suggests certain parallels to the school of Bernd and Hilla Becher. Andreas Gursky, with whom for some time he shared a flat, is said to be a fan of his work. Gurskys famous image Gasherd from 1980 was shot in their flat. However, Hensel’s oeuvre is viewed as occupying a unique place among the photographic art to come out of Germany. 
For nearly two decades, Ulrich Hensel has been working almost obsessively focussing on one single subject: construction sites. His images are often abstract and sometimes minimalist – “grids, dots, fastenings and iron grilles extend across the pictures in rigorous formations defined by the functions of the objects shown” – and inevitably create associations with the geometric abstract art of Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian.
“Hensel’s works have the feeling of extended three-dimensional object modelling in a kind of crossover between photography, painting, object, and installation art, imperfection caught as if by chance in a perfect moment.”. 
In contrast to Andreas Gursky, who in recent years has been heavily relying on computers to edit and enhance his pictures, Hensel is concerned with authenticity and avoids digital manipulations. His large-format photographs are described as “unobtrusive and complex at the same time”.
Art market.
Most of Hensel’s photos come in editions of six with one artist’s proof. He is represented by Sprüth Magers Munich Berlin London in Europe.

Major Israel McCreight

Major Israel McCreight (Oglala Lakota: "Cante Tanke" ("Great Heart")(Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka) in Standard Lakota Orthography) (April 22, 1865 – October 13, 1958) is notable in American history as a Progressive Era banker, conservationist and expert on Native American culture and policy. McCreight was a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association, and authored President Theodore Roosevelt’s conservation policy on public education and Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark. McCreight dedicated his life to public education about Native American culture and was a nominee for U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs. McCreight’s relationship with the Lakota people began as a young man in the Dakota Territory in 1885 when he lived with them during a period of great sorrow. He returned to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, became a successful banker, and led the region into prominence as the biggest bituminous coal producers in the United States between 1890 and World War I. McCreight collaborated with Flying Hawk, an Oglala Lakota Chief, to write an Native American’s view of U.S. history and classic accounts of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse and commentaries on Native American philosophy. The Wigwam, McCreight’s home in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was a Native American heritage center and once the Eastern home of Oglala Lakota ""Oskate Wicasa"" Wild Westers. McCreight was a founder of the Pennsylvania Banker’s Association and member of the Pennsylvania Society of New York. McCreight was an ardent student of the Indian, a lover of fair play and an author of books and articles.
Early years.
Major Israel McCreight was born April 17, 1865, on a farm in Paradise, Winslow Township, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania and raised with siblings by pioneer parents John Winslow McCreight and Eliza Uncapher McCreight. The name “Major” was a nickname given to Israel as a child and he preferred to be called “Maj”, “Maje” or simply “MI.” At age 16, McCreight attended Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, to learn accounting and banking. After graduation, he returned to Du Bois, Pennsylvania and entered the banking profession as a night clerk and assistant cashier.
Devil’s Lake Dakota Territory.
In 1885, the twenty-one-year-old McCreight seeking adventure took the Northern Pacific Railway to its farthest point west, Devils Lake, Dakota Territory. McCreight’s two years in the Dakota Territory were filled with classic Wild West adventures. He was immediately hired by a livestock business supplying food to local Indian tribes and the U.S Army garrison at Fort Totten, North Dakota. At Fort Totten, McCreight met with Indians trading buffalo bones to be sold as fertilizer in the lucrative St. Louis market.
Arrival at Devils Lake.
McCreight began his lifelong kinship with Native Americans in Devils Lake. The first persons to meet and greet him as he stepped down from the platform of the train was a small band of Sioux. "They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket looked about for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: "How cola!" Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town. He passed by a large pile of bones, and wondered what it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forbears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.”
Chief Little Shell.
Known as the “Indian Man” because of his friendships,
McCreight prevented a confrontation between the 7th Cavalry Regiment and aggrieved Ojibwe from Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell’s Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers. McCreight was the “Indian man” in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor woke him before sunrise saying: "Get up quick, the Indians are out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, and see what you can do with them!" McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, “ It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General George Armstrong Custer's troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to intercede for and protect the rights of these abused natives.”
James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway.
McCreight also worked for James J. Hill the legendary “ Empire Builder” of the Great Northern Railway. Hill’s vision included the introduction of cattle into the Great Plains to replace the buffalo as a food source, fatten them in the West, and ship them back to the East. Hill began his cattle promotion with the ‘Great Fat Stock Show’, July 4, 1886 in Devil's Lake, then the far western terminus of the Great Northern Railway. The Great Fat Stock Show was a gala midsummer fair of bronco-busting, horse races, Indian war dances and festivities. Hill needed someone with banking experience to manage the show, and McCreight was “commandeered” by to serve as “ticket seller, money counter and banker.” The show was a success, and Hill later invited McCreight to shovel the dirt to lay the first railroad tie to the Great Northern Railway transcontinental system from Devils Lake to Seattle, Washington.
Chief Wa-na-ta.
McCreight became friends with many Native Americans and Chief Wa-na-ta (Waanatan II) visited McCreight’s office regularly to smoke tobacco. McCreight was impressed with the old chief’s dignity and bearing. “One day he signed that he wished a private interview, when he drew from his blanket a package which he exhibited as something he held more precious than any other treasure. It was carefully wrapped in old newspaper, and after it had been divested of the strings and unrolled to be read, it proved to be the parchment or treaty with Government officials, his own name inscribed as head or Grand Chief. Having thus established his old-day tribal office, he carefully refolded the document, wrapped it in the faded news sheet and returned it to the inner folds of his blanket, then nimbly squatted on the office floor, filled his pipe and enjoyed his usual half-hour smoke.” Chief Wa-na-ta’s smoking pipe was his most precious possession. “A titled English ranch-owner who knew of his importance in history offered any price that the old chief would name for the pipe and pouch, but the chief disdained to listen to any offer of money. But when I squatted beside him on the floor, where he was puffing meditatively on his long red-stone pipe, to tell him of leaving next week for a trip west, he arose instantly, untied his belt, laid both pouch and pipe across his left hand and extended it to me as a present and token to be preserved after he had passed to the long sleep.” McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.
First Citizen of Du Bois.
In 1886, McCreight returned to Du Bois, Pennsylvania from the Dakota Territory and accepted a position as assistant cashier and director of the First National Bank. McCreight maintained relationships with friends in the Dakotas, and among them was the legendary U.S. Army Scout, Colonel William Frederick “Buffalo Bill” Cody.
In 1886 Buffalo Bill, accompanied by Oglala companions from his Wild West, passed through Du Bois on the way home to North Platte, Nebraska. After meeting McCreight’s childhood sweetheart Alice Humphrey, Cody prompted for an immediate wedding, and McCreight and Alice were married in July, 1887.
On June 4, 1888, seeing opportunity to manage his own bank, McCreight purchased the Du Bois Deposit Bank. However, just two weeks later a catastrophic fire raged out of control in the center of the town’s wooden structures. McCreight joined a bucket brigade to fight the inferno but the new bank was destroyed. Fortunately, the contents of the safe were recovered and McCreight quickly resumed banking operations.
By 1898, Du Bois Deposit Bank was the only bank in town and McCreight was the treasurer, secretary or director of most local institutions and businesses. McCreight was a “One-man Chamber of Commerce” and partnered diverse business enterprises.
He successfully acquired land in north central Pennsylvania for coal and railroad interests, and brought the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad and the Erie Railroad to Du Bois. McCreight led the Du Bois region into prominence as the biggest bituminous coal producer in the United States between 1890 and World War I.
McCreight was also “First Citizen of Du Bois”. He led the development of light-rail transportation, public electricity, a public water system and other urban infrastructure, and held leadership positions with the school board, draft board and local board of trade. McCreight was a founder of the Pennsylvania Banker’s Association and a member of the Pennsylvania Society of New York.
Unexpected visitors.
Buffalo Bill and his Wild West was back in Du Bois in September 1901. At this time McCreight lived in his townhouse, and had not yet moved to The Wigwam. “At the opening of the 20th Century a crowd of twelve Oglala Lakota came to spend the evening with the writer. Besides Chief Lone Bear, Chief Flying Hawk was in the party. The yard outside was covered with neighbors, big and little, who had seen them come, arrayed in their war bonnets, beaded regalia and gay plumes of eagle quills, as they climbed to and spread over the wide veranda and swung open their richly covered blankets. It was a surprises visit from old-time western friends. Don eldest son was quickly dispatched for cigars, fruit and candy, with a large market basket and instructions to deliver the same to the back door, and to apportion the supplies, and pass them around when the Indians got seated inside. Don was thirteen, and full of business. At the proper time, he appeared from the kitchen with both arms full, a cigar for each man on the platter, and another with candy, bananas, oranges and grapes. He set the fruit basket on a table in the outer room, and proceeded to pass the cigars, beginning with the big chief. As he modestly handed the platter to the chief to take one cigar, the whole dozen or more were scooped from the plate and quickly stored within his blanket. The boy was “game,” and went back his kitchen stores and brought another supply, and went on passing them to the others-one at a time.” “Chief Lone Bear noticed a pair of boxing gloves on the floor and signed to the writer to explain. They belonged to the twins, aged five, more signals, indicated he wanted to see them box. The two boys stood with open eyes gazing at the strange people, and it took a little coaxing to get the boys to put on the gloves. But they, too, were game, and came to dad to have them tied on. All smiles, the visitors spread their chairs, through the arch into the big parlor, so as to form a large area, for the bout. Dad called “time” and the boys went to it rough and tumble. They immediately forgot their modesty and the audience. No fight in the prize rings of New York or Boston, ever witnessed better sparring. It was a battle to the finish; bloody noses and howls of laughter from the Indians all the while it lasted. When they were exhausted, and their dad stopped the fight, the old chief ordered that they both be adopted into the tribe, as worthy of membership in "The Nation of the Fighting Sioux."
The Wigwam.
The Wigwam, McCreight’s home in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was part of a 1,300 acre estate with heavily forested lands. The Wigwam sits at 2,140 feet atop Prospect Knob in Sandy Township, Clearfeld County, Pennsylvania, near the Goschgoschink Path where the Great Divide of the Alleghenies was once visible 18 miles to the East. The Wigwam is located in the wilds of north central Pennsylvania and once had an electric beacon for navigation of New York to San Francisco Air Mail flyers. The Wigwam was once considered for development as a Pennsylvania State Park.
The Wigwam was a well-spring of images and narratives of Oglala Lakota Wild Westers during the early 20th century. The Wigwam was a retreat for Progressive Era politicians, businessmen, journalists and adventurers; the Eastern home of Oglala Lakota ""Oskate Wicasa""; Chief Flying Hawk’s second home for 30 years and a Native American heritage center. Du Bois, Pennsylvania, a northcentral railroad hub on the Eastern Continental divide, had two active passenger rail stations, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania Railroad, and was always a welcome rest stop for weary travelers. For “Old Scouts” Col. William F. “Buffalo Bill” Cody, Robert Edmund Strahorn and Captain Jack Crawford, from the Great Sioux War, the Wigwam was a place to relax, smoke and talk about the Old West. The Old Scouts were adventurers and masters of American Wild West images and narratives.
Wild Westers needed a place to relax, and The Wigwam was a warm and welcome home where Indians could be Indians, sleep in buffalo skins and tipis, walk in the woods, have a hearty breakfast, smoke their pipes and tell of their stories and deeds. On one occasion 150 Indians with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West camped in the forests of The Wigwam. Oglala Lakota Chiefs Iron Tail and Flying Hawk considered The Wigwam their home in the East. Oglala Lakota Chiefs American Horse, Blue Horse, John Grass, Black Thunder, Whirlwind Horse, Turkey Legs, Lone Bear, Iron Cloud, Bear Dog, Yellow Boy, Rain-In-The-Face, Hollow Horn Bear, Kills-Close-To-Lodge, Red Eagle, Good Face (Eta Waste), Benjamin Brave (Ohitika) and Thunder Bull visited The Wigwam. Legendary Crow Chief Plenty Coups was also a welcome visitor.
An “old-time” Mohawk Council House of the Six Nations was erected for ceremonies and visits, and on one occasion 150 Indians camped in the forests of The Wigwam. The sound of tom-tom drums was frequently heard from The Wigwam.
Surprise visits, parties and gala celebrations were common at The Wigwam. In 1915, McCreight hosted a grand reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk. 
The Old Scouts.
“Old Scouts” Robert E. Strahorn, Captain Jack Crawford and Col. Buffalo Bill Cody shaped the popular vision of the American West through their images and narratives. At The Wigwam, the home of their friend Major Israel McCreight(""Cante Tanke"") in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, they could relax, smoke and talk about the Old West. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877, in later years they would not talk of it. All expressed remorse. 
Robert Edmund Strahorn (1852 -1944) is notable in American history as a war correspondent with the "New York Times", "Chicago Tribune" and the "Rocky Mountain News" during the Great Sioux War, a scout and publicist for the Union Pacific Railroad and a builder of the Pacific Northwest. Strahorn was a journalist and adventurer who shaped the vision of the American West. “No man knew the West as he knew it” and “few persons had a more active or important if less prominent part in the building of the West.”
John Wallace (Jack) Crawford (1847-1917), known as "The Poet Scout", was an adventurer, educator and author. “Captain Jack” was a master storyteller about the Wild West and is known in American history as one of America's most popular performers in the late nineteenth century. His perilous ride to tell the news of the great victory by Gen. George Crook against the camp of Chief American Horse at the Battle of Slim Buttes during the Great Sioux War made him a national celebrity.
William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody (1846 – 1917) was an Pony Express rider, soldier, buffalo hunter and showman. Buffalo Bill received the Medal of Honor in 1872 for service to the U.S. Army as a scout. Cody’s images and narratives of the American Wild West and Native Americans are nonpareil. During the Progressive Era, Buffalo Bill was one of most popular entertainers in America and Europe.
Old Scouts Strahorn, Crawford and Cody found adventure, glory and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877. Captain Jack’s race with Frank Grouard and perilous ride to tell the news of the great victory at Slim Buttes made him a national celebrity. Strahorn remarked that his service in the Sioux War won him undreamed of laurels. Cody's fight with the young Cheyenne warrior Yellow Hand and "First Scalp for Custer" launched his theatrical career with a force never before experienced in the relationship between the press and the fledgling world of show business. 
Battle of Slim Buttes.
The Battle of Slim Buttes and the destruction of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse’s village epitomized the excesses of U.S. Army and Indian warfare of the period. Indian villages were attacked at dawn, sacked and burned. Warriors were killed, captured and dispersed; food, lodges and supplies destroyed; ponies seized or killed; and many women and children killed in the confusion. The major military objective was to hit Indian commissaries and starve them into submission. “Humanistically speaking, the tactic was immoral, but for an army charged with subjugating the Sioux and other dissident Plains tribes, it was justified for the simple reason that it worked.” 
While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Sioux War, in later years they would not talk of it. Captain Jack and Strahorn were with General George Crook at the Battle of Slim Buttes and expressed remorse. Crawford declined to give any details of his observations at Slim Buttes. He said it was something he neither wanted to discuss or hear of; he said it hurt him even to have to think about it. Captain Jack said he had taken “one top-knot” at the Battle of Slim Buttes during a fight in which he “came near losing” his own hair. He later regretted his bloody deed and never spoke of it in his public performances 
Strahorn was always reticent when attempts were made to get him to relate his experiences while with Crook’s army. Like Crawford, he wished that the Slim Buttes affair could be stricken from the historical records; it was too painful for him to talk of it at all. Strahorn later recalled Chief American Horse and the ravine at Slim Buttes. “The yelling of Indians, discharge of guns, cursing of soldiers, crying of children, barking of dogs, the dead crowded in the bottom of the gory, slimy ditch, and the shrieks of the wounded, presented the most agonizing scene that clings in my memory of Sioux warfare.” 
Buffalo Bill would not discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He just shook his head and said it was too bad to talk about. While Cody did not participate in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior Yellow Hair. The engagement, often referred to as the "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.
Grand reception of 1915.
In 1915, McCreight hosted a grand reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk at The Wigwam. “When Chief Iron Tail was finished with greeting the long line of judges, bankers, lawyers, business men and neighbors who filed past in a receiving line just as the President is obliged to receive and shake the hands of multitude of strangers who call on New Years, the chief grasped hold of the fine buffalo robe which had been thrown over a porch bench for him to rest on drawing it around his shoulders, walked out on the lawn and lay down to gaze into the clouds and over the hundred mile sweep of the hills and valleys forming the Eastern Continental Divide. He had fulfilled his social obligations when he had submitted to an hour of incessant hand-shaking, as he could talk in English, further crowd mixing did not appeal to him. He preferred to relax and smoke his redstone pipe and wait his call to the big dining room. There he re-appeared in the place of honor and partook of the good things in the best of grace and gentlemanly deportment. His courteous behavior, here and at all places and occasions when in company of the writer, was worthy of emulation by the most exalted white man or woman!” After Chief Iron Tail had shaken hands with the assembled guests he gathered the big buffalo hide about his shoulders, waived aside the crowd and walked away. He spread the woolly robe on the grass, sat down upon it and lit his pipe, as if to say, “I’ve done my social duty, now I wish to enjoy myself.”
Chief Flying Hawk long remembered the gala festivities. “Here he himself and his close friend Iron Tail had held a reception once long ago, for hundreds of their friends, when bankers, preachers, teachers, businessmen, farmers, came from near and far along with their ladies, to pay their respects and say, How Cola!” “The historian Chief Flying Hawk reminded that when dinner was served, Iron Tail asked to have his own and Flying Hawk’s meals brought to them on the open porch where they ate from a table he now sat beside, while the many white folks occupied the dining-room, where they could discuss Indians without embarrassment. This, he remembered, was a good time, and they talked about it for a long time together, but now, his good friend had left him and was in the Sand Hills.”
Chief Flying Hawk.
The Wigwam was Chief Flying Hawk’s second home for nearly thirty years. Traveling with Wild West shows, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health. Chief Flying Hawk could have rest and relaxation at The Wigwam. Here he could rise with the morning sun for a walk in the forest, enjoy a breakfast of bacon and eggs, with fruit and coffee, smoke his redstone pipe and have a glass of sherry before retiring. Chief Flying Hawk, “refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets. With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight.” McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk’s grace and dignity, and described Chief Flying Hawk’s meticulous grooming. “The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur. From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear’s oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions. His hair, now still reaching to his waist, was streaked with grey. In reply to how Indians were able to retain their hair in such perfect condition, he said they did always retain it, sometimes they got scalped, but they prided themselves in caring for their bodies. He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground.” However, even in the relaxed atmosphere of The Wigwam, there was a formality to the visits. Of importance, Flying Hawk was an Oglala Lakota Chief and it was his duty to display his beautiful eagle feather “Chief’s Wand” during visits to The Wigwam. “At sun-up the Chief was missing. Breakfast was delayed. Presently, Chief Flying Hawk was seen coming from the forest which nearly surrounds The Wigwam. In his hand he carried a green switch six feet in length. From his traveling bag he took a bundle which he carefully unfolded and laid out, a beautiful eagle feather streamer which he attached to the pole at either end. After testing it in the breeze he handed it to McCreight with gentle admonishment to keep it in a place where it could always been seen. It was the Chief’s “wand,” and he said it must always be kept where it could be seen, else people would not know who was Chief. Having disposed of this, to him, important duty, the Chief was ready for breakfast.”
Joseph Blue Horse.
Joseph Blue Horse, the grandson of Chief Blue Horse, was a friend of Major Israel McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and full time resident of The Wigwam for three years. A veteran of World War I, Blue Horse went Wild Westing with Miller Brothers 101 Ranch and for many years was billed as “The World’s Champion Rider”. Later, Blue Horse was billed as a musician with the show. During his years at The Wigwam, Blue Horse preferred a traditional tipi to a bedroom in the home and was known affectionately as “Teddy”. Joseph Blue Horse assisted McCreight with estate duties and frequently visited local schools talking to children about Oglala Lakota heritage, singing songs and performing stunts.
Native American Heritage Center.
From 1906 to 1958, for over 50 years, The Wigwam was a Native American heritage center dedicated to educating the public about Native American history and culture; displaying a collection of gifts and tokens left by Native American friends to thousands of visiting school children, politicians and businessmen; and inviting visiting Native Americans to receptions and to speak at public schools. McCreight dedicated his life to educating the public about Native American history and culture, giving many speeches and inviting visiting Native Americans to speak at public schools.
The Wigwam was the home of Major Israel McCreight’s famous Native American collection. The collection was considered to be among the best-documented Native American collections in the nation and contained hundreds of historically significant items. Many artifacts were gifts and tokens of personal adornment left by Native American visitors in gratitude and friendship. McCreight carefully recorded the names, dates and occasions, later detailing the events in books he authored during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. During the fall of 1886, while residing in Devils Lake, Dakota Territory, McCreight a young man of 21, was given a special gift of a pipe and tobacco bag by Chief Wa-na-ta. McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta. These gifts marked the beginning of a collection of Native American artifacts to grow in national prominence and number during the next seven decades. McCreight was an historian and the collection served as an educational tool for the study of Native American heritage. The collection was publicly displayed at The Wigwam to local residents, school children, politicians, businessmen and Native Americans for over fifty years. The Wigwam was a treasure house of relics and thousands of school children, scouts and others interested in Indian lore had the opportunity of viewing the collection. McCreight dedicated his life to educating the public and “Young America” about Native American history and culture, giving many speeches and inviting visiting Native Americans to speak at public schools. Joseph Blue Horse from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota, resided at The Wigwam for three years and frequently visited local schools talking to children about Oglala Lakota heritage, singing songs and performing stunts.
McCreight knew many of the great Native American chiefs whose personal adornments filled The Wigwam, many of whom had been visitors to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and he spoke of their stories with great eloquence, esteem and kinship. Plenty Coups, Grand Chief of the Crows, was an occasional visitor to The Wigwam during President Warren G. Harding’s term. “The tall and dignified Chief took a lively interest in looking over the collection of Indian relics at the Wigwam.” “Flying Hawk related a time when he and Iron Tail spent an evening in the Indian room of the Wigwam going over all of the items there including pipes, war bonnets, moccasins, and other paraphernalia once belonging to Wanata, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull and other of their old-time friends. He said that Iron Tail told him it made him sad when he looked at all these things.” Chief Flying Hawk contributed his personal adornments and possessions to McCreight’s collection. “When my brother Kicking Bear died he was put on a grave on a hill. All his things are put in a grave with him. I will see his son, Kicking Bear, if they will let us dig open the grave and take out the arrow-head and send it to this wigwam to put along with my things.” When Chief Flying Hawk passed to the “Sand Hills” on December 30, 1930, McCreight expressed his kinship and esteem with a public announcement and exhibit in the Du Bois Public Library displaying hief Flying Hawk’s beaded jacket, pouch and pipe. Chief Flying Hawk was well known to the people of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and McCreight remarked, “The schools are much interested in the exhibit as well as others of the town who had met him on other occasions.” In his later years, McCreight attempted to donate the collection to museums, but without any success. McCreight cared for these national heritage treasures in The Wigwam until his death at the age of 94 in 1958. After his death, McCreight's Native American Collection at The Wigwam was sold and is now with private collectors and museums around the world.
Historic preservation.
The Wigwam is still standing and in need of historic preservation and restoration.
Buffalo Bill at The Wigwam.
A welcome home.
McCreight knew Col. Cody as a U.S. Army Cavalry Scout and Buffalo Bill visited Du Bois on many occasions. Buffalo Bill presided over McCreight’s adoption as ""Cante Tanke"", honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota]on June 22, 1908. Both had enduring lifetime friendships with Native Americans and special bonds to Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk. The Wigwam in Du Bois was always a welcome rest stop from exhausting travels and a chance to relax, smoke and talk about the Old West times. The Wigwam was a Native American heritage center and once the Eastern home of Oglala Lakota traveling with Wild West Shows.
McCanles incident.
Buffalo Bill’s visit to The Wigwam on June 22, 1908, was an event in Wild West history. On this occasion, Monroe McCanles was McCreight’s houseguest and told Buffalo Bill about his father Dave McCanles having been shot by Wild Bill Hickok. The “McCanles Incident” was the subject of controversy and debate by Wild West historians. Monroe McCanles disclosed that at the age of twelve he had stood beside his father Dave McCanles when Wild Bill Hickok shot him dead behind a curtain. For the first time, Buffalo Bill heard the facts of the historic event and remarked that he would include the story in his projected autobiography. McCreight wrote articles about the McCanles Incident the rest of his life.
Death of Iron Tail.
Chief Iron Tail was an international personality and appeared as the lead with Buffalo Bill at the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France and the Colosseum in Rome, Italy. In France, as in England, Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail were feted by the aristocracy. Iron Tail was one of Buffalo Bill’s best friends and they hunted elk and bighorn together on annual trips. On one of his visits to The Wigwam, Buffalo Bill asked Iron Tail to illustrate in pantomime how he played and won a game of poker with U.S. army officials during a Treaty Council in the old days. "Going through all the forms of the game from dealing to antes and betting and drawing a last card during which no word was uttered and his countenance like a statue, he suddenly swept the table clean into his blanket and rose from the table and strutted away. It was a piece of superb acting, and exceedingly funny.” Buffalo Bill regarded Chief Iron Tail as one of the greatest man he ever knew. McCreight and Buffalo Bill grieved over the death of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, Buffalo Bill said he was going to put a granite stone on Chief Iron Tail's grave with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Chief Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento.
However, Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the Buffalo, and the Scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West.
Last meetings with the Colonel.
McCreight next saw the Colonel in the main dining room of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was surprised at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about at the end of the long trail.” McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped him to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.
Eulogy to Buffalo Bill.
McCreight grieved for Buffalo Bill and wrote two poems in his honor.
when red ones wondered what to do to live when the white men stole away their feed. Then pony ridin’s past and gone and buffalo killin’s gone the rounds,
Felix Flying Hawk.
Sometime in the early 1900s McCreight received a scrawled hand written letter in pencil reading: ”Please send me three hundred dollars. I am in jail. I will send it back to you when I get out of jail.” The letter was signed Felix Flying Hawk. There was no date, heading or return address. However, the postmark showed Chadron, Nebraska, a few miles south the Dakota line just off the Indian reservation. McCreight knew Chief Flying Hawk, but did not know that he had any relative, much less a son. McCreight tells the story:
“Months went by, summer, fall, to midwinter with its deep snows and blizzards that constantly rage across the west Dakota Bad Lands. Then Felix wrote to ask why he had not received a letter to tell him that the thirty-five dollars had been received. No recollection of having received any refund, the files were examined, the record checked. Nothing to indicate it and a letter went back to his home address to say so. Within ten days, the money order, dated Rapid City, three months old, dropped from an envelope and the loan was repaid.
"“Days later another letter told of how he had bought the money order out of his first pay, mailed the letter, and returned to his home and family south again beyond the Bad Lands. Not having received acknowledgement, he wrote to know why, and on receipt of notice to the contrary, he immediately left for the hundred mile trip through the wild wastes in Arctic weather to the post office at Rapid City to learn what had happened to his long-lost letter. There, he found it still lying. He failed to put on the name of the state to which it was to be forwarded. ‘Pa.’ soon was added to the registered envelope, and Felix turned away for his hundred miles of return trip through the deep snows and wicked winds of winter. He had made good his word.”
Sometime in 1915, McCreight told the story of Felix Flying Hawk to the famous American writer, publisher, artist and philosopher Elbert Hubbard. Hubbard, a frequent visitor to The Wigwam in Du Bois was the author of the best-selling inspirational essay "A Message to Garcia". It was widely popular selling over 40 million copies and being translated into 37 languages. The book was about the Cuban insurrection against the Spanish and "to take a message to Garcia" was for years a popular American slang expression for taking initiative.
Theodore Roosevelt’s conservation policy on public education.
McCreight is noted in American history for authoring President Theodore Roosevelt’s conservation policy on public education.
McCreight brokered the purchase of land in north central Pennsylvania for coal and railroad interests, and saw millions of acres of forests reduced to a desolate waste of blackened stumps. He realized the great Eastern forests could have produced lumber for generations if care had been exercised and advocated a conservation policy based upon public education in the schools.
Beginning in 1906, McCreight argued that President Roosevelt’s conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education. McCreight urged President Theodore Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests. Conservationist Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the United States Forest Service, embraced McCreight’s recommendations and asked the President speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt issued an Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in our schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, “we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion.”
The Forest Cathedral.
McCreight was creator and steward of Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark, and a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association.
Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies. Once called the “Black Forest,” the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks.
The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated with McCreight on his first visit to the “Forest Cathedral” near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania. “It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered. Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment. It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them. The writer said to him: ‘Cook, no greater crime could be committed that to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity’s sake.”
McCreight was determined to save the forest and began a campaign to conserve the natural landmark. In 1910, McCreight and others formed the Pennsylvania Conservation Association and successfully lobbied the legislature to consider Cook Forest for state park purposes. For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the Cook Forest Association was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock.
On April 14, 1927, a bill was signed by Governor John Stuchell Fisher appropriating $450,000 on condition that the Cook Forest Association raise the remaining $200,000 to purchase the 6,055 acres. On December 28, 1928, the funds having been raised, the Secretary of the Department of Forests and Waters announced the formal purchase.
In January 1929, just a year after the purchase of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the Clarion River. The Seneca people of the Iroquois Confederacy once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight visioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also wonderful opportunity for McCreight’s Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam. The project was supported by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Cook Forest State Park stands as a monument to the memory and vision of Major Israel McCreight.
Cante Tanke "Great Heart" (Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka).
On June 22, 1908, "Buffalo Bill" Cody visited Du Bois with his Wild West Congress of Rough Riders. Twelve thousand people a day attended Cody’s Wild West performances and 150 Oglalas were in town with 150 ponies. After knowing the Oglala Lakota for almost twenty years, McCreight was adopted as an honorary Chief and named "Cante Tanke" ("Great Heart")(Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka). The ceremony was performed by Chief Iron Tail assembled at Buffalo Bill’s tent and attended by Chief American Horse, Chief Whirlwind Horse, Chief Lone Bear and 100 Oglala Lakota members of the Wild West Congress of Rough Riders. The Oglala Lakota chiefs formed a small circle around McCreight and Alice, and Chief Iron Tail began the ceremony with a speech in Oglala Lakota, a hearty handshake all around, and then placed war bonnet McCreight’s head and moccasins upon his feet. Chief Iron Tail presented McCreight with a tepee on which an owl had been traced with yellow chalk and told this was for him and Alice to live in. Tom-tom drums were then beaten and tribal songs put up vigorously. Concluding remarks were made by Chief Iron Tail ending with hearty handshakes. Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail were loaded into a new 1908 Rambler touring car and driven to McCreight’s town house for the banquet which followed. There Chief Iron Tail was presented with a new Winchester rifle as a souvenir of the event. McCreight was forever moved by the solemnity of the occasion, and carried the honor proudly and with distinction the rest of his life. McCreight later remarked that the title, honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota, was a far greater tribute than could have been conferred by any president or military organization. McCreight celebrated and honored Oglala Lakota culture, signing correspondence Tchanta Tanka or Tchanti Tanka, the phonetic equivalence of “Chann-Tey-Tonk-A”, the Lakota pronouncement of his adopted name Cante Tanke. McCreight was impressed with the intelligence, honesty and generosity of Native Americans. He studied Native American culture and languages, recorded his life events, wrote books and articles and maintained lifelong personal relationships. Photographs of McCreight’s wearing traditional dress portray his identification with the Oglala Lakota people. In 1929, McCreight’s nomination for U.S. Indian Commissioner was supported by the Oglala Lakota people. 
Death of Iron Tail.
In May 1916, Iron Tail became ill with pneumonia while performing with the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West in Philadelphia and was placed in St. Luke's Hospital. Buffalo Bill was obliged to go on with his show next day to Baltimore, and Iron Tail was left alone in a strange city with doctors and nurses who could not communicate with him. McCreight learned about the Chief's admission to the hospital in the morning Philadelphia paper, and immediately sent a telegram to Buffalo Bill to send Iron Tail by next train to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, for care at The Wigwam. No reply was had and the wire was not delivered or forwarded to Baltimore. Instead the hospital authorities put Chief Iron Tail on a Pullman, ticketed for home to the Black Hills. On May 28, 1916, when the porter of his car went to wake him at South Bend, Indiana, Iron Tail was dead, his body continuing on to its destination. Buffalo Bill expressed regret that the Chief was sent to the hospital and that he had not received the telegram. Iron Tail's body was transferred to a hospital in Rushville, Nebraska, then to Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where he was buried at Holy Rosary Mission Cemetery on June 3, 1916.
Chief Flying Hawk’s Commentaries.
For nearly 30 years, Chief Flying Hawk made periodic visits to McCreight at The Wigwam. McCreight collaborated with Flying Hawk, an Oglala Lakota Chief, to write an Native American’s view of U.S. history and classic accounts of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Crazy Horse and commentaries on Native American philosophy. Flying Hawk was a profound historian and philosopher. After Chief Flying Hawk died in December of 1931, McCreight dedicated his life to telling the Old Chief's life.
In 1936, at the age of 72, and after eight years of effort, McCreight published "Chief Flying Hawk’s Tales: The True Story of Custer’s Last Fight". McCreight followed with '"The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe" in 1943. In 1947, at the age of 82, McCreight published "Firewater and Forked Tongues: A Sioux Chief Interprets U.S. History". 
David Flying Hawk.
David Flying Hawk was the eldest son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a Wild Wester and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. On March 25, 1927, Chief Flying Hawk wrote McCreight for assistance, reporting that David had been arrested and jailed for horse stealing.
McCreight well recalled the story of David’s father Felix Flying Hawk, jailed in the early 1900s for stealing his own horses, and the injustice visited upon Native Americans. However, despite McCreight’s considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David’s family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix’s farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight. “And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody can not help to work on our farm, and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings.” McCreight reported that, “My investigation shows that he was charged with stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands. It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials. There seems little or no legal remedy for it.” David Flying Hawk later became Treaty Chairman of the South Dakota and Seven Camp Fires, pursuing the United States Government for broken treaty obligations.
Sun Dance at Rosebud.
Summons to Rosebud.
In the Fall of 1928, McCreight (""Cante Tanke"") was notified by Chief William Spotted Tail of the coming big gathering of western tribes for the last Sun Dance at Rosebud Agency, South Dakota. "The notice was rather a command than an invitation.” “There was to be a "fifty-years'" celebration at the old Rosebud Agency where the ceremony of the Sun Dance, stopped by the Government forty-five years ago, was to be performed. All the old-time Indians were to be there.” 
Chief Black Thunder.
“Stepping out on the wobbly porch for a look around the old agency compound, a wrinkled old man in slouch hat and white man's discarded coat stood leaning on a long staff. He had part of a loaf of stale bread enclosed in his left arm, held closely as if it was precious, and from it he tore off chunks with his right hand and stuffed them into his mouth and ravenously gulped them down. It was pathetic to see. Turning to the landlady for an explanation, she said the man was Chief Black Thunder, and she had given him the bread because she could not bear to see him suffering from hunger and cold. He was eighty-four and nearly blind from trachoma. In the brick building across the parade ground, a short distance from the eating place, stood the agency office, and nearby was the commissary and storehouses of the government, representing the nearly two billions of money and property belonging to the Indians, administered by the more than five thousand agents, employees, superintendents and welfare experts of the Indian Bureau, on salaries high and low, much of which was taken from the
Indians' funds.” 
The Sun Dance of 1928.
“It was an amazing sight. Here encamped over a great saucer-like basin were twenty thousand Indians, with nearly as many more horses and dogs, covering an area of two to five miles. The tepees scattered singly and in villages over a whole region.” “Like the Red Man’s formula for religious guidance, there were four days of the Sun Dance, four musicians to sing and drum, the music-dancing in sets of four, eight or sixteen; four big speeches, four dips in the councils-east, west, north and south.” 
Old friends.
McCreight delighted in seeing his old friends. “In wandering about the wide spaces, several old time acquaintances were met, John Grass, Lone Feather, White Rabbit, Kills-Close-to-Lodge, Bear Dog, Frank Goings, American Horse, William Spotted Tail, president of the great meeting, Eta Waste, a Custer fight survivor who reminded us that he had once been at the writer’s wigwam some thirty years ago.” “Here a short call on the agent and to inquire for Chief Flying Hawk who had failed to get to the Sun Dance. But to learn he had just left for a visit to Sitting Bull’s grave at the northern agency.”
Five warrior cousins.
Chief Flying Hawk was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877.
The Last Sun Dance of 1877 is significant in Lakota history as the Sun Dance held to honor Crazy Horse one year after the great victory at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and to offer prayers for him in the trying times ahead. Crazy Horse attended the Sun Dance as the honored guest but did not take part in the dancing. Five warrior cousins sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1887. The five warrior cousins were three brothers, Flying Hawk, Kicking Bear and Black Fox II ("Young Black Fox"), all sons of Chief Black Fox, also known as Great Kicking Bear, and two other cousins, Eagle Thunder and Walking Eagle. The five warrior cousins were braves and vigorous battle men of distinction.
Big hullabaloo.
The Sun Dance evolved into a War Dance to protest the white man invasion. “A big hullabaloo came with the arrival of Vice President of the United States Charles Curtis and a long line of motor cars loaded with newspaper reporters, camera men and politicians. They interrupted the ceremonies, offending the performers so that they refused to continue for the gratification of the movie-men. They were many Indian votes short in the following election. This white man invasion disturbed things for the rest of the session, resulting in the Omahas and Pottowattomies joining in an “exhibition” war dance. Soon, the Utes, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Crows, Blackfeet, Pawnees and the rest all collected for a grand intertribal dance on the vacant section behind the show grounds. Qualified observers said there were ten thousand taking part in this mammoth demonstration. It was kept up until darkness shut it from view. It was a strange, an altogether unheard of thing to witness, thrilling to a degree to turn one’s head and leave him atremble between joy and sorrow. It was marvelous to behold!” 
Wounded Knee.
"Rosebud is the district where bones turn to stone. Even in recent years, as when the father of Crazy Horse went to examine his son’s tomb, the custom of Indians in old times, he sound the skeleton had petrified. He had placed the body in a secret cave so that white men could never know where his body was or contaminate it by so much a white man’s touch. Past He Dog’s Village; past one-room log cabins with broken and rusted farm implements strewn about, mostly with a tepee on the outside, ground uncultivated and dead; nothing green. Past a little church once painted white, cross on a low steeple, and set in a field of little white crosses, reminder of sad ending of babies and youth unable to survive in the environment denominated “reservation” by a “charitable” government. Even jack rabbits and birds were absent in this long desolation. But it was good enough for Indians by the white man’s laws. Miles and miles, and finally a little creek bed was crossed to a service pump, and tiny store, it was Brennan, P.O., and just at the rear was the little monument at the head of the trench where the soldiers who murdered them, buried the frozen bodies of men, women and children to the number of two hundred and ninety, shot down with machine guns to let lie for two days in sub-zero storms (90 men 200 women and children). In one pile of bodies were two mothers whose babes were clasped close to the breast and within their heavy blanket shawls. When tearing the heap of frozen dead apart to be loaded into army wagons for transport to the big ditch, the two babes were found to be alive.” “This was the ‘revenge’ of the troops for the wiping out of Custer’s army at the Little Big Horn fourteen years before, but it was a discreditable show for the great United States Army to thus turn Hotchkiss machine guns on a crowd of starving and helpless and wholly harmless women and children! History has not, even to this late day, justified it. Many of the former acquaintances and friends of the writer were present, and some of them were killed.” “It was a depressing sight for the writer who could in memory review the surrounded band in rags, shivering in cold and weak from irrepressible hunger over months of fruitless search for game to supply them what was denied them by crooked agents and grafting politicians, and had been trailed like wild animals by the relentless army, and finally driven, like cattle to the slaughter, at the unattractive fields we gazed upon.” 
Of all McCreight’s colorful accounts, none show his essence more than the Sun Dance at Rosebud Agency. He had been summoned to Rosebud by the great Chiefs. McCreight connected to the red man and disdained the white man’s ignorance and utter destruction. He too one day would go to the Sand Hills to join the Ancient Ones. But not before he fulfilled all of his responsibilities as "Cante Tanke". A few months later, McCreight was nominated for U.S. Indian Commissioner of the Department of the Interior. 
U.S. Indian Commissioner nomination.
In April 1929, McCreight was nominated for U.S. Commissioner for Indian Affairs by Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Department of the Interior. McCreight was considered a national figure in Indian lore and among the two or three men in the United States having the best knowledge of the American Indian and their affairs. McCreight received many endorsements including the National Council of American Indians of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and the Oglala Sioux Tribe representing “eight thousand and 300 Indians.” McCreight was not to receive the appointment and President Herbert Hoover chose Philadelphia financier Charles James Rhoads. McCreight noted: “My education being red school house and hard knocks, did not measure up to Hoover’s class. Rhoads is a fine fellow, Quaker, College-bred and rich. However, I value the endorsement of the Indians more than I would have the endorsement of Mr. Hoover, so there you have it.”
Lakota at Cook Forest.
In January 1929, just a year after the purchase of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the Clarion River. The Seneca people of the Iroquois Confederacy once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight visioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also wonderful opportunity for McCreight’s Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam, and he proposed that Good Face, William Spotted Tail, John Sitting Bull and Flying Hawk, with their families, be invited to live in Cook Forest. McCreight explained his proposal to the U.S. Indian Field Service of the Department of the Interior in Wood, South Dakota: “I wish you would see Good Face and talk with him about the Cook Forest Park. It is likely that he with his wife would very much enjoy coming to stay at least for a time in this beautiful place. He would be among the best people always and have all the rights and liberties that he would care for, and I am sure it would more than pay too. The Clarion River runs through the property, and he could have his bark canoe, go fishing, if permitted, and his duties would be to watch the fires and act as a guide and keep up the trails, etc. I think it would be arranged that he would have a salary, and his wife would get considerable by selling bed work out to the tourists. It was my idea that they could have not only a log house but tepee which they could move at will and there are many beautiful places along the river and in the forests, to camp in the summer.”
The project was supported by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested in the use of the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. Good Face has been here before. He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.
The Great Depression and final days.
McCreight was hit hard by the market crash of October 29, 1929, on the onset of the Great Depression and sold timber and land surrounding The Wigwam for income. He dedicated the rest of his life to public education about Native American culture.
In 1957 McCreight wrote, I "have been getting old for several years, a day at a time." At the time he was 92 years old and would soon become ill. Ray Fadden, known as Mohawk leader Chief Aren Akweks, a frequent Wigwam visitor, wrote McCreight in 1958:
"Brother your message tells us that soon you will take the Sunset Trail where our ancient Fathers will welcome and greet you as one of themselves. It will make our hearts unhappy when you leave us. You will be remembered by the truths you have written in your many books and articles about the Indians and though your body may pass on your thoughts will continue to live, will speak for us. During your life on this Earth, you have done many good things and our hearts are with you. You are an Indian born again in a white body, sent here by our creator to tell the world today the true story of our people. When you leave Mother Mother Earth and the Ancient Ones will welcome you with outstretched arms. The prairies and forests will look golden and green to you and your moccasins will walk on smooth grasses. The sky will be blue and from the bark lodges you will see smoke rising into the sky. Your ears will hear the good music of singing and the tom toms and those you see will be smiling at you as you walk to greet them. Remember this, Brother, this is how it will be for you. Your brother, Aren Akweks.”
McCreight died in 1958 at age of 93 and is buried in Morningside Cemetery, Du Bois, Pennsylvania. Alice B. Humphrey McCreight, his wife, died in 1965 at the age of 98, and is buried at the side of her husband, Major Israel McCreight.

Storyline.
Madison James appeared in Salem for a business meeting with Brady Black (Eric Martsolf) and Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston). She is introduced as the CEO of Mad World Cosmetics, a company that Titan Industries was interested in acquiring. After an awkward encounter with Brady prior to their meeting, the three got down to business and stuck a deal for Titan to purchase Mad World Cosmetics. Madison also showed off her determination and fearless to go against competitor Kate DiMera (Lauren Koslow), her competition in the cosmetics world. Not only did she have Brady and Victor in her corner, but she also hired her childhood friend, Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney), as her junior executive.
Brady and Madison began flirting almost immediately. Despite her stance that she doesn't date men that she works with, they continued their flirtation. During a blackout at the Titan offices, Madison opens up about her past and her family, which leads to the pair becoming closer, and eventually sharing a kiss. Supporting Brady, she urges him to visit his father John Black (Drake Hogestyn), who was currently in custody under house arrest, on fraud charges.
To avoid her blooming feelings for Brady, Madison focused her efforts on taking down her professional competition, Countess Wilamena. Madison hires childhood friend Sami to devise a plan of staged arguments in front of Kate, to make Kate think that Kate could hire Sami away from Mad World. While devising her plan against Kate, Madison's relationship with Brady turns stale when he begins to give her the cold shoulder. Confused, she takes the initiative. and kisses him on impulse, eventually leading to a night of passion; following their night together, they agree to give the relationship a chance. Despite agreeing with Brady to keep their relationship secret free, Madison continues to receive mysterious phone calls about her being in Salem. Madison and Brady are them railroaded when their plan backfires, and Sami quits MadWorld to go work permanently for Kate at Countess Wilhelmina. However, under Madison's plan, it is revealed that Sami did not truly quit Mad World, and is acting as an informant and company spy for Madison inside Coutness W.
Brady and Madison continue to spend their time together, on both professional and personal levels. Madison lends her support and OK to Brady for his decision to leave Titan and join his father at Basic Black.
When her relationship with Brady begins to hit a standstill, Madison agrees to end her crusade against Kate and the pair admit their love for each other. Realizing their love Brady proposes to Madison; before an answer could be given a mystery man, Ian McAllister (Ian Buchanan), arrives in Salem and states that he is Madison's husband. Ian instructs Madison to break off her relationship with Brady, claiming it as untrue. Madison then blames Brady for the failure of the relationship, reminding him that she told him to keep the relationship strictly professional. He then says he didn't know her like he thought he knew her. He confesses that he's never worked as hard for a woman as he had with Madison, trying to break down her barriers. Brady then tells Madison to leave the Kiriakis Mansion and to never look his way again, officially ending his relationship with her.
In February 2012, Victor announced that Ian would be taking over the CEO of Titan Industries. After finding out his secret with Madison, Victor attempts to rescind the offer, but Ian declares it's too late. Brady visits Madison in her hotel room and demands the know the whole truth. She reveals that she met Ian in college while running MadWorld out of her trunk. Madison then reveals that Ian had many conquests during their marriage and that he put Kate above all of the rest. Madison confesses that Ian expects her to be weak when he's around and that she's tried to change things, but she owes him, with Ian making it clear he would not be letting Madison go under any pretense.
After attempting to divorce him, Ian insists on staying with Madison, even framing her into the marriage stating that if she continued her relationship with Brady he would pursue federal charges against him. Ian finally agrees to divorce Madison, allowing her to go on with her relationship with Brady as she wished. The two reconnect, with Brady immediately proposing marriage once again; this time, she answered yes. Ian then dropped the bomb on Madison that Kate would be invited to become a co-CEO of Mad World to work alongside Madison as competition against Sami and her reign on Countess Wilhelmina. As Brady and Madison continue on with their relationship, eventually becoming engaged and the pair begin to plan their upcoming wedding. Their happiness is once again put at risk when it comes to light that Brady may be on drugs once again, actually being poisoned by Ian. Madison confides that if he did not take a drug test, after seeming off during a meeting at the Brady Pub, she would not enter into another unstable marriage. When Brady agrees to the a take drug, and it turns out to be positive, Madison leaves feeling betrayed by Brady.
During a special event being held in honor of the late Dr. Lexie Carver (Renée Jones), Madison plans to wed Brady. However, when he does not show up for their pre-ceremony, she goes to leave. After being stopped by Ian, an explosion hits and knocks them unconscious. When Ian comes to, he finds Madison and tries to awaken her. In his arms, Madison cries out for Brady and tells him she loves him; she dies in Ian's arms.

Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club

Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club (BCYC) is a yacht club located in Newport Beach. Orange County, California.
History.
In 1958 ten yachtsmen founded the club as "Bahia Yacht Club" in a room leased from the Balboa Bay Club. In its early days the club was made up mostly of racing sailors who were well known in Southern California yacht racing. In 1968, the club joined with the Orange Coast Yacht Club and changed its name to "Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club" because of the recognition commodore Pat Dougan had brought to the club when he purchased the 12-metre class Columbia, a boat that had won the America's Cup with Walter Podolak.
Facilities.
The clubs locations was for many years leased from the Irvine Company In 1993, the land and marina was purchased from the Irvine Co. to become one of the first yacht clubs in California to own its land and marina. The Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club facility, dedicated in 1971, has a main dining room and outdoor seating, as well as both wet and dry slips available for members for a monthly fee. 
The wet slips can accommodate boats up to 80 feet in length, and the dry slips are for smaller boats up to 25 feet in length. The club is open 5 days a week, plus a full-time dock staff and shore boat.
Americas Cup.
The Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club was the first West Coast yacht club to create an Americas Cup Contender when Pat Dougan entered "Columbia" in the 1964 America’s Cup Trials

Anti-seborrheic

Anti-seborrheics are drugs effective in seborrheic dermatitis. Selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithinone, corticosteroids, imidazole antifungals, and salicylic acid are the popular anti-seborrheics.
Ideal anti-seborrheic.
An ideal antiseborrheic should have the following qualities:
Specific anti-seborrheic agents.
Selenium sulfide.
Selenium sulfide slows down epidermal proliferation. It is fungicidal to "Pityrosporum ovale". It also acts as an anti-keratolytic. Selenium sulfide is also known to reduce dryness of scalp and folliculitis. It is to be noted that systemic toxicity can appear if it is applied to inflamed skin. Hypersensitivity reactions are noted in some people.
Zinc pyrithinone.
Like selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithinone also reduces epidermal turnover and inhibits fungal growth. It is often administered with ketoconazole for better results. The symptoms do not resolve completely even after prolonged medication.
Corticosteroids.
Topical steroids are used to relieve the symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. It has a fungicial action, and reduces dandruff. The disadvantage is that it has a high relapse rate on discontinuation. Prolonged use can cause poor healing of wounds.
Imidazole antifungals.
Only a few imidazole antifungals are effective against seborrheic dermatitis. Ketoconazole was found to be the most active against Pityrosporum ovale. It is available in both oral and topical formulations. It is also available as cream, gel and tablet. Unlike other drugs, it does not cause skin irritation or phototoxicity. Clotrimazole is also used in treating seborrhoea.
Other drugs.
Other drugs like sulfur and resorcinol have also been found useful in treating seborrheic dermatitis. These drugs have keratolytic and antiseptic properties which may benefit seborrhoea. Salicylic acid has a mild effect on seborrhoea.

John Fewster

Dr John Fewster (1738-1824) was a surgeon and apothecary in Thornbury, Gloucestershire. Fewster, a friend and professional colleague of Edward Jenner, played an important role in the discovery of the smallpox vaccine. In 1765 Fewster read a paper to the Medical Society of London entitled “Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox”, 31 years before Jenner’s experiment on James Phipps.
In 1763, Fewster noted that two brothers (named Creed) had both been variolated (purposefully infected with smallpox) but that one did not react at all to variolation. On questioning, this subject had never had smallpox, but had previously contracted cowpox. This prompted Fewster to wonder whether cowpox might protect against smallpox, a notion of which he was previously unaware. He is reported to have discussed this possibility over a Convivio-Medical Society dinner at the Ship Inn in Alveston. He also encouraged others to take up the inquiry. Amongst those at the meeting was Edward Jenner, a young medical apprentice at the time.
Fewster followed up this observation, but only to a limited extent and not in writing. In 1765, he presented a paper called ‘Cowpox and its ability to prevent smallpox’ to the Medical Society of London, but never published it.
In 1796, Fewster was called to visit a local boy who was ill with early smallpox and was asked by John Player, the boy’s uncle, whether he would consider inoculating the boy with cowpox to save him from smallpox. According to Player Fewster replied that he had already thought of this but had decided against it as, in his view, variolation was very successful and an alternative seemed unnecessary. Nonetheless, Player reports, Fewster went on to inoculate three children in Thornbury with cowpox, during spring 1796. These vaccinations took place at around the same time as Jenner's first vaccination attempts.
Fewster never made any claim to have discovered vaccination.

Erik Parker was born in Stuttgart, Germany but later moved to San Antonio, Texas. Parker attended the University of Texas at Austin with artist Peter Saul before receiving a master of fine art from Purchase College in New York.
Erik Parker is known for his precisely painted and organized worlds of chaos that exist within his brightly colored, intensely layered, highly saturated canvases. Parker's work depicts unique, fantastical scenes of biomorphic subjects and unworldly landscapes. Parker methodically paints each composition to the optical extreme creating an intense visual experience. His work maintains a premeditated sense of order all the while suggesting an underlying madness through his use of bold and fragmented forms. Parker employs many styles in his work, from graffiti to psychedelic album covers and cartoons. Drawing from elements of American subculture, Parker creates color infused paintings that illustrate his take on the pressing issues of our time.

Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg (30 July 1537 in Augsburg – 4 March 1592 in Tempzin Abbey) was a son of Duke Albert VII of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. He was administrator of Ratzeburg and of the Commandery of Mirow.
Life.
At the urging of his elder brother John Albert I, the cathedral chapter appointed Christopher as the successor of Bishop Christopher I of Ratzeburg in 1554. Christopher thus became the first Lutheran administrator of the Bishopric.
In 1555, he was also elected coadjutor of Bishop William of Riga, with the right of succession. His election was controversial and led to armed clashes. During a clash on 1 July 1556 in Koknese, Christoper and William were both taken prisoner. They were released in 1557, and Christopher was recognized as coadjutor. However, when William died in 1563, Christopher found himself unable to exercise his right of succession. Instead, he was taken prisoner again during renewed fighting against Poland. He was released in 1569, after he had renounced all claims on Riga. After his release, he returned to Mecklenburg.
He died on 4 March 1592 and was buried in the northern chapel of the high choir of Schwerin Cathedral. His widow commissioned a grave monument, which shows a couple kneeling before a "prie-dieu". It was crafted in the workshop of the Flemish sculptor Robert Coppens, with assistance from the Pomeranian painter Georg Strachen.
Marriages and issue.
Christopher married his first wife on 27 October 1573 in Kolding. She was Dorothea (1528 – 11 November 1575), a daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark. She died only two years later, in Schönberg, which was the capital of the Bishopric of Ratzeburg.
He married his second wife on 7 May 1581 in Stockholm. She was Elizabeth (4 April 1549 – 12 November 1597), a daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden. With her he had a daughter:
After Christopher's death, she returned to Sweden, where she lived in Norrköping. She died in 1616 and was buried in Uppsala Cathedral.

The village was the home of the British writer Gerald Brenan in the 1920s, and he described its customs in "South from Granada", one of his better-known books. In recent years the village has held events commemorating the writer's interest in local culture. A Brenan museum is being developed in the village.
History.
Most of its inhabitants are descendants of people from the northern regions of Spain (mostly from Galicia) that were brought to the village after the Expulsion de los Moriscos in the 16th century.
At the end of the 19th century and all across the 20th century, Yegen, like most of the country, was a land of emigrants that left for better opportunities in Europe (Andorra, Germany, Switzerland) and America. This situation reversed in the late 1980s and now there is a small community of mostly British and other European citizens that have bought houses in Yegen as a first or second residence.

<doc id="36667216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36667216" title="Length extension attack">
Length extension attack

In cryptography and computer security, length extension attacks are a type of attack on certain types of hashes which allow inclusion of extra information. 
This attack can be done on hashes with construction H("secret" ∥ "message") The SHA-3 algorithm is not susceptible to this attack. 
Explanation.
The vulnerable hashing functions work by taking the input message, and using it to transform an internal state. After all of the input has been processed, the hash digest is generated by outputting the internal state of the function. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the internal state from the hash digest, which can then be used to process the new data. In this way one may extend the message and compute the hash that is a valid signature for the new message.
Example.
A server for delivering waffles of a specified type to a specific user at a location could be implemented to handle requests of the given format:
The server would perform the request given (to deliver a waffle of type eggo to the given location for user 1) only if the signature is valid for the user. The signature used here is a MAC, signed with a key not known to the attacker. (This example is also vulnerable to a replay attack, by sending the same request and signature a second time.)
It is possible for an attacker to modify the request, in this example switching the requested waffle from "eggo" to "liege." This can be done by taking advantage of a flexibility in the message format: duplicate content in the query string give preferences to the latter value. This flexibility does not indicate an exploit in the message format, because the message format was never designed to be cryptographically secure in the first place, without the signature algorithm to help it.
In order to sign this new message, typically the attacker would need to know the key the message was signed with, and generate a new signature by generating a new MAC. However, with a length extension attack, it is possible to feed the hash (the signature given above) into the state of the hashing function, and continue where the original request had left off, so long as you know the length of the original request. In this request, the original key's length was 14 bytes, which could be determined by trying forged requests with various assumed lengths, and checking which length results in a request that the server accepts as valid.
The message as fed into the hashing function is often padded, as many algorithms can only work on input messages whose lengths are a multiple of some given size. The content of this padding is always specified by the hash function used. The attacker must include all of these padding bits in his forged message before the internal states of his message and the original will line up. Thus, the attacker constructs a slightly different message using these padding rules:
This message includes all of the padding that was appended to the original message inside of the hash function before his payload (in this case, a 0x80 followed by a number of 0x00s and a message length appended at the end). The attacker knows that the state behind the hashed key/message pair for the original message is identical to that of new message up to the final "&." The attacker also knows the hash digest at this point, which means they know the internal state of the hashing function at that point. It is then trivial to initialize a hashing algorithm at that point, input the last few characters, and generate a new digest which can sign his new message without the original key.
By combining the new signature and new data into a new request, the server will see the forged request as a valid request due to the signature being the same as it would have been generated if the password was known.
This attack has mostly been used for forging signed data, but it does have other possibilities.
Implementations.
One tool which uses OpenSSL to implement this attack for various hash algorithms is HashPump. This tool supports the Length Extension Attack for MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512. SHA224 and SHA384 are not vulnerable to this attack due to their reduced output of their state variables, instead of all their state variables. Another tool is Hash Extender.

The Rabelo boat is a traditional Portuguese cargo boat that for centuries was used to transport people and goods along the Douro river.
Native from the Douro region, it does not exist in any other place of the world. Its history is closely linked to the production and trade of port wine. Before the arrival of the railway, the rabelo was the fastest and the most efficient means of transport between the Douro Valley, where port wine is produced, and the city of Porto, where it was traded and exported world wide.
Although not in use anymore, still today we can admire these graceful vessels belonging to the Port Wine Companies in the banks of the Douro river, in the cities of Porto and Gaia.
Every year on June 24, St. John's Day, is held a race of Rabelo boats, an important and popular event of the festivities of Porto city.

Pashupatinath Temple shooting

The Pashupatinath Temple shooting was a mass murder that occurred at the Pashupatinath Temple and its surrounding area in Mandsaur, India on July 23, 1983. 28-year-old police constable Ramesh Sharma (रमेश शर्मा) killed 14 people and wounded 9 others, before he was shot and killed by police.
Shooting.
At about 7:30 p.m. on July 23, Ramesh Sharma, who was assigned to guard duty at the Pashupatinath temple that day, entered a tea shop adjacent to the temple, armed with a Lee-Enfield and his pockets bulging with cartridges. He aimed his rifle at the shop owner's nephew, Pradeep, and asked him "Should I shoot you?", before killing him. 
Sharma next shot at Rakesh Jain, owner of an idol shop at the temple, hitting him in the shoulder. While Jain stumbled into the nearby Hanuman temple, Motia Bai, owner of another shop in the area, started shouting at Sharma in rage. Sharma shot dead both Motia and her son Hari, before turning his attention again towards Rakesh Jain. After taking off his shoes he entered the temple and shot Jain at point-blank range through his abdomen. Sharma afterward put back on his shoes and left. 
Outside he was approached by another policeman posted at the temple that evening, Kanhaiyalal Dube, who wanted to calm him down, but before Dube could say a word, Sharma shot him dead. The gunman then entered the Pashupatinath temple where an aarti, attended by about 60 people, had just begun. Sharma fired a few shots at the pilgrims, wounding several of them, before shouting to halt the aarti, though the priest, Ramachandra Shukla, apparently unaware of what was going on, raised his hand to silence him. Sharma killed the priest by shooting him in his arm and head.
At around 7:45 p.m. Sharma left the temple area and headed towards the town, where he killed another seven people in the streets. Police by then was already notified, but it took them another 40 minutes to stop the gunman. At about 8:20 p.m. Sharma was engaged by policeman Mewa Lai. He fired a shot at the officer, that missed its target, but killed an 18-year-old woman named Sakina. Mewa Lai then returned fire and killed Sharma with a shot in the chest.
Within 50 minutes Sharma had fired 34 rounds, killing 14 people and injuring nine others; one cartridge remained in the chamber of his rifle, while another 35 were found in his pockets.

Iotrochota birotulata

Iotrochota birotulata, the green finger sponge, is a species of demosponge in the phylum Porifera. It is found in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea.
Description.
The green finger sponge usually has upright or sprawling cylindrical branches that occasionally divide. The branches are about in diameter and can grow to in length. Young individuals and some large specimens have an encrusting habit. They grow over the surface of a rock in a layer a few millimetres thick with occasional short chimney-like outgrowths. Other individuals have a number of vertical tubes, each with a large opening called an osculum at the end. These variations in growth habit led to the belief that several different species of sponge were involved. However, specimens growing in reef caves often have an encrusting base with a central, finger-like cluster of branches, so it is now believed that the different forms are a single species, perhaps differing in structure because of different environmental conditions. In the branched form, the osculi are found on the upper side of the branches and may be slightly raised above the surrounding tissue. The consistency of the sponge is soft but resilient, and when squeezed, it exudes a purple fluid. The general colour of the sponge is purplish black but there is often a layer of bright green cells on the epidermis. These have dendritic patterns on the surface and cover sub-surface canals which lead to the osculi.
Distribution and habitat.
The green finger sponge is found in the Caribbean Sea at depths varying from . Its range includes the West Indies, the Bahamas, southern Florida, Venezuela and northern Brazil, but it is absent from Bermuda. It inhabits reefs, the deeper water outside the reef crests and the underside and surfaces of rocks in shallow bays.
Biology.
The golden zoanthid ("Parazoanthus swiftii"), a colonial coral, is often found twined round the sponge in a symbiotic relationship. The polyps look like small sea anemones and contain toxins which deter predatory fish from eating the sponge. The coral benefits from the increased volume of food particles its polyps can capture as water is drawn through fine pores into the sponge.

Lincoln Place Apartment Homes

Lincoln Place Apartment Homes is a historic apartment community owned by a subsidiary of Apartment Investment and Management Co. (Aimco). Inspired by the garden city movement, it is located at 1050 Frederick Street on a 35-acre site in the Venice community of Los Angeles, one mile east of Venice Beach. Built from 1949-1951, the property is just off Lincoln Boulevard, bound by Lake Street and Penmar Avenue with Elkgrove Avenue and Elkgrove Circle within its interior. The property has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Lincoln Place Apartment Homes is an example of World War II- work force housing, financed under Section 608 Title VI of the National Housing Act of 1934. The community was originally built to house veterans returning from the War.
Housing Shortage.
The passage of the G.I. Bill at end of World War II caused a housing shortage in the United States, with low- to middle-income families finding few rental property options. The Santa Monica Bay area was especially affected as the opening of Douglas Aircraft’s plant in 1940 and the Los Angeles Airport in 1947 led to an increase in housing demand. To combat the housing issue, the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) “created a mortgage insurance program, whose low cost of lending and liberal valuation of land would encourage developers to meet this housing need.” 
Ralph A. Vaughn (1907-2000), an architect trained at the University of Illinois, was the son of a prominent Washington D.C. architect, Roscoe I. Vaughn. Upon meeting Heth Wharton, they formed Wharton & Vaughn Associates, and were tasked with designing Lincoln Place.
Between 1951 and 1986, Lincoln Place was family-owned.In 1986, Lincoln Place was purchased by TransAction Companies, Ltd with Robert Bisno and James Coxeter as the two main partners. 
In 1990, Bisno announced a plan to raze Lincoln Place and develop condos on the site; however in 1996, the LA City Council rejected the development plan which resulted in Bisno filing suit against the city.
In June 2001, Aimco became a 50% partner in Lincoln Place; and in August 2003, Aimco Venezia LLC, an Aimco affiliate became 100% owner of Lincoln Place Apartment Homes.
Controversy.
 In September 2000, Bisno began a revised development plan which was to include the demolition of 2 buildings and the rehabilitation of the remaining 50. Approximately 300 families moved out of Lincoln Place during this time with vacant units taken off of the rental market. 
In May 2002, Amanda Seward working with the Modern Committee of the LA Conservancy filed a nomination for Lincoln Place to be added to the National Register of Historic Places. In November of that same year, the City Council re-heard Bisno’s condo proposal. Finding that there was “no substantial evidence” that Lincoln Place was an historic resource, Bisno’s plan was approved. This sparked a lawsuit against the city by the Lincoln Place Tenants Association. 
Bisno filed applications in January 2003 for five demolition permits but was rejected. He filed a suit against the Department of Building and Safety requesting permits under the Ellis Act. However, in February 2003, the State Historic Resources Commission determined Lincoln Place was eligible for the National Register. The commission forwarded the nomination and recommendation to the Keeper of the National Register, at which time the file was open for 45 days. During these 45 days, Bisno demolished two buildings. The Keeper returned the nomination asking for additional information. 
In May 2003, permits were issued for five buildings along Lake Street. Several groups, including the California Preservation Foundation, LA Conservancy and the National Organization of Minority Architects filed suit against the City, citing the California Environmental Quality Act and the LA Municipal Code. They also unsuccessfully appealed the demolition permits with the Building and Safety Commission. A total of 99 units were demolished. 
In November of that year, the LPTA lost its suit against the City; and in January the preservationists lost their case in trial court. Both groups appealed.
In March 2004, Aimco began asbestos work related to redevelopment of the property.In July 2004, Amanda Seward submitted a nomination requesting that Lincoln Place be deemed eligible for the California Register of Historic Places. In March, 2004 the Court of Appeal issued an order to prevent further demolition of structures at Lincoln Place. 
From 2004 to 2006 Aimco relocated tenants in more than 250 units while providing alternative housing and relocation benefits. A number of tenants were able to become first time homebuyers as a result of receiving relocation benefits. In March 2005 Aimco filed a “Notice of Intent to Withdraw” the apartments from the rental market as permitted by the California Ellis Act. Tenants in 289 occupied units were served notices requiring tenants to vacate units within 120 days. 
Evicted tenants filed a lawsuit, claiming that “Aimco violated conditions of the California Environmental Quality Act as well as an agreement with the city of L.A. to relocate tenants to other units or properties instead of evicting them.” The Second District Court of Appeals eventually ruled in the tenants’ favor. Of the 147 households engaged in the legal battles, many accepted relocation packages (including funds for moving expenses) offered by Aimco.
Resolution.
Designation on California Register of Historic Resources.
On August 4, 2005, the California State Historical Resources Commission declared that Lincoln Place was eligible to be placed on the California Register of Historical Resources. According to the Commission, Lincoln Place exemplified an “excellent enduring example of both the 'garden city' property type and of Modernist architecture." In addition, the Commission cited the unique site plan and Lincoln Place’s position as one of the only local “major surviving example(s) of post World War II moderate income housing.” Subsequently, Aimco applied to the National Park Service to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nomination was approved on December 15, 2011.
Settlement.
In May 2009, Aimco signed a settlement agreement with Amanda Seward and the 20th Century Architectural Alliance which settled and concluded all claims concerning Lincoln Place. The agreement requires that the Secretary of Interior’s standards be followed for historic rehabilitation at Lincoln Place. A total of 696 units will be restored and 99 new units are to be constructed on vacant lots. In August, 2009 Aimco signed a settlement agreement with the former occupants of the site which allows up to 83 former tenants to return to Lincoln Place. 50 exercised their option to return. 
In May 2010, the Los Angeles City Council approved a settlement reached between Aimco and the City which settled and concluded all claims in connection with Lincoln Place. The agreement includes City cooperation for permitting and support for funding to make Lincoln Place a model of sustainability and historic preservation.
Today.
Project Plan.
Aimco plans to rehabilitate the existing 45 buildings (696 units) and construct 99 new units: 59 units on Lake Street and 40 units on Frederick Street. In addition, common areas and amenities will be added, including a new leasing center and fitness facility. In all, the construction and renovation of Lincoln Place Apartment Homes will create between 600 and 800 jobs to the Los Angeles area, including green jobs. 
The rehabilitation of Lincoln Place Apartment Homes has been separated into three distinct phases. The current plans for each phase are as follows:
Phase I: Units for returning tenants.
The first phase of rehabilitation renovated four buildings available to returning tenant. These homes have minimal upgrades (including electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems) at the request of the tenants in order to maintain the original aesthetic of Lincoln Place. 
Items repaired, replaced in kind or retained included wood accent siding, decorative façade elements, walled patios (ground floor only), cabinets, floors and fixtures.
New appliances, roofs and updated landscaping have been added to Phase I units. This phase was completed in April, 2012.
Phase II: Rehabilitation.
The second phase of rehabilitation will focus on the remaining 39-40 existing apartment buildings including 28 units redeveloped by the previous owner under a separate permit. Renovations will include kitchen expansions, bathroom upgrades, new ground-floor patios and renovation of existing patios. Two-bedroom floor plans will add an additional bathroom.
Interior Features.
Interior features will include hardwood flooring, granite and quartz counters, solid-wood cabinetry, Energy Star appliances, gas ranges, in-home washer and dryer, central air conditioning and private balconies and patios. All apartments will be pet friendly.
Exterior Features.
Aimco plans to maintain the integrity of the original construction. All existing buildings and detached garage buildings will be preserved, as well as the original stucco and wood siding. Windows will be repaired if possible or replaced in kind. 
The irrigation system at Lincoln Place Apartment Homes will undergo a complete overhaul to improve efficiency and sustainable landscaping including drought-tolerant vegetation will be installed. Existing carports will be enclosed to form more private garages.
Phase III: New units and construction of new leasing and recreation buildings.
The final phase of renovation includes plans for the development of 99 new ground-up apartments and leasing and recreation center buildings. 
The new apartments will be constructed on vacant lots where the buildings were demolished. New buildings will be compatible with the existing buildings.
Community amenities at Lincoln Place are planned to include a 2-story recreation and fitness facility with state-of-the-art equipment and group classes, a rooftop social deck, outdoor swimming pool with cabanas, grilling area and fire pit, garage parking and cyber café.
Sustainability Goals.
By retrofitting the existing apartment homes with energy-efficient appliances; low-flow toilets, shower heads and aerators; Energy Star-compliant light fixtures and high-efficiency washers and dryers, the redevelopment of Lincoln Place Apartment Homes will emphasize sustainability. New multi-layered roofing systems will be installed, and insulation will be introduced to the attic areas. 
New landscaping will include the retention of more than 350 existing healthy, mature trees plus the addition of more than 150 new trees. The irrigation system will be replaced resulting in water conservation and reduce leakage, and moisture sensors, rain gauges or storm track systems will be installed.

XB130 (gene)

XB130 (also known as AFAP1L2) is a cytosolic adaptor protein and signal transduction mediator. XB130 regulates cell proliferation, cell survival, cell motility and gene expression. XB130 is highly similar to AFAP and is thus known as actin filament associated protein 1-like 2 (AFAP1L2). XB130 is a substrate and regulator of multiple tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling. XB130 is highly expressed in the thyroid and spleen.
Molecular structure.
The XB130 gene is located on human chromosome 10q25.3 and encodes an 818 amino acid protein. It has a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa and is structurally similar to actin-filament-associated protein (AFAP) and is thus known as AFAP1L2. Several tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a proline rich sequence are included in the N-terminal region of XB130, which allows it to interact and activate c-Src-containing proteins, as well as bind to p85α of PI3K. Two pleckstrin-homology domains are located in the middle portion, giving XB130 its lipid-binding ability. The C-terminal region contains a coiled-coil domain, which shares partial similarity with AFAP's leucine zipper domain. Both the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of XB130 are required for XB130's role in its translocation to the lamellipodia. Despite XB130's structural similarity to AFAP, XB130 does not behave like an actin filament-associated protein. The actin-binding site present in AFAP is only partially present in XB130.
Function.
Role in cell motility and invasion.
During cytoskeletal rearrangement, a process required for cell motility, XB130 translocates to the cell periphery. XB130 exhibits a high affinity for peripheral F-actin structures, such as the lamellipodium. The translocation of XB130 to the cell periphery is particularly important in its potential to influence cell migration and metastasis.
Role in gene expression.
The level of XB130 expression influences the expression of multiple genes related to cell proliferation and survival, and microRNAs miR-33a, 149a, and 193a-3p, all of which exhibit tumor suppressive function in thyroid cancer cells.
Role in inflammation.
XB130 mediated c-Src binding and activation increases Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine produce by lung epithelial cells, which contains AP-1 and SRE transcription factor binding sites. These binding sites can be activated by the downregulation of XB130 expression and lead to a decrease in IL-8 production in lung cells.
Interactions.
XB130 (gene) has been known to interact with
Clinical significance.
Adaptor proteins play an important role as molecular scaffolds to mediate the transport and interaction of various proteins and is therefore highly involved in signal transduction. Deregulation of adaptor proteins is highly related to the abnormality of cellular functions and many adaptor proteins are frequently overexpressed in cancers. Clinical studies on the expression level and pattern of XB130 in various human tumors demonstrate that XB130 expression is regulated in thyroid and gastrointestinal cancers and soft tissue tumors. Expression level of XB130 was significantly higher in normal and benign lesion than that of papillary and anaplastic/insular carcinoma. Through the studies on many gastrointestinal cancers, the oncogenic roles of XB130 was showed. XB130 expression is significantly correlated with the survival time and disease-free period in gastric cancer patients. XB130 was identified as a potential colorectal cancer markers. XB130 protein level was elevated in human esophageal squamous carcinoma. In addition, XB130 was selected as one of six highly expressed genes related to local aggressiveness of soft tissue tumors in a set of 102 representative tumor samples. These findings suggest that XB130 may be involved in tumorigenesis and that XB130 is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.
Discovery.
This adaptor protein was discovered during molecular cloning of human actin filament associated protein (AFAP1) in the Latner Thoracic Surgery Research Laboratories Toronto, Canada. The molecule is named named XB130 after lead technician Xiaohui Bai and the molecular mass of the protein. This protein was found to have a high sequence identity to AFAP1, thus its name AFAP1L2.
